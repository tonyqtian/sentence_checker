Government-subsidized housing for low-income residents is one way to redistribute social wealth and ensure decent living conditions for those who can hardly afford commercial housing.
Giving the right people access to such housing is a challenge for government and affects social stability.
Despite explanations from affected local government departments about the living standards of these employees, the facts show that some unqualified people get such houses through deception.
Local governments involved are also not doing enough to ensure that the right people stay in these homes.
When government employees stay in subsidized houses that are half the price of commercial ones, that points to corruption and a problematic policy that favors privileged groups such as civil servants and people with powerful connections, and erodes social justice and equality.
Even more dangerous, affected low-income residents will very likely despair and lose confidence in their government.
That is exactly the root cause of a number of conflicts between some residents and local authorities.
Making sure the right people get affordable housing is in the interest of this country's political and social stability and long-term development.

MILAN - AS Roma coach Claudio Ranieri described Serie A leaders Inter Milan as 'stratospheric' on Sunday but he has still not given up hope of snatching an unlikely title from Jose Mourinho's pocket.
Acid-tongued Mourinho might have accused bitter rival Ranieri of having his head in the clouds had the Portuguese not snubbed the media again.
Possibly facing league action for joking last week that Roma would pay relegated Siena to beat Inter in the final game of the season next weekend, Mourinho decided to resume his press blackout after his side overcame Chievo 4-3.
It was left for Ranieri to do the talking after Francesco Totti scored twice in a 2-1 comeback win over Cagliari which sent the Serie A title race into Sunday's final round.
Champions League finalists Inter have a two-point lead over Roma, who visit Chievo in their season finale.
While Ranieri dreams of a shock scudetto, his former side Juventus were plumbing new depths on Sunday.
The Turin club, which surprisingly axed Ranieri towards the end of last season when it was in third place, is languishing in seventh spot after a 3-2 home defeat by Parma.
A hefty fine or even a stadium ban could now hit Juve after the game was suspended for a short time because disillusioned home fans were throwing firecrackers at the away section.

In China's 35 main cities where housing market data was monitored by the newspaper, 21 saw their trading volume of commercial housing area go down last week, with the figure in Hangzhou going down 73 percent.
The government's new regulation policies have an obvious effect on curbing speculation in cities where property prices are going up too fast, and China's property market will enter a long wait-and-see period as the new policies take effect, an analyst said.
BEIJING - China pledged to develop a stable and long-term relationship with Germany on Tuesday, one day after the surprising resignation of German President Horst Koehler.

At the invitation of Wen, Merkel is paying her fourth visit to China.
Apart from Beijing, she will visit Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi province.
SRINAGAR, India-controlled Kashmir - The local government in India-controlled Kashmir Wednesday called in Indian army to contain civilian protests and help maintain law and order in Srinagar city, the summer capital of the region, officials said.
The step was taken to enforce indefinite curfew imposed in city, where four people including a 25-year old woman were killed in police and paramilitary action on Tuesday.
The authorities have also canceled curfew passes issued by the district authorities earlier, including those of journalists.
There are reporters that photographers and journalists too were stopped from moving out.
This measure can lead to media gag in the region.
Officials said army has also staged flag march in some localities.
The civilian deaths on Tuesday triggered fresh spell of protests in the Srinagar and added to the already volatile atmosphere prevalent in the Muslim majority areas of the region over the past one month.
The region witnessed massive protests against Indian rule in recent weeks over the killing of 15 civilians in police and paramilitary shooting on protesters since June 11.
SRINAGAR, India - Police and paramilitary troops fired on thousands of anti-India protesters in Kashmir, killing at least three people in the worst street violence in a year, police said.
While anti-India demonstrations are frequent in the region, the latest round of street protests was triggered by a police investigation earlier this month that found Indian army soldiers had killed three Kashmiri civilians in May.
The investigation said the soldiers staged a gunbattle in order to claim the dead were militants.
The army responded by suspending two officers.
Clashes broke out across the region again Tuesday, and three civilians were killed in the town of Anantnag, 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of the main city of Srinagar, police said.
Local residents said that one of the dead, Ishtiyaq Ahmed Khanday, 15, was not part of any protests and was killed in the compound of his home.
Meanwhile, thousands of police in riot gear patrolled the city of Srinagar, where shops, businesses and government offices were shut.
Police and paramilitary soldiers drove through neighborhoods warning people to stay indoors and not participate in pro-independence protests, said Afaq Wani, a Srinagar resident.
He said police were imposing a de facto curfew.
Sajad Ahmed, a local police officer, said that no curfew has been imposed but that the state government has banned the assembly in public of more than five people.
Troops also erected steel barricades and laid razor wire across main roads to prevent public gatherings.
XINZHOU: Police in north China have detained one man and seized 10 fake journalist IDs following reports that jobless young people were pretending to be reporters to blackmail local mine owners.
On March 18, Guangdong-based newspaper Southern Weekly reported that many jobless young men in Shanxi's Xinzhou posed as journalists and used their knowledge of the mining businesses to blackmail company bosses and low-level government officials.
According to the article in Southern Weekly, the fake reporters went to unlicensed mines, showed their fake journalist IDs and threatened to expose them.
The mine managers would give them hush money of around 1, 000 yuan (US$146).
It is said that some of the fake reporters had indeed been licensed reporters at one time and had the ability to publish stories with the help of media friends.
BEIJING - Four steel companies in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have announced that they will merge as part of a central government plan to consolidate the sector, the local municipal government said on Wednesday.

ZHENGZHOU - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has called on local authorities and farmers to achieve a quick summer grain harvest.
Wen made the call during his inspection tour of Henan province, a major wheat-producing area in Central China, from June 9 to 10.
Wen said a good summer harvest and stable farm produce prices are crucial for managing inflation expectations and for realizing the nation's macro-economic targets this year.
A bumper summer harvest will lay a solid foundation for the full-year harvest as summer grain output accounts for a quarter of annual grain output, he added.
Agriculture is a cornerstone for the national economy and the nation must always attach great importance to agricultural production, he said.
Social networking sites (SNS) are fast becoming the number one method for many Chinese people to communicate with others, while concerns over individual privacy mounts, according to a report on the development of new media in China issued Wednesday.

Companies can not only gather users' personal information including phone numbers and MSN accounts on the SNS sites, but can also figure out the users' propensity to consume and family and work status through analyzing the information.
The report said profiting from users' personal information which was gained by cheating has become an important source of income for SNS sites.

8 percent to $42.
3 billion, the highest level in 18 months, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
In May, exports rose by 2.
4 percent to $152.
3 billion, while imports increased by 2.

The joint project, with an estimated investment of $1.
5 billion, is expected to annually produce 33 million tons of raw iron ore, along with 10 million tons of refined iron ore, the sources said.
With a controlling share of the new joint venture, WISCO would have the final say on the exploration and operation of the Australian iron ore mines.
With an average annual production of 30 million tons, WISCO ranks seventh among steel makers in the world on a production scale.
However, WISCO receives 80 percent of its iron ore from overseas and is facing a survival crisis caused by the spike in iron ore prices on the international market.

75 million tourists visited the island from January to April, up 23.
3 percent year on year and 525, 000 were mainlanders.
The number of mainland tourists to Taiwan has increased rapidly since the island lifted a ban on mainland tourists in July 2008.
The island attracted 606, 000 mainland tourists in 2009.
Up to 25 mainland provinces and municipalities have gained travel access to the island, while residents in the other six will be allowed to tour Taiwan from July 18.
The mainland-based Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association expects more than a million mainland tourists to visit Taiwan in 2010.

The profit growth rate in May was 1.
2 percentage points lower than in April, the statement said without elaborating.

According to a notice posted by the Beijing municipal bureau of human resources and social security last Wednesday, enterprises in the capital that enjoy a sound development and achieve an increase in their profits are supposed to provide a 11 percent pay rise to their employees.
The maximum increase for workers' wages is set at 16 percent and the minimum at 3 percent, the notice said.
However, those enterprises still suffering from the financial crisis are entitled to ignore the rules and can even decrease their workers' remuneration with the approval of the labor unions or staff representatives.
Zhao Dixin, an accountant at a State-owned energy company in Beijing, said she supports the new guideline, although it will lead to a decrease in her salary.
Hebei leads the new guidelines, allowing employers to give workers a salary increase of up to 28 percent, with the minimum pay rise stipulated as 8 percent.
There are some who wonder why manufacturing hubs like Guangdong province and Zhejiang province have yet to publish their guidelines, since they have just experienced a spate of strikes staged by workers demanding an increase in pay.
A research conducted by Fuzhou Border Control showes that there are about 2831 left-behind children in its jurisdiction, most of whose parents run their own business, or are working as migrant workers outside.
Juvenile delinquency among those children has become a problem and attention is to be paid to this issue, especially over the summer months when boredom sets in among these children.
Cases involving thefts and fights have been on the increase, reaching 135 since 2008.
However, things are changing now.
Fuzhou Border Control has organized a series of activities allowing these children to enjoy happy holiday this summer.
A special care center is established in every jurisdiction, in which the children can play games and do their homework.
In addition, the border control also arranges for video chats between parents and their children.
For those who are not able to be cared for by their grandparents, they can spend the holiday in the center and the center will provide them with physiological assistance.
Left-behind children, also known as stay-at-home children, is a group of children whose parents are work outside the province and they are left at home to be reared by their grandparents.
These children do not receive adequate love from their parents.
They have become a disadvantaged group in Chinese society in its transition to a free market economy.

Beijing: The cold night air didn`t stop the crowds of students cramming together to celebrate Earth Hour with rock `n` roll at an university in Beijing Saturday night.
Although not many dormitory rooms responded to the 10-second countdown to switch off light at 8: 30 pm, the dazzling sports stadium certainly went dark as the bravos echoed from the audience to the organizers` words: [protect the earth and act on climate change".
The open-air concert, organized by School of International Trade and Economics in University of International Business and Economics (UIBE), invited not only the popular university singers but also professional rock groups like Nanwu Band, who performed hits like [Don`t Forget Our Memory and Don`t Forget Our Dream.
`\nThe concert also marked the end of Environmental Protection Week, during which photos of the latest sandstorm in north China were displayed in campus to promote environmental protection awareness.
Environmental activists also urged students to support the Earth Hour through a number of different ways.
[Please help turn off the light when you find nobody in a classroom, please do not use more than one electric lamp when studying, please eat the ice cream in the refrigerator as it will melt-" a post published on the university`s website said.
Editor's Note: \nThey are nearly 100-million strong; they were born and grew up in the countryside, but they no longer share their parents' love for the land; they find their jobs in the cities, but they also find it hard to call them home; they are the so-called post-80s and post-90s generation, but they are different from their urban counterparts - they are migrant workers.
A new generation of migrant workers, who are distinctive from their predecessors - their mothers and fathers: They have higher levels of education; they strive for better working conditions and wages; and they hope to be part of the city life.
Still, they are migrant workers, unable to enjoy equal social rights as the urban residents.
At least for now, as the central government signals changes at the ongoing annual National People's Congress, China's parliament.
In Jinjiang city, Fujian province, young workers can be found doing their jobs at manufacturing factories or just enjoying dorm life, talking with their friends, playing pool or exercising.
They are also at a job market in Jinjian, eagerly perusing the fliers and seeking information.

BEIJING - Chinese prosecutors investigated nearly 2, 800 judiciary workers suspected of corruption among other work-related crimes in 2009, a government report released Monday said.
The annual report on China's legal system construction in 2009 published by the China Law Society said prosecutors at all levels disallowed the arrest of more than 123, 200 criminal suspects last year.
The China Law Society is an academic organization of legal experts and practitioners.
Headquartered in Beijing, it has over 410 local branches across China.
BEIJING - China said Tuesday it is seriously concerned about a scheduled joint naval drill between the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK) in the Yellow Sea.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang made the remarks at a regular press conference.
The relevant parties should refrain from doing things that might escalate tensions and harm the security interests of the countries in the region, Qin noted.
The four-day anti-submarine drills were originally scheduled for last month, as part of the response to the sinking of an ROK warship in late March, which killed 46 sailors.
The ROK announced in May that the navy warship was torpedoed by a submarine of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), but the DPRK immediately denied involvement in the incident, saying the investigation results were fabricated.
According to latest reports, the military exercise may be conducted after any possible UN action against the DPRK over the warship issue.
BEIJING - A top Chinese military official on Thursday objected to the proposed joint military exercise between the United States and the Republic of Korea in the Yellow Sea.
Soon after it was announced, the anti-submarine drill was delayed to mid-June, then again postponed to the last week of June.
On June 28, the ROK again delayed the drill to July, according an ROK official, to ensure the US' attendance.
The confusing signals sent out by the two sides on whether the aircraft carrier USS George Washington would take part in the drill has made the exercise an even hotter topic.
Debates in the US have revealed concerns about angering China, as there are currently sensitive military relations between the two countries.
TIANJIN, July 7-- Taiwanese who invest in the Chinese mainland would be among those who benefit most from a recently signed landmark economic pact across the Taiwan Strait, a mainland official said Wednesday.
Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said the signing of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) between the mainland and Taiwan presents more opportunities than challenges to Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland.
He told attendants of the third Tianjin-Taiwan Investment Cooperation Forum held in the northern industrial city of Tianjin that the pact would help Taiwanese businesses cut costs in the flows of materials, personnel and capital, further explore the mainland's markets, and obtain financial and technological support and services.
He said opportunities are plentiful for Taiwanese businessmen, particularly because the mainland is shifting its economic growth mode.
Wang added that his office would push for the implementation of the ECFA in a bid to allow businesses to benefit from the pact as soon as possible.
Wang said the departments under his watch would continue to provide policy support to Taiwanese investors for their companies to grow and expand on the mainland.
The ECFA, signed by negotiators from both sides of the Strait on June 30, aims to establish a systematic mechanism for enhancing cross-Strait economic cooperation.
HANGZHOU, July 4 -- A new regular direct passenger sea route between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan was officially opened Saturday after a ship safely returned from Taiwan.
The passenger ship, Coscostar, returned to the Damaiyu Port, Taizhou City of eastern Zhejiang Province Saturday, making it the second port on the mainland that has served the regular direct sea route with Taiwan, said He Jinliang, deputy head of the city's Taiwan affairs office.
On June 26, the ship, carrying more than 500 passengers, traveled about 302 km to the Keelung Port of Taiwan, He said.
With a tonnage of 26, 800, the ship, owned by the China Ocean Shipping Companies Group, could carry about 600 passengers, 256 containers and 150 automobiles.
The ship is scheduled to shuttle once a week.
It will depart from Damaiyu in Yuhuan County on Saturday night and return the following Friday.
The single trip would take eight to nine hours, traveling at various speed.
Wang Yihao, deputy head of Yuhuan County, said the standard ticket costs 600 yuan (88. 6 U. S. dollars) and the deluxe class ticket costs 1, 000 yuan.
In August 2009, the first regular direct sea route was launched to link eastern Fujian Province's Xiamen Port and Taiwan's Taichung Port and Keelung Port.

Chongqing is blanketing its streets with real-time computerized monitor towers and sending more police and security guards to schools in the latest move to ensure public security, Chongqing Evening News reported Tuesday.
Following a slew of attacks on school children this year, over 70 percent of middle and primary schools and kindergartens will have a special school police team -- at least a policeman, a security staffer and two security guards for every school, the report said.
5, 222 police, 6, 400 school security staffers and 40, 000 security guards have been sent to schools so far in the municipality.
The police officers for schools are specially-trained in combat, and are experienced in emergency situations such as earthquakes and fire accidents.
One standard for all recruits is their ages – male police should be over 55 years old, and females 53 years old.

KUNMING - Three houses collapsed in southwest China's Yunnan Province Monday, killing four children from two families, said government authorities.
The accident occurred at 8 am Monday in Maliuzhuang Village in Qilin District.
Days of continuous rains might have triggered the collapse of the empty house, a villager said.
The dead were said to be aged from four months to five years old, and their parents were believed to be migrant workers from Guizhou Province, the statement said.
Further, the injured were taken to hospital for treatment and their injuries were reportedly not life threatening, according to the statement.
Local authorities are investigating the cause of the tragedy.
Jining: Over 100, 000 people have been relocated since the 1990s due to collapsed land caused by coal mining in East China`s Jining city, one of 13 coal production bases in China, the People's Daily reported on Monday.
There were 350, 000 mu (23, 300 hectares) of sunken land by the end of 2009, and it is still increasing by 30, 000 mu per year in Jining, said Liu Xuping, the city`s Director of Bureau of Land and Resources.
In Heshangtang village of Jining, local farmers had to use scissors to harvest wheat as water submerged the sinking field, making it impossible for reaper machines to access it.
In another village, a farmer named Bian Wenjie used to have three mu of arable land, but has only half a mu.
Although Bian was provided with a new house after relocation, she is worried about what will happen when she gets old and works 15 kilometers away from her home.
The underground water system has been destroyed by the mining, roads and bridges have been ruptured, and water and electrical facilities are damaged, causing an economic loss of 500 million yuan ($73 million) each year.
Liu also said the total area of collapsed land may reach up to 700, 000 mu by 2020, affecting more people and reducing the arable area.
According to the report, local government complained it lacked adequate funds to relocate villages affected because most of the tax levied from the mining industry belonged to the provincial and central government.
BEIJING - Typhoon Conson is likely to make landfall between Ledong and Wanning in south China's Hainan province before Friday night, said the National Meteorological Center (NMC) Friday.
Conson was about 260 kilometers southeast of Sanya, a famous tourist resort in Hainan, at 5 am Friday and moving towards the northwest at a speed up to 20 kilometers per hour.
The wind near the typhoon center was about 119 kilometers per hour.
The typhoon will bring heavy rains to southwestern Guangdong Province, southeastern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Hainan Friday.
NMC also issued an orange alert for the typhoon, the second highest level, at 6 am Friday.
Those areas covered by the alert should vigorously guard against flooding and geological disasters, said the statement.
Conson, a Vietnamese word meaning historic sites, earlier this week hit the Philippines leaving 23 people dead.

BEIJING: State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) has pumped more than 1.
5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Turkmenistan to China as of June 27, China Petroleum Daily reported on Thursday.
Gas travels nearly 2, 000 kilometers through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan before entering Chinese territory in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur autonous region.
China and central Asian countries opened in late last year their first cross border natural gas pipeline, which will be able to pump up to 40 billion cubic meters of gas to China by 2012-13.
BEIJING - A searing heat wave that has scorched many parts of China has brought the country's daily electricity generation to its highest level ever, touching 12.
93 billion kilowatt-hours on Monday, according to data from the National Power Dispatch and Communication Center.
The figure was 6 percent higher than the past record, which occurred on July 21 last year, said Zhu Weijiang, deputy chief engineer with the center.
The heat wave is affecting at least 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC), which issued an orange-level heat alert on Tuesday, the second highest level.
At the Shanghai World Expo, the electricity load surged to 110, 000 kilowatts from 70, 000 kilowatts at the Expo's opening, which added pressure to power grid of Shanghai and east China.
Zhu forecasted that power consumption would peak in late July or early August this year, when the national electricity load might climb to 13.
5 billion kilowatts, up 10 percent from a year ago.
Power grid companies would strengthen monitoring and forecasting of increases in electricity demand and make better power distribution plans, so as to avoid a power shortage this summer, Zhu said.
The moderation was partly due to a higher base a year earlier when China's power production rebounded to a positive growth rate, the newspaper report said.
The paper, issued by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said since the 1990s online forums have become an increasingly important gateway for expression of public opinions.
The paper pointed out that in recent years Internet usage in the country's rural areas and western part had increased at a quicker rate than the more developed urban areas and eastern part.
Of the 384 million Internet users in the country by the end of 2009, over 100 million were from rural areas, according to the paper.
China had invested 4.
3 trillion yuan in Internet infrastructure construction, the paper added.
HONG KONG: Apple is missing out on an opportunity to further expand in China, the Financial Times reported late on Sunday, citing Lenovo's Chairman Liu Chuanzhi.

Officials from Lenovo and Apple were not immediately available for comment.
Victor Young, Director of Public Relations of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, said the company has reorganized its research institutes to help the company design more than 40 car models annually before 2015.
In the first half of 2010, Geely sales reached 195, 734 units, up 42.
1 percent from the same period last year.
The company aims to sell 400, 000 vehicles for the full year.
The automaker has put 24 cars on show at the 7th China Changchun International Automobile Fair which opened Thursday.
More than 900 car models are displayed at the fair.
Geely earlier said it has won approval from the European Union regulators to buy Sweden's iconic Volvo Cars.
The company said it expected to finish the acquisition in the third quarter of this year.
Zhejiang Geely has yet to pick a site for the China plant for the premier Swedish brand, but the capital Beijing, Chengdu in the southeast and Ningbo in the east, are among the options, it said.
Volvo S40 and S80 models are currently made at Ford's China car venture Changan-Ford-Mazda.
Production of S40 will be halted in the future, the newspaper said, but made no mention of the fate of S80.
A Geely spokesman declined to comment.
In March, Geely signed a deal to buy the Swedish brand for $1.
8 billion, marking the country's biggest auto purchase overseas.
JINAN: Senior Chinese Political Advisor Wang Gang has called for efforts to step up economic restructuring, optimize the industrial structure and improve innovation capability.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) newspaper Minju Choson issued a commentary on Tuesday, accusing the US and South Korea of planning to hold large-scale joint military exercises in the West Sea of Korea.
According to the commentary, the exercises were a joint military operation between the United States and South Korea aimed at preparing for an aggressive war against the DPRK, a plot intended to launch a preemptive attack on the DPRK.
The commentary said the exercises would cause an armed conflict and even an all-out war.
So it is an important mission and urgent issue for the DPRK to block the aggressive move of the United States and South Korea to defend peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, Asia and the whole world.
The commentary stressed that the DPRK army and people should follow the moves of the United States and South Korea with vigilance and make all preparations for any situation.

OAXACA, Mexico - A strong 6.
2-magnitude earthquake struck southern Mexico early on Wednesday, leaving one man dead and shaking buildings as far away as Mexico City but sparing infrastructure from serious damage.
The US Geological Survey said the quake struck near the town of Pinotepa Nacional, around 80 miles (125 km) southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Police patrols checking surrounding towns did not report fallen buildings.
In the small coastal village of San Andres Huaxpaltepec near the epicenter a falling beam crushed a 46-year-old man as he slept at home, said Luis Zarate, head of the emergency services service in the state of Oaxaca.
In the historic center of the city of Oaxaca people felt the tremor strongly and several hotels were evacuated briefly.
The USGS reported the quake as magnitude 6.
5 but later revised the figure to 6.
2, also moving the epicenter slightly.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had no warning or advisory in place and hotels in beach resorts like Puerto Angel also reported no damage.
Tremors awoke residents in Mexico City nearly 300 miles (470 km) to the north, and cut power in some districts.
Some people filed onto the street in their pajamas, but there were no reports of casualties in the city, where many have grim memories of a devastating earthquake in 1985.
Power and phone connections were still working.
Mexico is regularly shaken by tremors and nerves are strained since devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile earlier this year.

The United States and other Western countries have accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons, a charge denied by Iran.
WASHINGTON - The US government confirmed on Monday that at least 12 US citizens have been detained in Yemen, but refused to specify whether they are linked to al-Qaida.
Yemeni authorities reportedly have arrested some 30 foreigners in recent operations against the AQAP, which is on Washington's list of foreign terrorist groups.
The Yemen-based AQAP was accused by the United States for masterminding numerous terrorist acts against Saudi, South Korean, Yemeni and US targets since its inception in January 2009, including the failed attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on December 25, 2009.
PARIS - Justine Henin received a standing ovation on Monday as she walked off Court Suzanne Lenglen but it would have had a hollow ring for the Belgian after her script for a joyous French Open return had just been torn to shreds.
Rafa Nadal stayed firmly on course for a fifth happy ending at Roland Garros though as the Spaniard matched world number one Roger Federer's feat of reaching the quarter-finals without dropping a set.
Shame then that Henin, one of the greatest exponents of claycourt tennis the world has seen, will be missing.
The four-times champion showed flashes of her old brilliance en route to the fourth round, her sublime backhand occasionally sparked and the old fire still burns inside.
But she never quite scaled the heights she reached when completing a rare hat-trick of titles here in 2007 and that was the case again on Monday when the 27-year-old lost 2-6 6-1 6-4 to Australia's Samantha Stosur.
Stosur, a surprise semi-finalist last year, sabotaged an eagerly-anticipated quarter-final between Henin and Serena Williams but was well worth her victory as she, not Henin, moved through to face the American world number one.
As grey clouds again blanketed the French capital Williams sped into the last eight with a 6-2 6-2 defeat of Israel's Shahar Peer despite a shocking start in which she handed over the opening seven points on Court Phillipe Chatrier.

SHANGHAI - Expatriates living in Shanghai are most content with the service industry of the city, according to a report released by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Shanghai Committee recently.
The number of expatriates in Shanghai reached 152, 100 by the end of last year, about 0.
International hotels scored the highest among all the 37 surveyed items.
The service provided by department stores and supermarkets in Shanghai also scored high in the survey.
But stores hidden in residential communities are an attraction for foreigners.

CCB is 12 percent owned by Bank of America and 6 percent owned by Singapore state investor Temasek.

9 the double ninth day in the lunar calendar, is the result of urbanization.
The number of stay-at-home children is around 58 million, amounting for 28 percent of the total children in rural areas, according to the All-China Women's Federation.
The lack of the companionship of parents results in an absence of custody, care and home-education.
With their husbands becoming migrant workers far away from home, the 50 million stay-at-home women usually have to shoulder all the burdens of the family including doing the manual labor, cooking for the family, doing the laundry and running other errands from day to night.
The lack the companionship also leads to a higher divorce rate.
As for the elderly, many of them can not live a happy life since they also share the labor work, and have to take care of the kids when they are at home.
To satisfy the need of the stay-at-home family, materially and spiritually, the central government has put forward a series of policies to help combat the problem.

HOHHOT - Two people have been jailed for intentionally damaging a section of the Great Wall in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, prosecutors said Thursday.
The two men surnamed Zhang and Tian were sentenced to three years in prison with a four-year reprieve for drilling two holes and four trenches into the Great Wall of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) in northern Hohhot, the regional capital, according to a written statement released by the Hohhot Procuratorate.

The case was similar to one in 2008, in which five miners received jail terms ranging from one to three years in Inner Mongolia for damaging a section of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) Great Wall.
The construction of the Great Wall dates back to around 200 BC when Emperor Qin Shihuang (259-210 BC) had fortification walls built to stop invasions from northern tribes.

Volvo manufactures, distributes and sells a wide range of passenger cars under the Volvo brand worldwide, and it is also active in supplying components.

In addition, China`s aging population will grow tremendously along with the continued implementation of family planning, which will worsen the situation.
This requires Chinese education departments to be aware of the further development of the national higher-education system, including the total number of universities and university specialization.
Gu said that more and more parents are aware of the value of special skills for youths, and are cooling toward traditional university education.
Vocational universities will grow in popularity and traditional ones may face a threat.
Because of the lack of operation experience by Chinese private universities, such as in the fields of college financing and incentive funding measures, compared with Western countries, the best way for some private universities would be to figure out a special course with distinct features in the educational market, and if not, as Gu said, [what is left for them is nothing but to close down.
US Senator Charles Schumer said on Wednesday he and other colleagues would push for a vote in the next two weeks on legislation that would allow the US Commerce Department to use anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws against China or any other country with a fundamentally misaligned exchange rate.

Beijing's move should be seen as justifiable because China's economy is now very strong and expanding steadily with the current account balance enjoying a substantial surplus, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand (BoT) Bandid Nijathaworn said, quoted by TNA.
If all currencies in the region strengthen simultaneously, concerns over the pros and cons of the baht's appreciation or depreciation against other currencies could be ruled out, he said.
It meant, the deputy governor said, Thailand would not lose its export competitiveness in terms of currency value because currencies of the country's rivals had also appreciated in the same direction as the baht.
In contrast, entrepreneurs in other Asian countries including Thailand, and major industrialized countries will benefit from the RMB's flexibility because they could export more goods to China, helping ease the trade imbalance with China in the long run, he said.

Tax cuts may be proposed to be applied in certain highly competitive industries to help bring employee wages up,  the First Financial Daily reported on Wednesday.

The government's new regulation policies have an obvious effect on curbing speculation in cities where property prices are going up too fast, and China's property market will enter a long wait-and-see period as the new policies take effect, an analyst said.
South Korean steelmaker Posco, together with Korea Resources Corp, acquired a controlling stake in a Chinese rare earth mining company.
Analysts say this might be a strategy to bypass China's restriction on rare earth exports, National Business Daily reported on Friday.
Posco and Korea Resources bought 60 percent of Yongxin Rare Earth Metal Co, a company in Inner Mongolia autonomous region, for 59.
76 million yuan ($8. 8 million).
The deal enables Posco to buy rare earth export quotas from other companies and export rare earth back to South Korea, said Geng Nuo, an analyst with Great Wall Securities.
Only about one-fifth of rare earth mining companies in China have export quotas.
Rare earth contains elements which are indispensible in many high-tech arenas such as wind turbines and hybrid cars.
China supplies 93 percent of the global production of rare earth elements.
South Korea has been encouraging its wind power industry, which needs elements contained in rare earth.
Recently China has tightened controls on the rare earth industry.
Feeling the pressure of decreased supplies, many foreign companies came up with contrivances to get around export restrictions.
Besides buying quotas, some companies set up processing plants in China, on which export restrictions are comparatively looser, and export processed rare earth products from them, .
BEIJING: China's curbing of exports of some raw materials to protect the environment and reduce its trade surplus is in line with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, experts say.
In its biennial review of China's trade policies, the WTO alleged Monday China may be giving its manufacturers an unfair advantage by restricting exports of some raw materials.
China uses restrictions such as prohibition, licensing, quotas and partial tax rebates to manage exports of certain resources so as to conserve resources and energy, the WTO report said.
The WTO report only considered the importers' views and has no legal force, Tu said.
The US and the EU have restrictions on exports, too, said Lei Yanhua, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce.
It is absurd for the US and the EU to press China on environmental protection standards while criticizing China for restricting exports of energy-intensive and highly polluting resources and products, he said.
Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday urged the government to optimize credit structure and maintain a proper pace of credit supply to guard against financial risks.
China's top banking regulator Liu Mingkang told the Asia Financial Forum held in Hong Kong Wednesday that China's overall credit growth will be scaled down to 7.

The rising price of food and summer grain crops will not greatly influence the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Securities Daily reported.
The overall output of summer grain crops has reached 123 million tons in 2010, 350, 000 tons less than last year, which has fuelled speculation the price will rise.
The expectation of a rise in the price of summer grain crops, the main component of food prices, leads to some anxiety over adding pressure to inflation.
Although the purchasing price of the crops rises, it may not have an obvious influence on the CPI,  as the food, which includes crops, only accounts for 33 percent of all products which are taken into count by the index.

BEIJING: Global manufacturers struggling with life-or-death pressures to control costs are finding that the legions of low-wage Chinese workers they rely on have limits.
Analysts at the All-China Federation of Labor in Beijing said recent labor disputes indicated that it was vital to increase wages and adopt better working conditions for laborers.
Since May 1, the minimum wage in Guangzhou had increased by 20 percent and from July 1, the minimum wage in Shenzhen would be increased by 10 percent.
Luo Mingzhong, a professor at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, said that in the Pearl River Delta, most laborers in the manufacturing industry worked at least 10 hours a day and had to work overtime to earn a monthly salary of 1, 800 yuan ($263. 63).
49 percent to 39.
74 percent, which means laborers' incomes haven't risen with the economy during the past two decades.
The paper said the processing trade accounted for 50 percent of the country's total trade volume.
But, in the global production chain, the revenue rate generated from the processing trade was as low as 5 percent.
Luo said the era of cheap labor in manufacturers in China had come to an end and the manufacturing industry should shift from relying on low labor cost to relying on research, development and self-branding.
BEIJING: Multinational firms are expected to increase procurement value by 30 percent in Shanghai this year, thanks to the recovering economy and their expansion plans in China, a United States-based business-to-business media firm said Tuesday.
In 2010, multinationals, including Wal-Mart, Honeywell and Dell, will spend $50 billion on procurement in Shanghai, an annual increase of 30 percent, according to Global Sources.

Asian consumer electronics markets, led by China, will account for 36 percent of the global market next year from 34 percent now, according to the US Consumer Electronics Association.
More than 3, 000 Chinese retailers, including Bailian Group, Trust-Mart and Wangfujing Store, have set up procurement offices in Shanghai, Global Sources said.

CANBERRA: Australian consumers have been showing some resilience to rising interest rates, forking out over A$20.
1 billion ($16. 85 billion) at the shops in April, new data showed on Tuesday.
Retail spending rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.
6 percent in April following an upward revision to 0.
8 percent growth in March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.
The data came just hours before the Reserve Bank of Australia was due announcing its latest decision on interest rates following a monthly board meeting.
Recent upheavals in global financial markets were another reason to sit tight on rates this time around, they said.

7 percent in the first-tier zone in Hainan.
The increase rate in Anhui was 25.
9 percent, Yunnan 22 percent, Hunan 27.
8 percent, Henan 23 percent.
He added that enterprises should enjoy more preferential polices from the government, like deduction of taxes, to deal with pressures from the minimum wage rise.

Floor space transactions in the 35 cities monitored by China Index Academy went up last week (June 21 -27), the Shanghai Securities News reported Tuesday, citing a weekly report from the academy.
Among the 35 cities, Ningbo of Zhejiang province witnessed the most robust growth in floor space transactions, with a 231.
18 percent weekly jump.
It also said that 49 land plots measuring 2.
42 million square meters were sold last week, with the average price going up 17 percent week-on-week to 4, 399 yuan ($647. 96) per square meter.
The price of housing is expected to fall in the third quarter as measures taken to regulate the property market take hold.
Experts believe the decline in property sales will put pressure on developers to reduce prices beginning in July, especially in China's main cities.
The volatile market forced most buyers to cancel or postpone their purchases with the trading volume halved in May, according to statistics from China Index Academy.
The market witnessed an average decline of 44 percent with Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Nanjing and Hangzhou dropping to an historical low.
In 30 cities across China many developers witnessed no sales in May, which economists have attributed to prudent buyers.
Under pressure, some leading property giants have seen a slight improvement in sales after lowering prices, which insiders speculate will become a trend across the nation.
One analyst with Midland Realty believes the decline is part of a stepwise process which will see prices tumble in the third quarter.
The SNG project based in Qitai county of Xinjiang will turn coal from the Dajing mining area in the East Junggar coalfields into natural gas which will be transported to energy-hungry regions outside of Xinjiang, China Huaneng Group said.
The gas sales will generate 7 billion yuan in annual revenue and 2.
5 billion yuan in annual profits and taxes, the company said.
Zhang Tingke, deputy president of China Huaneng Group, said the SNG project, the biggest of the kind in the region, will be environmentally-friendly and energy-conserving.

The second blow that the central government dealt to the red-hot property market has come much sooner than expected.
Just two days after it decided to lift down payments and second-home loan rates, the State Council announced on Saturday that commercial banks can refuse to issue loans to third-home buyers in cities where housing prices are rising too quickly.
Such continuous, heavy moves are meant to drive home the message that the government is very serious about reining in runaway property price hikes.
The worst global economic crisis in decades that broke out in late 2008 has understandably prompted Chinese policymakers to take a much more accommodating stance toward real estate investment, a major contributor to economic growth.
The Chinese economy has rebounded so strongly out of the global recession that it registered an 11.
9-percent gross domestic product growth in the first quarter, the fastest expansion in nearly three years.
It is high time for policymakers to carefully weigh the risks of property bubbles against the growth momentum that a dynamic property market provides for the national economy.
The latest efforts to cool the property market shows the authorities have fully recognized both the danger of a looming property bubble and, more importantly, the huge cost of not pricking it in time.
But more efforts are needed to keep various speculators at bay, to ensure the sector's healthy development.
Tianjin began its week-long culture show at the World Expo 2010 yesterday with a display of many of its folk arts.

The MOF will provide subsidies to provincial and municipal government finance bureaus for promotion of such vehicles, the statement released by the MOF said.
Local governments will have to apply for the funding based on a promotion plan.
The statement did not elaborate on the total amount of funding or a time frame for the program.
China on Tuesday released details of its green-car subsidy program that is designed to boost the nation's auto industry and cut vehicle emissions.

BEIJING - China's trade surplus would likely fall noticeably this year as exports outlook would not be optimistic while imports would remain robust, Ministry of Commerce spokesman Yao Jian said at a briefing Saturday.
Exports growth would slow after July, Yao forecast, adding the surge in exports in May was due to a low comparison basis last year.
5 percent year-on-year, customs data released Thursday.
Yao attributed the weak export outlook to the European sovereign debt crisis, rising commodity prices and labor costs.
China would maintain stable trade policies amid the crisis, and might adjust some policies in some specific industries for environmental protection purposes.
Yao also told reporters that attempts by some US lawmakers to include China's exchange rate policy into trade investigations on China's exports of aluminum extrusions and coated paper lacked factual support and did not conform to rules of the World Trade Organization.
The WTO regulated trade policies instead of a country's overall financial or foreign exchange policies, he said.
QINGDAO - Robust growth of the private sector has made it China's major new jobs provider, contributing 90 percent of new positions, Minister of State Administration for Industry and Commerce Zhou Bohua said on Thursday.
At the end of the first quarter, private firms employed more than 152 million people, Zhou said in Qingdao, a seaside resort in east China's Shandong province, at a forum to boost development in the private sector.
Vice Minister Zhong Youping said the country had 7.
55 million private companies at the end of March, up almost 14 percent year-on-year, with total registered capital exceeding 15 trillion yuan ($2. 2 trillion), up 26.
9 percent.
The private companies employed 86.
98 million people at the same period, up 11.
19 percent year-on-year.
Zhong said individually-run businesses rose by 9.
56 percent to 32.
29 million by the end of March, employing 65.
36 million people, up 12.
51 percent.
Zhong urged local industry and commerce bureaus to continue their support for the private sector, following the central government's support plan unveiled in May to boost development in the private sector.
This included improving financing services, easier market access to more industries currently mainly state-controlled, and simplifying administrative procedures.
Zhong said local bureaus should carry out these policies and encourage private companies to have more involvement in high-tech industries, infrastructure building, environmental protection.
The last of China's big four State-owned banks to go public, AgBank is selling 25.

Agricultural Bank of China, the country's No 3 bank by assets, is set to price its dual Hong Kong and Shanghai IPO late on Tuesday, determining whether it will become world's largest ever share offer.
AgBank's pricing will also provide a barometer of sentiment for other Chinese banks planning to raise billions of dollars more from investors worried about slowing growth, rising bad loans and tanking global stock markets.
China's benchmark stock index has lost nearly a quarter of its value since mid-April and fell sharply last week, partly due to investors selling stocks to raise money for the AgBank offer.
Mark To, Head of Research at Wing Fung Financial Group, said he believes that money will flow back into Chinese shares once AgBank lists, particularly toward mainland banks and property developers.

Lenovo entered the smartphone market with a thin, touchscreen device based on Google Inc's Android operating system, which it debuted at the Consumer Electronics Shows in January.
In doing so, it joined a growing cast of traditional handset makers such as Dell and Acer using the Google platform as they seek new opportunities in smartphones.
Lenovo previously said its China sales jumped 41 percent in October-December as it and its peers benefited from China's 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) stimulus spending package, partly aimed at encouraging the public sector and rural consumers to buy more electronic products.
A rising profit margin in the final 2009 quarter helped Lenovo post net profit of $79.

Sun Zhongjie, from Henan province, is overcome with emotion in Shanghai after hearing that the authorities had cleared his name following a high-profile accusation that he was the operator of an illegal taxi, in Shanghai, October 26, 2009.
Sun cut off his finger to demonstrate his innocence in October last year after he was accused of operating an unlicensed taxi by the local traffic police in Pudong district in Shanghai.
A series of official investigations were then set off looking into the validity of the practice of entrapment.
Sun cleared his name later that month when the district government apologized to him and admitted the illegal entrapment.
The case exposed controversial police tactics to ensnare unlicensed taxi drivers.

Liu Tienan, deputy minister of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said the electricity supply in Northeast and Northwest China would be adequate, while electric supplies in the more developed East, South and North China would be rather tight.
China still faces grim conditions due to planned reductions in factory emissions, while the supply of coal used to generate electricity, along with unpredictable weather conditions, pose uncertainties to the power supply, Liu added.
He asked local authorities to ensure electricity remains available for people's homes, while placing a cap on the power used by power-guzzling industries.
Hospitals, schools and service industries, as well as those with low energy consumption, currently enjoy priority use of electricity.
Further, electricity should be guaranteed for the Shanghai World Expo and within the Yushu region in Northwest China which was hard hit by a 7.
1-magnitude earthquake in April.
Summer electricity supplies are an annual test for China's power generating system.
Also, the situation has become more complicated in recent years as the supply of power coal, which generates 70 percent of the nation's electricity, fluctuates due to restructuring which occurs within the nation's major coal mines.
PetroChina Co, the nation's largest oil and gas producer, plans to build gasoline and diesel hydrotreaters at its Lanzhou refinery in northwestern China to produce cleaner fuels.

But exports of solar cell products still doubled during the first quarter of this year.
Standard Chartered said a takeover of BP by PetroChina would transform China's biggest oil and gas producer from a low-growth company into a global oil champion and boost its earnings per share significantly.
There was also no overlap in assets and PetroChina would pay less than $7 per boe (barrels of oil equivalent) for BP's reserves, which was seen as cost-effective, the bank said, adding that, in addition, BP's output would hedge a third of China's oil imports.
All these incentives would eventually make it an attractive exit opportunity for BP's shareholders, it said.
A combined PetroChina-BP would have oil and gas reserves that were 73 percent and 187 percent larger, respectively, than ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Standard Chartered said.
Standard Chartered also highlighted some uncertainties in its note.

She said the electricity volume generated by hydro power plants might be affected by the current drought that rage southwest China while a 15 percent price hikes of thermal coal would add to the tension between coal producer and thermal power plants, which depend on burning thermal coal to generate electricity.
Limited railway transport capacity will also impair the supply of thermal coal in central and southwest China, she added.
The CEC estimated the country's electricity consumption growth will slow down in the coming months due to the varying bases of last year.

BRUSSELS: Two Chinese dairy producers, Mengniu and Yili, entered the world's top 20 dairy ranking last year, according to an annual report released on Wednesday.
Mengniu, with a turnover of $3.
77 billion in 2009, ranked the 16th in the top-20 list, Dutch financial group Rabobank said in the report.
Yili, a main rival of Mengniu, was a newcomer in the list.
With an annual turnover of $3.
54 billion last year, it ranked the 17th.
Among the top 20 dairy companies, Nestle of Switzerland remained the global leader, recording an annual turnover of $25.
9 billion last year, nearly two times that of France's Danone, the world's No 2.
With the exception of two Chinese dairy producers, the top-20 list was predominantly occupied by western companies.
However, the main conclusion of the 2009 ranking is that the number of representatives of non-western countries is steadily increasing, thanks to rising domestic demand in the developing world, Rabobank said.
Such a high-profile commitment to higher wages is certainly an overdue salute to the hundreds of millions of workers in the country who have made significant efforts to help build a well-off society in an all-round way.
There is also a far-reaching significance of raising incomes for laborers: It is the only way for China to effectively boost domestic consumption to pursue sustainable economic growth.
But the rise of their wages is too slow compared with the expansion of national wealth.
As a result, consumption has actually fallen as a share of GDP in recent years.
The global economic crisis since late 2008 has made it clear that China can no longer rely excessively on investment and export for growth.
China must embrace consumer-led growth to address both domestic and global economic imbalance.
BEIJING - The yuan appreciation is likely to have a negative impact on the steel industry in the short term despite lowering the import costs for iron ore, industry experts said on Tuesday.
However, from an export point of view, a 3 percent increase in the yuan and the removal of the 9 percent and 13 percent rebates on hot-rolled coil and cold rolled coil will reduce the competitiveness of Chinese steel products in the global market, said Zhang.
China exported 24.
6 million tons of steel products last year.
Exports of Chinese steel products surged by 17.

GENEVA -- The World Health Organization says an annual food safety meeting July 5-9 will discuss setting a global limit on how much melamine is allowed in food and animal feed.
Melamine contamination in milk products has been blamed for the sickening of nearly 300, 000 babies and deaths of at least six infants in China in recent years.
WHO said Thursday that some 130 countries meeting in Geneva may limit the amount of melamine to 2.
5 milligrams per kilogram with certain exceptions.
The threshold for infant milk formula would be set at 1 milligram per kilogram.
That is equivalent to the current US limit of 1 part per million.
The limit won't be legally binding but countries can refuse to allow the import of products deemed below minimum quality.

Zhongwang is China's largest exporter to the United States of aluminum extrusions, which are widely used in window frames and automotive parts.
Its sales to the US reached 5 billion yuan last year.
The US International Trade Commission in May approved a US Commerce Department investigation that there was enough evidence to show aluminum extrusions imported from China had harmed the domestic industry, leading to a further probe into aluminum goods made in China.
The Commerce Department started its investigation in April after receiving a petition from the United Steel Union and the Aluminum Extrusion Fair Trade Committee complaining of unfair Chinese practices in the form of Chinese government subsidies to its exporters.
The department is scheduled to make a preliminary countervailing determination in June and an anti-dumping determination in September.
The US investigation follows a similar move by the European Union and Australia, which imposed an anti-dumping duty of as high as 30 percent on aluminum foil and 16 percent on aluminum extrusions from China last July and November.
According to the US government, imports of aluminum extrusion from China rose 90 percent from 2007 to 2009 and were valued at $514 million.
Many domestic aluminum firms said the anti-dumping duties imposed on them would be more than 10 percent if the US finally approves the case.

The Shuijiahu, Changfeng Station will be located 300m north of the old station, where the county's timber company previously lay.
The new station occupies an area of 4, 000 sq m, leaving plenty of room for possible future connections with Shangqiu-Hangzhou passenger dedicated lines.
Changfeng county is planning to build a residential community on the south of Changxin Road and east of South Changhuai Road for the resettlement caused by the relocation of the station.
The bidding has finished and the construction is about to set out.

The inbound payment-by-buyers express market will draw more attention when the yuan appreciation boosts Chinese demand for import goods?
said Li Jian, manager of A. T. Kearney China, which recently published the China Transportation and Logistics Industry Outlook (2010-2015).
Chinese companies seem not as prepared as their foreign peers, as they seldom do sales promotions, Li added.
Du Jinfu\nThe Chinese central bank named Du Jinfu as deputy governor last month, according to an undated posting on the People's Bank of China website.
Du, 55, was promoted to assistant governor in June 2006, after heading the central bank's statistics and personnel departments, according to the website.
He joined the central bank in 1992 as head of research at the Inner Mongolia branch of the People's Bank of China.
Deputy Governor Su Ning was no longer listed on the website as one of the central bank's nine top officials.
Su may be appointed chairman of China UnionPay Data Co, Caijing magazine reported May 19 on its website, citing people it didn't identify.
He said the PBOC would also support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in Xinjiang.
Chinese exporters and importers in five cities -- Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Dongguan -- are already allowed to settle cross-border trade deals in yuan.
A PBOC report said last month that the country needs to expand yuan cross-border settlement when conditions allow.
A program for cross-border yuan settlement, which has been piloted in five Chinese cities since mid-2009, will be expanded as the volume in cross-border trade settled in yuan neared 50 billion yuan ($7. 3 billion) by mid-May, the 21st Century Business Herald reported Thursday.
According to the central bank and five related ministries, the State Council has approved a plan to add nine other provinces -- Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Hainan, Sichuan and Yunnan; two autonomous regions -- Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang; and three other municipalities -- Beijing, Tianjin and Chongqing.
China's currency is probably overvalued, not undervalued as Washington complains, a state-run Chinese newspaper said on Thursday, advancing Beijing's push against US demands to loosen up the yuan.
China has come under renewed pressure from Washington to free up controls on the yuan's exchange rate, which many in the US Congress contend is grossly undervalued, unfairly squeezing out competition against cheaper Chinese goods.
8 percent since 1994, when the government brought in a single yuan currency, wrote Xie.
Until then, China operated a separate system of yuan specifically for foreign exchange and use by foreigners.
Over the same time, Xie wrote, China's inexpensive exports helped to hold down inflationary pressures in the United States.
Beijing is facing international calls to let the yuan resume rising after effectively repegging the currency at about 6.
83 to the dollar to help its exporters ride out the global credit crunch.

The Kuwait Investment Authority intends to invest about $1 billion to become a cornerstone investor in the Chinese bank's $30 billion IPO, which would be the world's largest, the newspaper reported, quoting a source at one of the underwriters.

NEW ORLEANS - Out-of-work Gulf Coast shrimper Todd Pellegal spent his first $2, 500 check from BP quickly, paying off bills and buying groceries for his family.
He never even considered putting some of it away for taxes.
Now he's among the people up and down the Gulf Coast reeling from the oil spill disaster who are surprised - and frustrated - to find out the Internal Revenue Service may take a chunk of the payments BP PLC is providing to help them stay afloat.
Many were already angry about how long the oil giant took to cut the checks.
So when they got the money - generally about a few thousand dollars each so far - they spent it fast.
Accountants have been trying to nail down the implications for thousands of taxpayers after President Barack Obama said BP would create a $20-billion disaster fund and provide another $100 million for oil workers who lost their jobs because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
It's not the first time the region has dealt with whether disaster money should be taxed.

The report said local police were confronting a machete-armed man and that Luo was watching the scene from the fifth floor of a nearby building.
Police had been called to the scene after brawls broke out near a local nightclub.
Nine drunken young men, including one armed with a machete, attacked the officers when they arrived, the Fengshan county publicity department said in a statement.
In response, police fired warning shots into the air to stop the man armed with a machete and one of the bullets hit Luo, the statement said.
It said Luo was sent to a hospital for emergency treatment, but did not reveal how officers found him.
According to the statement, Luo was pronounced dead at the hospital on Saturday morning.
The nine young men, with one identified only by his surname Peng, have been summoned to the local police department.
Calls to the government went unanswered on Sunday.

03 in 2009 but those in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Shenzhen were over 14.
In addition, the relationship between the house selling price index and the cost of renting index is widening at an accelerated pace, as is the sale price versus cost of construction ratio, according to Yao's research.
Property prices in 70 cities rose in April by an average of 12.
8 percent from a year earlier, higher than the annual 11.
7 percent increase in March and the fastest pace since the National Bureau of Statistics began to compile monthly figures in July 2005.
The government needs to address the problem from both sides, and a slew of measures introduced in recent months, including raising down payments and mortgage rates for second homes, will likely have a bigger impact on in coming months, he said.
Yao suggested the government make real efforts to build more public housing, guide developers to build more small houses, and start collecting property taxes.

A Chinese supercomputer has ascended to the second place in the world in terms of speed, according to the New York Times.
The Dawning Nebulae of the Shenzhen-based National Supercomputing Center has reached a sustained computing speed of 1.
27 petaflops, which equals to one thousand trillion mathematical operations a second - according to the latest semiannual ranking of the world's fastest 500 computers.
The latest ranking was released on Monday at the International Supercomputer Conference in Hamburg, Germany.
Supercomputers are designed to solve complex scientific and engineering problems.
The Dawning Nebulae is in fact now ranked as the world's fastest in terms of theoretical peak performance, but that is considered a less important measure than the actual computing speed achieved on a standardized computing test.
Previously, a supercomputer at the Tianjin-based National Supercomputing Center gained the best-ever ranking, the fifth, but now it is at the seventh place.

GUANGZHOU: Railway police from south China's Guangdong Province have detained two people for scalping real-name train tickets, the first such arrests since the launch of a scheme to sell tickets based on proven IDs, Yao Mai, director of Guangzhou Railway Police said Wednesday.
The pilot scheme began in south China on January 21 to prevent ticket hoarding by scalpers during the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year travel peak.
Police arrived at the agency on Sunday in Zhongshan City of Guangdong Province and seized 35 tickets with a total face value of 5, 700 yuan(US$834), 47 IDs, and about 10 books of ticket-selling documents.
The illegal ticket-selling agency was closed Sunday by police a week after it started scalping, said Yao.
The real-name system was initially adopted on trains between Guangdong, home to millions of migrants workers seeking to return home for the Spring Festival holiday, and inland provinces of Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou and Chongqing Municipality.

Before, workers took action only when their legal rights were violated, he explained, but the new generation of migrant workers has been emboldened by tight legislation, such as the Labor Contract Law, which offer more job security.

Then, few would have been able to afford to buy the cars they helped make.
But after more than a decade of collective bargaining, their wages have risen dramatically.
To make it happen, he added, workers needed good representation and an effective mechanism for collective bargaining.

104 Warring States Period-Han Dynasty tombs unearthed in Hebei province.
(photo by Li Jun/Huang Tao)
And in the process of excavation, the 2 kiln sites and 104 ancient tombs were unearthed.
The 2 kiln sites are preserved very well, complete with kiln fired ceramic tiles and a large amount of broken terracotta as well as some basins and pots.
This is the first time of terracotta kilns have been found in Xingtai, and they provide rich material for research on local buildings during the Han Dynasty.
20 of 104 ancient tombs belonged to the late Warring States Period, and others belonged to early of Han Dynasty.
Judging from the method of burial, we can tell that Qin people had started their life since Warring States Period.
In addition, the items unearthed from these tombs could play an important role in the research of local culture as well as the changing history of funerals from Warring States Period to the Han Dynasty.
Archaeology is a scientific study of ancient society by excavation and survey through the remains of ancient human relics.
And Archaeology is the major path for modern people to approach their ancient ancestors, especially for those living in the Daming Palace which now turned into ruins.
If the Daming Palace can be described as an elder older than 1, 000 years old, the archaeological study of Daming Palace should be a vibrant youth as only after the founding of new China in 1949, the first archaeological team was dispatched to the Daming Palace area.
Dozens of groups of young archaeologists have devoted their heart, energy and youth to this land and have driven the Daming Palace ruins which has been in dormancy for more than a thousand years back to life.
From figure out the size of the Daming Palace, to draw the first survey map of the palace, and from focusing on excavation of the main hall – Hanyuan Hall, to shifting the archaeological goal to site preservation and protection gradually, archeology has helped people in the modern world understand and rediscover the Daming Palace more and more clearly.
Although we cannot remember the name of each archaeologist, history will never forget their deed.
Truth is the very prerequisite for a solu- tion to the death of 11 tigers in more than three months at a zoo in Shenyang in the Northeast.
Who is responsible for the management of the non-State-owned zoo?
Why is the annual revenue of 12-14 million yuan from sales of tickets - aside from the subsidies from the local government - not enough to provide for the more than 1, 000 animals?
Where has the money gone?
In the past 11 years since the zoo was established on the basis of the city's State-owned zoo, the total number of animals has been reduced from more than 1, 000 in 61 species to more than 500 in 41 species.
More than 100 workers have been on strike for a week asking for their defaulted payment.
Rumors have it that the zoo intentionally starved the tigers to death to put pressure on the local government for more money.
If it is true, the decision-makers should be arrested for the crimes of killing endangered wild animals.
Yet none of the leaders of the zoo has said a word.
If it's true that the local government has poured money into the poorly managed zoo over the past decade, local taxpayers have enough reason to ask whether any corruption was behind the restructuring of the zoo and if any official received any kickbacks by supporting it in the past decade.
It should not be difficult for the current investigation to find out the whole truth unless there has been some deliberate cover-up.
The local government won't be able to plan for the future of this zoo and of the wild animals if the problems with the current management are not resolved.
China plans to restructure shanty towns in the country and clear up idle land to increase land supply, in the latest efforts to add more affordable housing for low-income families, government officials said yesterday.
The move is part of the government's real estate package to curb soaring property prices and crack down on speculation.
Currently, there are more than 10 million families living in shanty towns in the country.
To finance this transformation, the Ministry of Finance will also offer a number of favorable policies, such as the exemption of land use fees, stamp tax and contract tax, according to Wang Bao'an, assistant minister of the Ministry of Finance.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Land and Resources will also quicken the process of clearing up idle land.
By the end of last year, about 10, 000 hectare lands was left unused.
Yu Xiaosu, vice-minister of land and resources, promised to let these parcels of land enter the market this month.
These measures, according to Qin Xiaomei, chief researcher with Jones Lang LaSalle Beijing, will definitely help stabilize property prices.
Nie Meisheng, director of China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce, held a similar view.

BEIJING - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has pledged to further reform of income distribution to narrow the gap between rich and poor and secure social stability.
Complaints have been growing about how the income growth of many Chinese was lagging behind the rise in state fiscal revenue.
Low incomes have been blamed for dragging down consumer spending.
He pledged the government would gradually increase the proportion of income individuals received from the distribution of national income, as well as the proportion of the primary distribution of income that went to wages and salaries.
The role of taxation policies in adjusting the distribution of income should be strengthened, and the tax burden for low and medium-income people should be alleviated.
He said the government would deepen the reform of income distribution system of monopoly industries, and set strict standards for the income of executives, especially senior ranks, in state-owned enterprises and financial institutions.
Wen also vowed to crack down on and ban illegal income, regulate off-the-books income, gradually form a transparent, fair and rational pattern of income distribution, and resolutely reverse the widening income gap.
He promised to guarantee a minimal living standard for low-income people in urban and rural areas and continue the government's poverty alleviation programs in the countryside.

Since 2004, the gang organized more than 100 women and some young men to engage in sex trade in Chongqing.
The prosecutors alleged that between May 2004 and 2009, Wang also offered bribes well over 1.
28 million yuan to five government employees, including Wen Qiang, formerly chief of Chongqing municipal bureau of justice, and Li Hanbin, a former police chief of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Public Security who was assigned to crack down on organized crimes.

Police detained the mine's owner, but did not disclose the owner's name.
Hundreds of tonnes of coal, which had jammed the shaft, would take two to three days to clear, and the gas concentration was quite high, which hindered the rescue operation, he said.

On March 11, the Ministry of Land and Resources issued a directive, saying that developers must take a 50-percent downpayment on all land put up for auction within one month after signing a contract, or they will lose the land along with their deposit.
On March 23, the Ministry of Land and Resources suspended transactions of land for residential use until a nationwide land-use plan was crafted on April 15.
On April 14, the central government raised the required downpayment for a family purchasing a second house from the 40 percent to 50 percent.
On April 17, the State Council asked related departments and local governments to take strict measures to curb speculative property purchases and to increase residential housing supplies.
It also said banks can refuse loans to people buying their third houses in areas suffering from soaring property prices.
GUILIN - A freak spring flood has killed two people and forced 8, 872 to flee their homes in a southern Chinese city, local authorities said Thursday.
Torrential rain, which fell from Monday to Thursday, also led to the collapse of 1, 275 houses in Guilin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to the flood control and drought relief headquarters in Guilin.
The two dead, Jiang Jiayou and Tang Jiyu, were from Quanzhou County, Guilin Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau said in a statement.
Jiang, 76, was checking his old home, where no one lived, Tuesday and was crushed to death when the house collapsed.
Tang, 46, drowned in flash flood while trying to remove his belongings from his house at 2 a. m. Tuesday, it said.
Shipping on the Lijiang River was halted after its water level rose to 147.
1 meters, 1.
4 meters above the warning level.
The flood, the earliest on record, caused direct economic losses of 68 million yuan ($10 million).
Floods usually come in May and June, according to local meteorological authorities.
The government pledged to make budgets transparent and they kept that promise with the publication of ministry-level department budgets this week.
But the budgets, detailing how public funds are spent, were just the beginning.
A few days after the Ministry of Finance published 12 central government budgetary reports, four ministry-level departments released their own budgets.
These departmental budgets provide the public with general information about how ministries generate revenue and how public funds are and will be spent.
This budgetary information is needed for taxpayers to understand where their money will go.
But the current efforts to enhance transparency means more than just guaranteeing the public's right to know.
The goal is to increase public oversight and hence help raise efficiency in government expenditures.
In view of this goal, every budgetary report thus far is unfortunately not informative enough for the public to get a clear picture of how government revenues are spent.
Budgetary clarity is crucial to make sure officials and their departments are accountable.
A case in point is Shanghai.
The city recently bought a number of BMW cars for city employees to use during work.
Locals certainly deserve a clear-cut budgetary explanation about how much the cars cost and what are the justifications for the purchases.
Though governments at all levels have gradually realized the need to reveal the budgets, the more important task is to ensure that budgetary transparency will lead to budget accountability.
A notice outlining new, intensified measures to prevent and control hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) was released by Shandong`s Health Bureau on April 12th.

XI'AN: Air services between Zhengzhou and Xi'an, two Chinese provincial capital cities, were suspended on Thursday, 48 days after a high-speed railway line started operation between the two destinations.
The 505-km railway with a speed of 350 km per hour was the first high-speed rail line in central and western China.
It cut the travel time between the two cities from more than six hours to less than two hours.
The air trip alone takes 70 minutes, but the travel from downtowns to the two airports also cost time, he said.
A total of seven two-way trains everyday on the line can basically meet the demand, he said.
Pang Chong, a sales manager with the Shandong Airline, said Chinese airliners should avoid opening air routes where high-speed railway lines were opened or planned, when exploring regional air market.
China will complete a high-speed railway network with a total length of 13, 000 km by 2012, according to a plan of the Ministry of Railways.
YICHUAN, Henan: The death toll in a central China mine blast last week has risen to 28 and about 16 people were believed still trapped underground, local authorities said on Monday.
Rescuers found the bodies of eight trapped miners on Sunday, said a spokesman with the rescue headquarters.
Investigations so far showed that the blast killed 23 miners underground and five on the surface.
Another two on the surface were injured.
Sixteen people were still trapped underground, the spokesman said.
More than 500 rescuers were searching for the trapped miners, he said.
About 90 miners were working underground when the gas explosion occurred at 7: 20 p. m. on March 31 in a coal pit privately owned by Guomin Mining Co. , Ltd. , in Yichuan County, Luoyang City in Henan Province.
The rescue headquarters said 51 miners survived the explosion.
Of them, 31 were saved by rescuers and 20 others escaped by themselves.
Work safety authorities ordered the mine to suspend operations after a gas outburst on May 1, 2009, and production after that date was illegal, said a statement from the Henan Administration of Work Safety.
The coal mine was under technological renovation and was designed to have an annual production capacity of 150, 000 tonnes.
Yichuan County Chief Wu Ligang and three other county officials have been removed from their posts since the accident.
Still, the problems a recent online article highlights are worthy of serious consideration by policymakers.
By comparing the curve of Japan's home prices between 1985-1991 with China's property prices between 2005-2008, the article predicted that China's property prices will likely plunge next year.
However, as many experts quickly and rightly pointed out, the simplified comparison in the online article is worthless given the two countries' vast differences in stages of development, demographic and geographic features, urbanization ratio as well as other conditions or issues pertaining to each nation.
More ironically, instead of giving an accurate prediction, the article may actually postpone the inevitable correction of the overheated property market by saving a number of people from becoming the last straw.
They have ample reasons to be cautious against repeating the mistakes of the Japanese real estate bubble.
NANJING - Seven people were killed and one injured Friday morning after a workshop ceiling collapsed in east China's Jiangsu Province, local authorities said Saturday.

BEIJING: Chinese police have freed 3, 455 children and 7, 365 women in nearly nine months since a campaign against human trafficking was launched in early April last year, an official from the Ministry of Public Security said Friday.
He said so far 19 out of 20 suspects on the ministry's most-wanted list of serious abduction crimes had been arrested.

A special group should be set up to handle each child abduction case, and the group would not be dismissed until the case was cracked, he said.
Police would also speed up the building of a DNA database to combat child trafficking, Huang noted.
The database would include DNA from the parents of abducted children and DNA from the children who were suspected of having been abducted or vagrant children whose history was unclear, he said.

He was sentenced to seven years in jail in December 2008 at the Huai'an Municipal Intermediate People's Court, and was fined 3, 000 yuan (US$441).

A Chinese mainland spokesman said Wednesday that the economic pact under discussion with Taiwan will follow the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
However, since the talks had just begun, it was too early to talk about the details of interaction with the WTO, said Yang Yi, spokesman with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, at a regular press conference in Beijing in response to a question whether the mainland will report the pact to the WTO after it is signed.
Experts from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan held their first talks in Beijing Tuesday to pave the way for the long-awaited Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA).
According to Taiwan-based news channel TVBS, Taiwan expected to reach the pact in the first half of this year.
When asked to comment on Taiwan's argument that it should not lift restrictions on mainland laborers and farm produce trade in the pact, Yang said the two sides will follow the principles of equality, mutual benefit and openness during the talks.
The ECFA is intended to make systematic arrangements to normalize mainland-Taiwan economic ties and bring the economies of both sides closer.
Experts from the two sides would hold the second meeting as early as possible, Yang said.
The biopic of the life of the ancient Chinese philosopher and educator Confucius starring Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat is set to premiere on Jan 22.
The latter, which was made to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), was released with 1, 450 prints in September.
Chow said in an early interview that he had taken the role because in the film Confucius was portrayed as a man with much human interest.
The film, which cost about 150 million yuan (about 21. 9 million U. S. dollars) to make, focuses on the great philosopher's life experiences from 51 to 73.
Confucius (551 BC--479 BC) was born in the ancient Chinese state of Lu, today's Qufu city in Shandong province.
He was a great educator, philosopher, a renowned politician and the founding father of Confucianism.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong police will soon charge a man for perpetrating a recent acid attack in a busy Hong Kong shopping district, the first potential breakthrough after a spate of city-wide acid attack cases over the past year or so.
Police said they now had enough evidence to prove the 23-year-old suspect was responsible for an acid attack last month in a bustling street in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong island.
Hong Kong enjoys a reputation as one of Asia's safest cities, but the bizarre spate of acid attacks has put increasing pressure on local police to make a breakthrough after an extended stalemate and growing cash rewards for tipoffs.
Calls have also mounted for more surveillance cameras to be installed in high-risk areas.
Yu added that the man had likely acted alone in the attack, but his motive remained unclear.
It wasn't immediately clear whether the suspect may have also masterminded a spate of other acid attacks that have targeted pedestrians in numerous districts and residential estates.
Police, however, had previously indicated this possibility.
There have been at least eight acid attacks in Hong Kong since late 2008, injuring more than 100 people, most with chemical burns.
None of the injuries resulted in death.
The latest attack took place in the Temple Street night market last weekend, injuring 30 people including nine tourists.

BEIJING: Another strong cold wave is expected to hit China's central, eastern and southern regions from Friday to next Tuesday, bringing snowstorms and temperature plummet to these areas, China's Central Meteorological Station (CMS) said Thursday.
The cold snap would be much stronger than the previous one, which caused up to 18 degrees Celsius temperature fall in China's northern regions from last Saturday.
The fresh one is expected to bring icy weather to the country's southern areas, the CMS said.
Areas along with the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers and the northern parts of the southern areas of the Yangtze River would experience snow, or even snowstorms in some of these regions.
BEIJING: Chinese authorities caught nearly 5, 400 suspects last year in a crackdown on online pornography and have vowed to strengthen Internet policing.

The European aircraft giant Airbus announced on Friday a price hike for all its aircraft that averages 5.
8 percent.
The price increase is the first since January 2008 and will take effect for all Airbus aircraft this year.

Fuzhou Changle International Airport has opened 6 direct flight routes to Taiwan with 42 scheduled flights each week, announced Fuzhou Customs on July 16.
As the mainland and Taiwan have been fostering a closer economic cooperation, a large growth occurred in the number of direct flights between Fuzhou and Taiwan.
It is reported that in the first half of 2010, 574 direct flights and 90, 414 passengers travelled between the two regions, a 925% and 884% increase respectively over the same period last year.
The biggest change came when Taiwan Trans-Asia Airways joined the direct flights between Fuzhou and Taipei on March 15, 2010.
It was the first Taiwan airline to join the program.
More were soon to follow.
On February 8, 2010, Taiwan Trans-Asia Airways launched Fuzhou-Taichung routes and Taiwan UNI Air began Fuzhou-Taipei Taoyuan routes for the first time on March 15.
In addition, a direct chartered flight took off at Fuzhou Airport on June 15.
The increasing flights, however, still couldn`t satisfy demand, as evidenced by the fact that all the flights were packed with passengers.
So 18 more direct flights between Fuzhou and Taiwan became available on July 9.
To ensure a smooth customs environment, the airport installed an information desk and will help passengers with any concerns.

No one suggests that in an age that has been widely heralded as the information age, the desire for information will wane.
Fuzhou businessmen, riding the tide of the information highway, have gained growing profits through a new business pattern B2B2C, or business-business-customer pattern.
In the 2010 Guangzhou Online Trade Fair held from July 9 to July 10, many local manufacturers of house decoration and those in the textile industry rushed there.
But curiously enough, they sold no products.
If all of it makes it seem that they lack sense of business, the answer`s a big resounding no.
At the back of their minds, it pays to do [something big" in a national fair.
They were thinking of persuading otheronline dealers to become their distributors in order to expand the marketing channel.
One of his counterparts is much more responsive to the change.
He started the cooperation from this March and the number of his agencies reached 113.
With such a powerful marketing team, his company witnesses soaring sales volume in June, a figure which doubled the ones in March.
Fuzhou businessmen are wise enough to branch out their business across the country.
Traditionally, a distributor has to pay a great amount of money before he can become an authorized dealer of a product.
But it is not the case with Fuzhou businessmen.
The initial fee is as low as one yuan.
As for the delivery, they require strict time limits to reduce the costs of purchase and storage on the distributors` side.

A career hotline, 12580, was put into service in Fuzhou on July 13, which is a nod towards creating job opportunities and improving local public welfare in the province.
The hotline aims to serve as an information center for rural job-hunters and college students in Fujian Province.
They are able to ring in and enquire information of their desired job.
Since the trial run in late February, the hotline has received 11261 registered applications and has helped about 10812 people find jobs.
In addition to that, 5587 candidates had interviews online.
In order to offer better service, the hotline conducts follow-up the applicants.
5. 241 million MMS and 5.
469 SMS are sent to the targeted groups.
The hotline has become an important device for local citizens seeking job opportunities.
Huang Wenlin, vice governor of Fujian Province, said that the challenge now arising in career markets is the lack of information that is available to prospective employees on job opportunities.
The enterprises are in a bad need of employees while job-hunters are finding it increasingly difficult to find a decent job.
The arrival of this hotline bridged the gap between the enterprises and the job-hunters.
It is also a pioneering measure taking advantage of social resources to meet the needs of social sectors.
It is expected that more parties will join the platform and together change the direction of the economic development.

Fujian has a close relationship both geographically and culturally with Taiwan, with 80 percent of Taiwanese residents of Fujian descent.
Xiamen was one of the first cities in China to be opened up to foreign trade and investment as a special economic zone (SEZ) in 1979.
Because of the closeness both geographically and culturally with Taiwan, the Xiamen SEZ has targeted Taiwan to attract Taiwanese investment and facilitate bilateral trade.
Over the last few decades, Fujian has maintained close business and trade connections with Taiwan.
In May 2009, over 8, 000 Taiwanese compatriots participated in the first Straits Forum, and it is hoped that this will become an important platform for cross-Straits communication.

Fuzhou government takes measures against water logging The Fuzhou Municipal Department has set up three 24-hour onsite offices on Fuma Road, Fufei Road and Minjiang River Bridge, respectively, to prepare against any possible water logging.
Due to torrential rain and the fact that some projects are under construction, the municipal drainage pipelines were clogged, which gave rise to the water logging.
In order to solve this problem, the government has set up some sheds near those projects, such as on Fufei Road and Fuma Road.
What`s more, the sheds are equipped with pumps, sandbags and other emergency tools.
Moreover, the government is also funding efforts to harness some roads which more easily cause dredging.

Besides, they also require all property companies to prepare an ample supply of sealing materials and support the transfer work of households.

DURBAN - Netherlands striker Dirk Kuyt believes any complacency towards their surprise World Cup second-round opponents Slovakia will be kept in check by their fiercest critics - themselves.
Although Netherlands and Argentina were the only sides to win all three group matches, the Dutch have yet to dazzle anyone and are determined to keep their feet on the ground.
Flying winger Arjen Robben made an immediate impact on his return from injury with a substitute appearance in the last group match against Cameroon in which he set up the winner.
That gives coach Bert van Marwijk a full squad to choose from to face the Slovakians, although Robben is again likely to start on the bench.
Gregory van der Wiel should return at rightback after being replaced by Khalid Boulahrouz for the Cameroon match to avoid the risk of a second booking.
At stake in sunny Durban is a quarterfinal against Brazil or Chile and Slovakia know they will have produce another huge performance to claim a place in the last eight.
Coach Vladimir Weiss is not surprisingly likely to keep faith with the players that beat the world champions including Miroslav Stoch and Juraj Kucka, who transformed a team that had managed just one shot on target in the 2-0 defeat by Paraguay.

BEIJING - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday called for more efforts to cut emissions and conserve energy to meet the country's target set by the 11th Five-Year Plan.
According to the plan laid out in 2006, China will cut its per unit GDP energy consumption by 20 percent compared with 2005 levels by the end of 2010.
The task of fulfilling the goal was still tough , Wen said at a State Council meeting, adding that this year would be particularly difficult as the first quarter had already seen rising energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) in the major industrial sectors.
In the first three months, six major industries, including steel, power and non-ferrous, saw a 3.
2 percent growth in energy consumption per unit of GDP, Wen said.
Wen called for stricter control over high-energy-consuming and high-polluting sectors.
More efforts were needed to reduce use of outdated capacity and curb new projects in industries with overcapacity, he said.
This year, China will phase out 10 million kilowatts of small coal-fired power generators, 25 million tonnes of outdated capacity in iron-smelting industry, 6 million tonnes in steel sector and 50 million tonnes in cement sector, Wen added.
The government will further promote energy-saving lamps and intensify efforts to lift energy efficiency in steel, power, non-ferrous, and other high-energy-consuming sectors, Wen said.
More publicity campaigns to promote energy saving and emission cuts were needed, he said.
Chinese steel exporters may see hurdles later this year, as the country is set to limit exports in high polluting, high energy-consuming, and resource sectors, according to media reports Monday.
China is to lower or scrap export tax rebates on exports in such sectors, and lift export duties of certain products starting from July, the Economic Information Daily reported, citing a senior official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The official said that the steel sector will face the most adjustments in this round of export policy changes, especially steel plate products, which may enjoy fewer or no export incentives offered earlier.
China exported 13.
02 million tons of steel products in the first four months of this year, up 98.
83 percent over the same period last year, according to customs data.
Meanwhile, export price averaged $767.
69 per ton, a decrease of 32.
9 percent year-on-year.
Analysts say it is the surging export that will lead to the policy change on steel exports, as it is not good news for the steel industry to rush in exports with dropping prices, considering the skyrocketing costs of raw materials in this sector, the China Securities Journal said.
But Qi Xiangdong, deputy secretary general of the China Iron and Steel Association, argued that the surge in April came as a result of a low basis last year.
The country will also tighten control on exports of non-ferrous metal and fertilizer, according to the China Securities Journal.

HONG KONG: Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) opened the retail portion of its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong on Wednesday, attracting a steady stream of investors prepared to brave weak markets and concerns about demand for the roughly $20 billion offer.
Individual investors headed to local bank branches to pick up offer documents, and while foot traffic at HSBC's Kwun Tong branch in eastern Kowloon indicated decent interest in China's third-largest bank, it was hardly the frenzy that has greeted other large Chinese bank offerings.
The housewife said she had previously bought shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and China Construction Bank (CCB) when they went public, and compared to those Chinese banks, ABC was cheap in terms of valuation.
9 billion that ICBC raised in 2006, will be the world's largest-ever IPO.
ABC's price-to-book valuation of 1.
5 to 1.
7 times is cheaper than ICBC and CCB, but it's about the same or slightly higher than that of Bank of China - the country's fourth-largest lender.

BEIJING - Chinese provinces and municipalities in regions with heavy air pollution are to team up to combat air pollution, under a new national strategy.
The State Council announced the new strategy Monday in a circular that outlines specific measures and target regions.
The joint mechanism would help environmental protection authorities to form measures and policies based on factors concerning air pollution prevention of the larger region, rather than those of one province.
For example, the joint mechanism would monitor total emissions of air pollutants in the larger region as air pollution travels fast with wind among neighboring cities.
The measure proved effective during the 2008 Beijing Olympics when many factories in Beijing and surrounding areas were closed temporarily under government orders.
The new strategy would be first implemented in the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the region comprising Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province.
As China's major economic engines, the three regions had made progress in curbing emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, but other problems like acid rain and haze had been worsening, the circular said.
The annual number of hazy days in the three regions had exceeded 100 for several consecutive years, said the circular.
In addition to sulfur dioxide, air pollutants such as nitric oxide and particulate matter would be monitored to curb their total emissions, the circular said.

With a designed speed of 250 km per hour, the 158-km-long rail will serve both passenger and freight trains.
Shen Jianming, director of the Tianjin section of the rail, said the rail will have seven stations between Tianjin and Baoding, and will open in 2013.

Reaching Changchun, Dalian, Nanjing, Hefei and Hohhot, he said, would take three hours.
Other experts at the forum said that high-speed railway lines would do wonders to boost the country's economy and make it easier to transport resources.
During the same two years the total length of working railway lines in China will reportedly increase from 80, 000 kilometers to more than 100, 000 kilometers, 18, 000 kilometers of which will be high-speed passenger rails.
China currently has the most high-speed rails in the world with more than 6, 500 kilometers of track running trains at speeds of either 200 to 500 kilometers per hour or 350 kilometers per hour.

BEIJING: China's exports may grow by 8 percent in 2010 but problems still existed with getting exports back to pre-crisis levels, according to a statement posted Monday on the website of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), quoting minister Li Yizhong.
It was unlikely for China's exports to recover to pre-crisis levels in the short-term, Li said during a Sunday meeting attended by MIIT officials, attributing the slow rebound to rising international protectionism and the fact that Chinese manufacturers relied too much on overseas markets.
Despite overtaking Germany as the world's largest exporter, China saw its exports contract 16 percent year-on-year in 2009 as overseas demand slumped.
Exports in January this year grew 21 percent on lower comparison bases a year ago due to the global economic downturn and less working days as the Lunar New Year holiday fell in January last year, said the General Administration of Customs earlier this month.
Li also stressed that China should keep the yuan stable in a speech addressing the current domestic economic situation during the meeting, as international pressure on China to strengthen the yuan was intensified.

For China watchers who have been keen to know the role China will play in the international arena, they should not miss two explicit messages from Premier Wen Jiabao during his meeting with the press yesterday.
The first message is Premier Wen's reiteration that China will stick to its policy of opening up.
This should be interpreted as a double blessing to 1.
3 billion Chinese and the international community.
Among the many implications of upholding the opening up policy, one point is crystal clear: China will never refrain from interacting with the outside world.
On the other hand, while proceeding on the track of opening up, the country will be integrated deeper into international political and economic frameworks.
Hence, it goes without saying that China will continue to be a trustworthy partner and responsible player in bilateral and multilateral platforms.
The stronger the economic position it gains, the more responsibilities it will shoulder in handling international affairs.
As for the second message from Wen yesterday, magnanimity is the key word.
The Chinese premier impressed the audience with his benevolence and tolerance when responding to ill-willed speculation and even erroneous accusations against China from abroad.
His patient explanation of what happened during the Copenhagen climate change summit - and response to the biased views toward China - demonstrate broad-mindedness that befits the leader of a large nation.
This should make those who are set on throwing mud in the eyes of China feel ashamed.

A statistical working conference on the property prices in 10 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Tianjin and Shenyang, will be held in Beijing Friday afternoon, said Ma Jiantang, chief of the National Bureau of Statistics, on the sidelines of a national congress.
Attendees to the meeting, which will focus on how to improve data collecting in the property industry, included real estate developers as well as members from industry guilds, Ma said.
The bureau chief added that he had just returned from a similar working conference in south China's booming metropolis Shenzhen.
The bureau's method of collecting data on property markets should be upgraded from current linear reports by real estate developers to a two-way channel combined with statisticians' examination of the markets.
In addition to this, the bureau should change its statistics release system since the generalized annual report in its current form smoothes over and covers up the monthly or quarterly market fluctuations, which seriously lessens its informative value, Ma said.

18 trillion yuan for public investment in the time period between the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2010, Xie said.
It is estimated that in 2009, the central government allocated about 924.
3 billion yuan for public spending, up 503.
8 billion yuan from the 2008 budget, according to the minister.
According to the original plan, the 1.
18 trillion yuan from the central government included 104 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of 2008, 487.
5 billion yuan in 2009 and 588.
5 billion yuan in 2010.
It is believed that as new investment on public projects in 2009 surpassed the original budget of 487.
5 billion yuan, the budget for 2010 was reduced from the original 588.
5 billion yuan to 572.
2 billion.
Jointly authorized by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and the Ministry of Science and Technology, the innovation bases will receive help from the ministries in research and development funding, personnel training and business information, an official with the MOC told Xinhua.
The new bases bring to 58 the number designated since 2006 as part of an effort to boost foreign trade through technology and innovation.
Customs statistics show exports of mechanical and electrical products last month soared 26.
9 percent year-on-year to $78.
05 billion.
Exports of those products last year amounted to $713.
1 billion, accounting for 59.
Such a high-profile commitment to higher wages is certainly an overdue salute to the hundreds of millions of workers in the country who have made significant efforts to help build a well-off society in an all-round way.
There is also a far-reaching significance of raising incomes for laborers: It is the only way for China to effectively boost domestic consumption to pursue sustainable economic growth.
But the rise of their wages is too slow compared with the expansion of national wealth.
As a result, consumption has actually fallen as a share of GDP in recent years.
The global economic crisis since late 2008 has made it clear that China can no longer rely excessively on investment and export for growth.
China must embrace consumer-led growth to address both domestic and global economic imbalance.
BEIJING - Chinese President Hu Jintao Saturday urged people nationwide to keep planting trees in a voluntary way to help build a more attractive country.
Hu made the remarks when he was planting trees with young pioneers together with other top leaders of the country including top legislator Wu Bangguo and Premier Wen Jiabao at the Beiwu park in the northern part of the capital.
Hu said the voluntary tree planting activity helped improve the environment and fight global warming.
Hu called on constant efforts to mobilize the whole society to join the activity to create a beautiful and hospitable environment.
Over the past three decades, more than 12 billion people had planted some 56 billion trees across the country, statistics showed.
Last year alone, China planted 88.
27 million mu (5. 88 million hectares) of trees.
Legend Holdings Ltd plans to include energy and environmental protection industries in its major investment fields, said Chairman and President Liu Chuanzhi in an interview with the China Business News on Thursday.
Legend, a private company, has always been keen on investing in energy, environmental protection, and health industries, fields that were previously not easy for private companies to enter, Liu said.
The company will invest directly into those industries and operate them as core assets, he added.
The Chinese government will encourage private investments in sectors currently controlled by State-owned enterprises, such as transportation, telecommunications, energy, public utility, scientific and technological programs for national defense, and affordable housing projects, according to a statement released after the State Council's executive meeting on Wednesday.
Legend has already invested in the financial industry.
In January, it became the biggest shareholder of Hankou Bank in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei province.
But Liu told the paper that the company would exert caution before increasing investment in the field.
Legend will unveil details about its investment strategy after a work meeting on April 12, the report said.

Despite the close timing, analysts said the two fundraising plans were not likely to fall too close together, as Bank of China's plan still required shareholder approval and was likely to be at least a month before it could proceed.
One such step, which China has resorted to several times in the past, could be a freeze on new fundraising in Shanghai by locally listed companies.
The fundraising should also have less impact than its large numbers imply because many of the new shares would presumably be purchased by the bank's largest shareholder, Central Huijin Investment Co, a government entity that holds about 68 percent of the bank.
Analysts predicted the placement was unlikely to come until September at the earliest, and could even take place in the fourth quarter.
In its Friday announcement, Bank of China did not specify prices for the rights offering.
Analysts said that based on past experience with other Chinese banks, the rights should be priced at a discount of 30-40 percent to the bank's current share price.
LONDON: The Bank of England has left interest rates at a record low of 0.
5 percent and has made no change in its 200 billion pounds ($320 billion) monetary stimulus program.
Analysts believe the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee will stand pat at least until next month and wait for clearer evidence on the state of the economy.
Recent signs that Britain emerged from recession in the fourth quarter have yet to be confirmed by official data, and reports have shown that consumers are continuing to pay off debt rather than borrowing to keep spending.
Coupled with the euro depreciation, this could mean a weaker industry outlook throughout this year and into 2011.
The current situation will likely effect demand since all Chinese suppliers are significantly exposed to European markets.
To hedge the risks of a volatile exchange rate, some suppliers chose forward exchange settlements and financial derivatives, by which an agreement on future exchange rates was signed to offset price fluctuations, according to some industry players.
The company lost 10 percent in profit as the euro dived as much as 20 percent but its revenue soared almost 80 percent, partly offsetting the losses, according to Wang.
Despite the exchange losses, solar cell suppliers are rather bullish on the market outlook.
ET Solar expanded its production capacity to 600 megawatts (mW) this year from 150 mW in 2009, partly driven by its ambition to explore emerging markets, such as the US.
Yingli Solar said its exports to the US will triple to 100 mW this year and it is also optimistic about other fast-growing markets including Australia, the Czech Republic and Poland.
PetroChina Co will spend 9.

The shareholding in China Petroleum Finance Co, majority owned by parent China National Petroleum Corp, will be increased to 49 percent from 7.
5 percent, according to a statement filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
The Beijing-based company will also inject 7.
18 billion yuan into the capital reserves of China Petroleum Finance, it said.
The transaction will allow PetroChina to tap into the financial services and benefits of China Petroleum Finance, the company said.
4 billion yuan from a restated 114.
5 billion yuan in 2008, the company reported yesterday.
The drop was caused by lower oil prices, it said.
The Ministry of Science and Technology has approved the building of a High-Tech Industry Belt Circling Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province, making it one of the seven national High-tech Industry Belts.
Hebei Provincial Government attaches high emphasis on its cooperation with Beijing and Tianjin to push forward the integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei.
The Belt is an important measure taken for the construction of modern industry system and transformation of economic development modes by taking advantages of all the resources around Beijing and Tianjin in more fields.
The Belt is positioned as a national high-tech demonstration zone for pioneering and innovation, around Bohai industry clusters for high-tech industry, core zone for high-tech achievements and Heibei modern industry system main areas.
The short-term goal is to build it into an influential national high-tech industry belt by 2015, with the development zone and high-tech industry base as its main supports and the industry clusters as its main body.

BEIJING: China's General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) on Thursday unveiled a new list of 48 domestic Internet websites where porn cyber and cellphone games were found, warning it would shut down those sites if they do not clean up porn contents.

There has been no timetable for the construction of a maglev line project between Hangzhou and Shanghai, a spokesman of the Shanghai municipal government said Monday.
The project is still undergoing feasibility studies, the official said when responding to media reports last week which said the construction is expected to start this year.
The proposal of the ultra-high-speed maglev line, with an estimated cost of 22 billion yuan (3. 22 billion U. S. dollars), was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission in 2006.
When completed, the line is expected to cut the travel time between Shanghai and Hangzhou, capital of the neighboring Zhejiang Province, to half an hour from the current 2.

Some of the phones are too rare to be found in an ordinary shopping mall, she said, pulling out a Louis Vuitton flip phone and a Nokia E90 covered by an unusual rosy metal crust.
Lu said selling unwanted luxury goods was popular in other countries she had lived in - Britain, Italy and Switzerland - and she decided it was an idea that would work in Beijing.
Last September, she opened her first luxury goods commission store - Rain-Wow Consignment Store near the Fourth Ring Road.
The store is good for both buyers and sellers, she said.
On one hand, it offers luxury handbags and accessories at a fraction of the price new; while on the other, sellers receive a better return compared to pawnshops.
Lu said she slept only two hours a day in the build-up to the opening of her first shop.
Lu is by no means short of money.
She drives expensive cars and changes her phones, watches, and bags frequently.
However, she admits that she is never content with what she has.
Lu was an orphan born in Hangzhou.
Her adopted parents treated her badly and she was cast off from the family at the age of 15.
A kind teacher took care of her and brought her to Hong Kong in 1980s.
On April 8, the Qilu Spring Auto Show 2010 hosted by Qilu Evening and Life Daily was grandly opened.
Tens of thousands of citizens were attracted to visit or buy cars here.
As the largest Qilu Auto Show, this Spring Auto Show has an indoor and outdoor exhibition area of 50, 000 square meters, which broke the record of the previous Qilu Auto Shows in scale.
None of the main brands of the domestic car circle are absent in this Show, which resulted in the unprecedented large line-up of new cars, amazing live interactive show and prevailing discounts.
Dadoo, the mascot of the City of Springs Website, made its debut in this Qilu Spring Auto Show by taking pictures with many pretty car models.
A stronger-than-expected surge in exports during May is compelling testimony to the resilience of Chinese exporters.
That does not, however, mean the country can slow the pace of shifting from export reliance to domestic consumption for economic growth.
Such encouraging trade data should help ease fears that Chinese exporters are vulnerable to external uncertainties.
Just a few months ago, policy-makers were overwhelmingly concerned about whether these exporters would survive the shock of even a small appreciation in the value of the renminbi against the US dollar.
Yet, last month when the Chinese currency gained about 20 percent against the euro, exporters beat almost all forecasts to increase shipments to the European Union by 50 percent from a year earlier.
Some observers have been quick to point out that the European debt crisis has not started to bite yet and might begin hurting China's shipments only in the next three months.
If proved correct, exporters do need to brace for subdued demand from the country's biggest trading partner.
But a much faster growth in exports to some developing markets means Chinese exporters have more room to maneuver now than in the past when they had to rely heavily on demand from developed countries.
But the current bullish trend should not blind policy-makers to the pressing need to change the growth model.
Exporters must be urged to prepare for all the necessary reforms the country is bound to take in order to boost domestic consumption.

As the sea gets rough, we head inland to Daxinzhuang village of east China's Shandong province, where 14 bronze relics from the Shang Dynasty some 3, 000 years ago have been found.
The find, which was made earlier this year, has great archeological significance.
All 14 pieces are found in tomb No. 139 at the site.
Among them is a bronze Ding, an ancient cooking vessel with two loop handles and three legs.

QINGDAO, Shandong-- A large expanse of green algae is floating towards east China's coastline, an oceanic official said Tuesday.
The green algae, namely enteromorpha prolifera, presently covers about 200 square kilometers of sea off China's Shandong Province.
The green mass is about 13 kilometers from Jiaonan city and 16 km from Dagong Island, according to the North China Sea Branch (NCSB) of the State Oceanic Administration.
The NCSB first detected the green expanse in the sea off the coast of Rizhao city in Shandong last Monday and since it has continued to drift north.
It would move northward, according the sea's flow, at a speed of 7-9 kilometers per day and would come closer to the coastline, said Liu Fenglin, spokeswoman of NCSB.

Though not poisonous and with no affect on water quality, the algae can consume large amounts of oxygen, threatening marine life, according to Pang Shaojun, professor of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
If the green algae was not cleaned in time, it could affect the development of the tourism sector in the coastal area as the rotten algae emits a foul smell, according to Pang.

Local residents and soldiers removed tens of thousands of tonnes of the algae in 2008 before the Beijing Olympics' sailing competitions kicked off in Qingdao of Shandong.

The survey, conducted by a matchmaking agency in Guangzhou among 15, 000 respondents who were not married, found 54 percent of Guangzhou's single people would demand a house for marriage.
Women have fallen biggest victim to the current soaring housing prices, as they are more concerned about having a house to form a family.
But for the male respondents, more than 90 percent said they wouldn't care if their potential life partner has a house or not, and only 50 percent said they had a house, according to the survey.
Hu Zhanhong, a senior adviser of the matchmaking agency, said housing is indeed affecting Guangzhou residents' marriage plans, but people also have to reshape their thinking about finding a partner.
Twenty years ago, women could accept living in the dormitories of their partners' places of work as well as with the men's parents.
The government should form favorable policies for single people to buy a house, but it is also very important for single people to reshape their thinking about having a house before marriage, Hu said, adding that if a woman takes it for granted that buying a house is the obligation of the man, then she may miss out on a lot of good chances.

The new blockade rules come in response to an outcry following a deadly Israeli raid on a blockade-busting flotilla at the end of May.
The changes will improve Gazans' access to goods from household cleaners to timber, but Israel will continue to ban most travel and exports from Gaza and restrict the import of desperately needed construction materials.
Gaza business leaders and rights activists said the measures are far short of what Gaza needs, and that the only active cargo crossing, Kerem Shalom, may not be enough to bring in all the goods now permitted.
Israeli officials said the remaining restrictions, including on exports, are essential for maintaining security.
On Monday, goods dropped off at Kerem Shalom included washing machines, which were previously banned from import.
Aid supplies that had been transported on the intercepted flotilla also found their way to the crossing, including previously banned mattresses.
Israel started restricting movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza after the 2006 capture of an Israeli soldier, Sgt. Gilad Schalit, by Hamas-allied militants.
A year later, when the Islamic militant Hamas overran Gaza, Israel -- backed by Egypt -- imposed a fuller closure, allowing in only a few dozen types of humanitarian goods like basic foods and medicine.

Relevant lines have been closed and are expected to reopen until next Monday.
Long-haul trains will be rerouted while alternative options for commuters will also be available, German railway operator Deutsche Bahn said.
Yemen, the ancestral homeland of al-Qaida network leader Osama bin Laden, has intensified security operations and air raids against terrorist groups, after the Yemen-based al-Qaida wing claimed responsibility for a botched Christmas Day attempt to blow up a US passenger plane bound for Detroit in December.
Last Monday, a Yemeni suicide bomber carried out a botched assassination attempt targeting British envoy to Yemen Tim Torlot.
The attack only left the bomber dead and three passersby injured while the diplomat and his escorts survived unscathed.
On August 28, 2008, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the Saudi deputy interior minister who heads Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism campaign, survived a failed suicide assassination attack that later Yemen- based al-Qaida militancy claimed responsibility.
BAGHDAD -- Two roadside bombs targeting Shiite pilgrims went off in different areas of Baghdad on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people injured, local police source told Xinhua.
The source said 16 pilgrims were wounded by the first blast in New Baghdad district, southeastern Baghdad, while another roadside bomb blast in Fadheleh district in southern Baghdad wounded four people.

MOSCOW - The United States wishes to improve ties with Russia, though they will keep on defending their own political interests, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Sunday in Armenian capital Yerevan.
Clinton, who visited Armenia under her trip to Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region, said the United States' and Russian views proved to move closer concerning Iran and Afghanistan issues.
But that doesn't mean that there should be agreement on all issues, she added.
Clinton said that the United States will not agree with Moscow's stance on Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Clinton said the United States cooperated with OSCE Minsk Group over the settlement of Nagorny-Karabakh issue, but concerning Russian-Georgian conflict in 2008, the US is on Georgia's side.
Long-standing tensions between Russia and the former Soviet republic of Georgia turned violent during a five-day war in August 2008, when Tbilisi attacked South Ossetia, where most residents are Russian passport holders, in an attempt to bring it back under central control.
Clinton said that people all over the world should be convinced that the United States and Russia would closely cooperate on solving all the problems.
The secretary of state also said that Russia and the United States will continue working on cooperation.

WASHINGTON - US Congress on Thursday overwhelmingly passed the Iran sanctions bill, paving way for the Obama administration to take unilateral sanctions on Tehran over its controversial nuclear program.
The bill, which was passed by 408-8 in the House of Representatives and by 99-0 in the Senate, would be send to President Barack Obama to sign into law.
The United States, Israel and other Western countries worry that Tehran may obtain the uranium fuel needed for nuclear weapons by the same process to purify uranium.
The Iranian government insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purpose.
As part of efforts to compliance with the UN Security Council Resolution 1929, the Obama administration last week extended sanctions on more Iranian individuals and firms due to Tehran's suspected nuclear program.
The additional sanctions target Post Bank of Iran, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps entities and individuals, five Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines front companies and so on, according to a statement released by the US Treasury Department.
The resolution, which imposes the fourth round of sanctions on Tehran, prohibits Iran from investing abroad in nuclear and enrichment operations and calls on Iran, once again, to refrain from continuing its uranium-enrichment program.
The resolution prohibits all UN member states from selling to Iran eight categories of heavy weapons, including battle tanks, attack helicopters, and missile systems.
CARACAS: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday that he had ordered F-16 jets to intercept a US military plane that twice violated Venezuelan airspace earlier in the day.
The F-16s escorted the US plane out, he added.
However, the US military denied that any of its planes entered Venezuelan airspace on Friday.
Last month, Chavez accused the United States of flying an unmanned spy plane into Venezuela's airspace and vowed to shoot down any similar aircraft in the future.
Venezuela suspended diplomatic ties with Colombia in July in response to a US-Colombian military base deal, saying it would pave the way for the United States to invade Venezuela.

SAN DIEGO: A successful AIDS vaccine remains elusive, but researchers say aggressive, early anti-viral therapy might provide a way to derail the spread of disease.
The goal is to catch new AIDS cases early and administer therapy to reduce the amount of virus in the patient's system.
Anti-retroviral therapy has increased in the past five years.
But it's been given too late in the course of infection.
By the time people start therapy they have infected most of those that they would have infected anyway.
That's according to Brian Williams of the South African Center for Epidemiological Modeling and Analysis.
The research was presented Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Diego.

This image provided by Anthony Wesley shows an amateur astronomer's view of Jupiter Thursday June 3, 2010, who said he witnessed a bright flash, upper left, from an object hitting the Jovian surface.
[Agencies]
LOS ANGELES - Jupiter has gotten whacked again.
An amateur astronomer in Australia peering at the giant gas planet Thursday reported witnessing a bright flash from an object hitting Jupiter and apparently burning up in the atmosphere.
Wesley, a computer programmer with a good reputation among professional astronomers, alerted the cosmic collision to professional and amateur sky-gazers.
The discovery was later confirmed by another amateur astronomer in the Philippines.
Wesley gained fame last year when he spotted a scar the size of the Pacific Ocean near Jupiter's south pole believed to have been caused by an asteroid smacking into the planet.
Using an infrared telescope on Hawaii, NASA scientists found evidence that Jupiter was apparently struck near its south pole, and credited Wesley.
The latest hit near the equator has not left any visible mark so far, but astronomers are on the lookout.
The absence of a detectable gash and the short impact time have led scientists to believe Jupiter was likely struck by a meteor.
The latest collision should give astronomers a better idea of the size of debris floating in the outer solar system.
In 1994, Jupiter was bombarded by pieces of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.

This is the first time a Chinese company becomes a sponsor of the world's largest soccer event.
It also represents the rapid development in China's solar energy technology and industry, Yingli Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Miao Liangsheng said.
Miao also serves as the Executive Director on the Photovoltaic Committee of the China Renewable Energies Association, the Vice Chairman of the China Rural Area Electricity Supply Association, the Vice Chairman of the China Cells Industry Association, the Director of the Hebei New and High Technology Industry Association, and the Director of the New Energy Chamber of Commerce of All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

It sells photovoltaic products to Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, France, South Korea, China, and the United States.
China is likely to consume the world's most energy this year, and could take half of the world's total consumption in 2020 if it keeps the developing pattern unchanged, the Beijing Times reported Monday citing an expert.
If China reduces the energy consumption per GDP unit by 20 percent every five years, the country still consumes more than 30 percent of the world's total consumption 10 years later, Zhou was quoted as saying in the paper.
China has been ranked No 2 in energy consumption since 2002.

BEIJING - China's Ministry of Commerce Tuesday made a cautious prediction for the outlook of the nation's foreign trade for the rest of the year amid the fragile global economic recovery.
The rebound of China's overseas shipments in the first quarter can largely be attributed to the low comparison base of the same period last year, the commerce ministry report said.
China is facing deteriorating trade conditions as trade protectionism is on the rise, the report added.
China suffered 19 trade-remedy investigations in the first quarter, up 93.
5 percent over the same time last year.
The investigations, targeting Chinese products, involved trade worth $1.
19 billion, the report said.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said renminbi was at a reasonable level, and that China did not deliberately pursue a trade surplus with the United States.
US president Barak Obama earlier said his administration was pushing China to enforce trade rules and further open their markets, adding to a range of issues weighing on relations between the world's biggest and third-biggest economies.
Markets, too, were not counting on a brisk rise.
Offshore one-year dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), a rough gauge of market sentiment, on Thursday implied a 2.
8 percent rise in yuan over the next 12 months, slightly less than on Wednesday.
Zuo Chuanchang, a researcher with the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, a think-tank under the National Development and Reform Commission, said a row over renminbi would not lead to anything like a trade war.

Lying in a broad, fertile valley in the northwest of Yunnan Province, the Old Town of Lijiang has been a commercial, political and cultural center of the Naxi people and other ethnic minorities for over eight centuries.
Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, Lijiang's Naxi people still preserve much of their native Dongba culture and deep spiritual connection to nature.
Lijiang may spoil you with its beauty.
Snow-capped mountain vistas, ancient architecture and streets, canals and waterways, and the Naxi people and their distinct culture give Lijiang its universal value to mankind.
The aged wooden buildings decked with hanging red lanterns and local musicians playing their centuries-old Naxi instruments in the time-worn streets, display a lifestyle and culture that seem lost in time.
As UNESCO describes the village on its website, [The Old Town of Lijiang, which is perfectly adapted to the uneven topography of this key commercial and strategic site, has retained a historic townscape of high quality and authenticity.
Its architecture is noteworthy for the blending of elements from several cultures that have come together over many centuries.
Lijiang also possesses an ancient water-supply system of great complexity and ingenuity that still functions effectively today.
Lijiang`s old town was designated as a town around the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
From 1253 on, the Naxi people of Lijiang developed a unique social system, customs and culture of their own under the rule of a hereditary succession of chieftains of the Mu clan.
In the 18th century, the Qing Dynasty rulers implemented a policy of cultural interaction, and the Naxi people adopted the customs of the Tibetan and Han peoples.
Despite several earthquakes that hit Lijiang, and because of renovation, most of the old town retains its original structure.
Lijiang covers an area of 14 square kilometers, and has over 4, 200 households.
It is also known as Dayan Town, meaning large ink stone, as it is laid out in the shape of a traditional Chinese ink stone.
Its architecture is noteworthy for its blending of many varied elements from several different cultures that have come together there over many centuries.

A typical house has two stories.
A row of three main rooms on the ground floor faces south and is flanked on each side by a row of three rooms projecting at right angles and opening inward to form a front courtyard, hidden from public view by a wall.
1. Visitors should refrain from intense sports, rapid walking, running or other physical activities, due to Lijiang`s high altitude.
Instead of drinking too much, eating more vegetables and fruits is advisable.
Medicines should be carried for the aged and those in poor health.

The Old Town of Lijiang owns the laudatory title of historical and cultural town of China and world cultural heritage.
And the Mu Residence is a critical piece of the town.

Compared with other chieftains in China`s southwest, they were known for being well-educated.
Located in the southwestern part of the town, its appearances in the Ming Dynasty are magnificent.
Xu Xiake from the Ming Dynasty once spoke highly of the compound, [the magnificence of the compound is as splendid as the imperial palace".
It is a pity that most houses were ruined by warfare at the end of the Qing Dynasty.
And the stone archway was abolished during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
After an earthquake in 1996, World Bank recognized its value and made a heavy loan for its restoration.
Thanks to the exquisite design and hard work by craftsmen , it was rebuilt three years after the quake.

Dongba painting originated from the ancient Dongba hieroglyphs (pictures representing words) as well as from the various Dongba religious activities.
For instance, during the sacrificial ceremonies, the ceremony masters had to dress like Buddha or gods, or animals and plants, or even demons.
Dongba artists then would draw these images down onpaper, creating a primitive form of today's Dongba painting.
Dongbascroll paintings as well as the art of Dongba painting are invaluable treasures in the ethnic gallery.
Dongba paintings, as an important part of Dongba culture, were mainly about the gods andghosts who Naxi people believed to exist.
The paintings also reflected various aspects of the people's social life.
Bamboo-pen paintings, the first kind, were mostly used for the bindings and illustrations of Dongba scriptures.
These paintings were painted on a piece of bark-made paper by artists using a tipped bamboo plate as a pen with ink on the tip.
Wooden plate paintings, the second kind , were a special kind of Dongba painting that was used for sorcery activities.
On a flat wooden plate, a Dongba artist would first draw the sketch with a brush and then add colors to finish the picture.
Usually with ingenious designs, odd appearances, vivid expressions and bright colors, this type of painting possesses a unique artistic style.
Naxi women living in Lijiang area typically dress in a wide-sleeved loose gown topped with a waistcoat, trousers, a pleated apron and a pair of boat-shaped embroidered shoes.
Their clothes are mostly in blue, white or black, and embroidered with flower patterns on the collar, sleeves, and front.
They often wear a sheep skin stole over the shoulder where seven round patterns representing seven stars are embroidered, symbolizing the remarkable capacity and the hardworking spirit of the Naxi women.
Married women comb their hair into a bun and wear a round-shaped yarn cap.
Unmarried women coil the plaits on the back of the head, and wear a kerchief or a black velvet cap.
Yulong Snow Mountain stands beside the Jinshajiang River, northwest of the Lijiang Naxi Autonomous County, Yunnan Province.
Shanzidou, the main peak of the mountain, clad in white snow all year round, rises 5, 596 meters above sea level.
The 13 peaks, distributed from the south to the north, with the south-north length of 35 km and the east-west width of 12 km, are like a silver white jade dragon lying in the clouds, hence the name Yulong (jade dragon) Snow Mountain.
Numerous species of plants grow in the mountain, and are distributed vertically in accordance with height and climate.
The mountain enjoys the fame of the Treasure House of Plants.
Her beauty stems not only from the grand mountains and silver white snow, but also from the fast-changing climate with the alternation of day and night and the shifting of the four seasons.
There are many other scenic attractions atop the mountain.
Because of the steep cliff of the main peak, the mountain is yet to be conquered, albeit mountaineering teams from home and abroad have tried.
In the Yufeng Temple, there is a world famous camellia tree.
Though it is only about 3 meters tall, 20, 000-odd flowers blossom every year.
As legend goes, the tree was planted in the Chenghua reign of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
From the roots, the tree is identified as a silk tree combined by two.
With twisted roots and gnarled branches, the two are closely connected.
As a result, the leaves appear in two shapes, and the flowers have two kinds, the rosy red and the pink.

Joseph Rock (1884 – 1962) was an Austrian-American explorer, geographer, linguist and botanist.
From 1922 to 1949, he spent most of his time studying the flora, peoples and languages of southwest China, mainly in Yunnan, Sichuan, southwest Gansu and eastern Tibet.
Many of the Asian plants he collected can be seen in the Arnold Arboretum.
Rock began his explorations near Lijiang in the village of Yuhu, settling there in 1922 after a trip to Myanmar.
Located at the foot of Jade Dragon Mountain, Yuhu so intrigued Rock with its local charms and customs that he made it his country home.
He wrote many articles for National Geographic Magazine about his expeditions.
These articles brought him modest fame, and were said to have inspired the novel Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, about a fictional remote Himalayan community known as Shangri-La.
For the following 27 years, Rock continued roaming around Lijiang's countryside, documenting its flora and producing the first rigorous works on Naxi ethnology.
The Naxis are the original inhabitants of Lijiang district.
From 1922 to 1935, Rock wrote nine articles for National Geographic.
These articles vividly reflected the geographic conditions and ethnic culture of northwest Yunnan, with Lijiang as their central focus.
Naxi is an old ethnic minority living in Southeast China.
The Naxi people love dancing and singing.
They created and persevered a treasure of Chinese folk art --Dongba Dance.
The Dongba Dance of the Naxi people is very ancient and requires high skill.
The ancient hieroglyphs discovered in the Lijiang area in 1980 are just like patterns of dances at that time.
As the quality of these characters is close to photographs, the dancing characters are vivid as a direct painting of every dance.
In the seminar of Dongba and Daba held in Lijiang in 1983, more than 60 Dongba and Daba old people performed the Dongba sorcerer's dance in a trance.
Their dance steps basically tallied with the ancient hieroglyphDongbacharacters.

Significance\nConstruction of Daming Palace National Heritage Park was launched in October, 2008 and is expected to finish in October 2010.
Based on the originality and completeness of its relics, it will present a complete, vivid picture with thousands of years of history.
It is a beneficial exploration of China`s preservation and utilization of cultural relics in a comprehensive and large-scale manner, and it aims to be built into a demonstration project of cultural heritage preservation with Chinese characteristics and international standards for the 21st century.
Chapter I The Shadow of an Empire\nIn a sense, this song reflected people`s attitude towards historical memory, today`s life and future prophecy.
In the long history of the Chinese nation, no other dynasty, as did by the Tang dynasty, had left endless imagination for countless generations; No other city, as did by the ancient city of Chang'an, has recorded the most gorgeous memory of the Chinese people; No other palace, as did by the Daming Palace, has been bearing the Chinese people`s eternal longing.
Leaving aside the historical records that showed us the brilliant majesty of the building, the ruins of the palace now, after more than 1, 000 years, still gives us great amazement.
Passing through the Danfeng gate and walking to the north, a 610-meter long, 150-meter wide pilgrim road leading you directly up to the Empire`s palace.
This road has recorded the footprint of many famous people including poet Li Bai, marshal An Lushan, the emperor`s dearest concubine Yang Yuhuan, hierarch Abe Nakamaro, Lady Guoguo, peasant uprising leader Huang Chao and emperor Zhu Wen of Later Liang.
Standing on the ruin of the Hanyuan Hall, the main hall of the Daming Palace, without strong search, one can subconsciously mull into a deep thought of the lost glory of the ancient gigantic empire.
Perhaps, we could not effectively bring back history into the reality and we might only can see the melancholy view of the back of an empire.
Even so, the great pride and warm feeling generated by the Daming Palace is strong enough to encourage us to move on.
Archaeology: Half a century persistence\nArchaeology is a scientific study of ancient society by excavation and survey through the remains of ancient human relics.
And Archaeology is the major path for modern people to approach their ancient ancestors, especially for those living in the Daming Palace which now turned into ruins.
If the Daming Palace can be described as an elder older than 1, 000 years old, the archaeological study of Daming Palace should be a vibrant youth as only after the founding of new China in 1949, the first archaeological team was dispatched to the Daming Palace area.
Dozens of groups of young archaeologists have devoted their heart, energy and youth to this land and have driven the Daming Palace ruins which has been in dormancy for more than a thousand years back to life.
From figure out the size of the Daming Palace, to draw the first survey map of the palace, and from focusing on excavation of the main hall – Hanyuan Hall, to shifting the archaeological goal to site preservation and protection gradually.
Archeology has helped people in the modern world understand and rediscover the Daming Palace more and more clearly.
Although we cannot remember the name of each archaeologist, history will never forget their deed.
Show Time: Long-buried memories\nThe ultimate goal of archaeological excavation is to understand the site more clearly, in hope to protect it better.
How to preserve the physical evidence of human civilization and how to protect the brilliant memory the once flourishing Tang Dynasty Daming Palace has left for today's people?
This is a question.
People who are taking care of the Daming Palace are about to crack the hard question with their careful planning and blueprint of a thorough evaluation and preservation.
The curtain of Daming Palace protection has been opened.
In the same time next year, visitors are expected to taste the Tang glory and grandeur as they wander here leisurely.
The Daming Palace ruins which were covered by deep grass have been exposed through a large scale of excavation and now is undergoing a large preservation and protection project.
The result is beautiful and the process is more worthy of recording and appreciation.
Humanities angle: Dream's footsteps\nThe Daming Palace with an area of 3.
5 square kilometers has seen numerous people left footprints here, from emperors and marshals to unknown civilians.
More than 100 years ago, Japanese tourists Kiroku Adachi and Jitsuzo Kuwabara set foot on this land, leaving for modern people the earliest records of images of the Daming Palace.
We do not know what kind of reverence feeling they carried from the bottom of their heart, when they sat down on the stone column bases of the Hanyuan Hall ruin site the late autumn of 1907.
Whether they saw the glorious ceremonies of Tang dynasty in their mind and felt the grandeur of the ancient dynasty with their heart?
Of course, they were only passers-by.
Life: Plain perseverance\nSeventy years ago, a number of frustrated migrants dragging a heavy sadness and riding by train -- the new product of the industrial civilization, inadvertently set their foot near the residence of the royal family of the Golden Age of Tang Dynasty.
They have become silent guardians of this land since.
More and more people marginalized by the society gathered there to make a living.
Tomorrow will be better, they believe.
Generations of people living in this region have worked hard in an attempt to remove the stigma of poverty and blindness on their head.
Now, the rows upon rows of shanty towns, rusting locking tap, muddy roads in rainy days and the stink and crowded streets are gradually disappearing.
The life pattern which hundreds of thousands of people have live for 70 years are being under re-deconstruction.
Replicas of Terracotta Warriors and Horses\nAfter visiting the exhibition of Terracotta Warriors and horses in Xi`an, replicas of the statues make ideal travel souvenirs and presents.

They were painted with colors, and were vividly produced.
The replicas can supply the demand of foreign visitors, and enrich our art treasury.
Tang Tri-Colored Glazed Pottery\nIn Xi`an, a large quantity of tri-colored pottery figures, horses and camels were excavated from the Tang tomb.
Copies of Tang tri-colored glazed pottery are colorful and vivid, and the horses and camels have unique artistic value.
They are very popular travel gifts.
With a blaze of color and pageantry, Tang Dynasty Music and Dance Show is definitely a feast for your eyes.

And Tang Dynasty Music and Dance is just the major symbol of the essence of Tang culture.
The show usually contains magnificent singing and dancing scenes, being an immortal portrait of its prosperity.
The show was originated from folk fetes, where our ancestors, with rhythmical gestures, prayed for a peaceful and happy life.
Their dream came true during the early and middle periods of the Tang Dynasty, when the royal court ruled well and people lived in harmony.
Besides, the culture and arts also flourished as ever before, with music and dance reaching their peaks.

Still well preserved today, sprawling ancient residential compounds in south Anhui are a symbol of the Huishang's former prosperity.
Renowned Hui merchants (Huishang in Chinese) prospered for more than 500 years.
In an ancient land dominated by self-reliant agriculture for thousands of years, the merchants of Anhui made a unique contribution to China's development.
For more than a thousand years, Hui merchants--the collective name of Anhui merchants--created a legend through their hard work, enterprise and honesty.
Beginning as vendors selling small articles in the countryside and cities, then becoming big operations with sales networks covering the country, the success of the Huishang was matched by no other group except the merchants of Shanxi, also renowned as businesspeople.
The name Huishang was first known during the Jin Dynasty (265-420).
Their sun began to set in the late Qing Dynasty due to fierce competition from foreign and domestic businessmen skilled in modern commerce.
But the unique culture created by the Hui merchants--teamwork, moral integrity, honesty, sympathy for the poor and loyalty to the country--is still remembered by the people in the province and the rest of the country.
Headquartered in Wuhu, Chery is one of the most successful homegrown auto manufacturers in China.

In ancient China when farming played the most important role in making a living, Huizhou was an exception.
In Huizhou, trade and business supplanted farming as the local people's first way of making money and supporting a family.
Business and Confucianism were thus closely related, which characterized the Hui merchants.
On the one hand, generations of the Hui Confucius merchants invested in Confucianism education after their business success.
On the other hand, Confucianism imposed great influence on their business operation.
The emphasis on Confucianism and education contributed to Hui merchants' outstanding management skills and flexible strategies.
Historical records show most of the Hui merchants were well educated, some of them went back to study Confucianism when they retired from business, while others kept reading and studying as they did business.
Some even invested in the construction of Confucius schools.
Zheng Kongman, a Hui merchant in the Ming Dynasty(1368-1644), was a good example of the Confucius merchants.
Zheng would take books with him whenever he traveled on business, and squeezed any time to read.
Each of his business visits would be followed by visits of the local scholars and authors.
A neighbor, merchant Zheng Zuo, was even more addicted to Confucius books, to such an extent that his partners and competitors wondered whether he was really a businessman.
Hui merchants thought the wealth they obtained through business should not stop the education of their children, and that wealth accumulation, without the support of Confucianism, counted as little.

Gela noodles\nOriginated in 1980s, Fuyang Gela noodle is quite popular among the locals and can be seen from every street.
Gela means [mix" in the local dialect.
This noodle is mixed with various seasoning.
Recommended places: Liufang Street, located in the center of the city, has a range of all the snacks of Fuyang.

Tunxi Green Tea\nNative: Tunxi county\nAppearance: firmly rolled and dark-green with lasting chestnut fragrance\nBrew: clear-yellowish green with aftertaste\nPraised 'green gold', This tea is one of top ten Chinese teas.
First known around since 7th century and became one of the trades between China and Europe from the 16th century, it has been celebrated for its four beauties - green in color, clear in brew, mellow in taste, and strong in aftertaste.
Its producing area includes four neighboring counties around Tunxi.
Because teas from other counties were packed and shipped for export from here, they are collectively called 'Tunxi Green Tea'.
The standard picking is one shoot with one, two, or three young leaves depending on the grade.
There are six varieties in this tea and each of them has three grades.
This tea looks different in appearance by its varieties, but its mellowness is always the same.
Teas are distributed on the hillside from 300 to 2000 ft in elevation.
Its fertile yellow earth, plenty of rainfall, and warm temperature provide favorable growing environment for tea.
Taiping Hou Kui Tea\nNamed after its main producing area--Taiping county, Huangshan, Taiping Hou Kui tea is also one of the best 10 teas in China.
This tea won the gold medal at the Panama World Expo in 1915.
Tai Ping Hou Kui rests among the ten most famous green teas in China, but everything from the look of the leaves to the packing style differs greatly from the norm.
The absolute highest grades of Tai Ping Hou Kui will feature leaves that exceed 15cm in length and are picked in perfectly identical sizes and bound together with cotton string.
Another hallmark feature of Tai Ping Hou Kui is the grid pattern visible on each leaf that comes from the pressing during production; something that is always done by hand, not machine.
All other green teas are prized for their selected makeup of a small top-bud and leaf combination.
Older and larger leaves picked lower down usually have unfavorable tastes and looks.
Tai Ping Hou Kui is the different, with an unbelievably clean and refreshing taste along with a light grassy aroma.
The unusually large bud and leaf combination is specific to only this area of Huangshan Mountain in Anhui province.
The leaves can produce several infusions that maintain the deliciously green flavor and offer a great sight to behold with the enormous leaves standing upright in the glass.
Tea\nHuoqing Tea resembles Gunpowder tea but it is actually a much higher quality tea.
Gunpowder is made in Zhejiang province with low quality leaves while Huoqing Tea is made in Anhui province with one bud two leaves system, more tasty.
The astringency throughout the mouth sustains the notes well.
It is a overwhelming green tea for those who prefer strong flavour.
Huoqing Tea was first produced in a village named Yongxi in Anhui province so it was commonly called Yongxi Huoqing in China.
Huoqing Tea was tightly rolled, dark, glossy leaves with a few more yellowy shades.
It is called as jade fire as the tea has been fired over charcoal.
It unfurls in the cup to produce a lovely scene.
The distinctively rich and smooth floral flavor presents a pleasant balance of astringency and sweetness with a long and refreshing aftertaste.
The tea has a strong, vegetal and lasting flavour.
As it has been fired by charcoal during the process, it has a unique light smokey fragrance.
Tea\nHuoshan Huangya (Yellow Flower) is a rare yellow tea.
This tea was used an imperial tribute tea back in the Ming and Qing Dynasty.
The dry tea leaves have a shiny appearance and are very similar to Huangshan Maofeng tea.
When steeped, the leaves reveal a very peppery and fresh taste accompanied by an unusual green-yellow color of the brew.
As with most bud teas, the color and fragrance are slight.
The processing method of this tea was said to be lost and only to be re-discovered after the 70s.
Since then, Huoshan Huangya has been sent as tribute to many great leaders of China every year.
This tea won the Commercial Products of Good Quality in 1990 and China's Tea Cup in 1999, just to name a few.
Chrysanthemum tea is one of the best beverages to keep you in good shape.
According to traditional Chinese medicine, the flower can dispel excessive heat in the body, clear the eyes and help clean out harmful elements in the body.
Qing Yuan Tang, a chrysanthemum tea producer in Anhui province, has recently launched its new organic product.
Anhui is one of the top producers of chrysanthemum tea.
Its history of chrysanthemum tea production dates back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279).
Huangshan Mountain, located in southern Anhui, is known for chrysanthemum flowers with beautiful white blossoms and green pedicel.
The dried blooms from this area are the most sought-after ingredients.
The iron-pen painting dates back to Western Han Dynasty, and it prospered in Eastern Han Dynasty.
Until the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty, the art began to spread among people.
The paintings began to be exported to South-East Asia, North America and West Europe in 1956.
What makes the painting unique is that iron rather than pen is used to do the painting, and fire replaces ink.
People paint on wooden board, Xuan paper and silk, boosting very high value of art appreciation and collection.
Lead by folk artist Liu Zhuhua and his followers, a new genre with original content was formed.
Fewer people know this art now; even people in Hefei don`t know what it is about.
Thus in the 1990s, this art fell into obscurity, and is badly in need of protection.
Leshi Stone Inkstone originates in Suzhou and is very famous in ancient China.
It had been renowned in the Tang and Song Dynasties.
The stone was praised by literary masters such as Su Shi, Bai Juyi, Han Yu, and Mi Fu, and also was valued in Japan and Southeast Asia.
Making ink-stones from Leshi Stone began in Nantang and thrived in the Song Dynasty.
Leshi Stone Inksone has always been treasured by emperors and scholars.
It is recorded in many history books, but for many reasons the carving skill was lost for hundreds of years and finally recovered in the early 1980s.
Leshi Stone Inkstone mixes hardness and softness subtly and interacts well with Chinese ink.
Its sounds are clear, and its pattern goes with the shape of the stone, employing delicate carving skills.
Therefore, the Leshi Stone Inkstone is valuable for collections.
Since the rebirth of the inkstone industry, many media outlets such as CCTV, AHTV, People`s Daily (overseas edition) and others have reported this art.
Many celebrities also speak highly of it.

Hongcun Village lies in Yixian county, set against the extending part of Huangshan Mountain.
The construction of Xidi Village began in the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279).
Now the village contains 140 ancient buildings of the 14th to 19th century.
Its water-supply system is quite unique, environmentally-friendly and surprisingly well-preserved.
The construction was designed in similarity to a baffalo's body structure: Nanhu Lake is shaped like the baffalo's belly; Moon Pond looks like it's stomach; the channel its intestine.
This vivid layout of buffalo is one outstanding feature of the village.
It is indubitably a wonder among World Cultural Heritage sites.
Due to such a scientific design, the local villagers are able to enjoy many conveniences in their daily lives.
More importantly, a hardly-won harmony between man and nature has been realized here, and as a result the whole community seems to be brimming with life.
This is why Hongcun is much more popular than its counterparts.

As the central government tightens its housing policies, local governments are announcing their own policies which some analysts say may offset the tightening effect on the property market.
On January the 9th, Hangzhou local government announced its new housing policies for the year.

3 percent of the housing price if the floor space of the property is less than 140 square meters or they sell their own property in the city and buy a new one within the year.
And residents with a demolition fund can also get the subsidy if they buy properties in the city center.
Meanwhile, Nanjing local government is offering a similar subsidy which is equal to 0.
5 percent of the housing price when the home buyers want to improve their living conditions by purchasing non - luxury housing in the city.

Sources say the new local government housing policies are actually a conciliation with developers because most local government revenues come from land sales.
Such policies may offset the tightening policies of the central government.

BEIJING - Chinese provinces and municipalities in regions with heavy air pollution are to team up to combat air pollution, under a new national strategy.
The State Council announced the new strategy Monday in a circular that outlines specific measures and target regions.
The joint mechanism would help environmental protection authorities to form measures and policies based on factors concerning air pollution prevention of the larger region, rather than those of one province.
For example, the joint mechanism would monitor total emissions of air pollutants in the larger region as air pollution travels fast with wind among neighboring cities.
The measure proved effective during the 2008 Beijing Olympics when many factories in Beijing and surrounding areas were closed temporarily under government orders.
The new strategy would be first implemented in the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the region comprising Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province.
As China's major economic engines, the three regions had made progress in curbing emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, but other problems like acid rain and haze had been worsening, the circular said.
The annual number of hazy days in the three regions had exceeded 100 for several consecutive years, said the circular.
In addition to sulfur dioxide, air pollutants such as nitric oxide and particulate matter would be monitored to curb their total emissions, the circular said.

Sinopec Star Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Sinopec and its Iceland partner Geysir Energy Green Energy, signed a framework pact on June 9 to establish the Sino-Icelandic Green Energy Geothermal Development Corp, Sinopec said in a statement yesterday.
Sinopec and Geysir also planned to enlarge their existing geothermal district heating projects in Shaanxi and Hebei provinces.
The two partners started cooperating in May 2005 and operated three projects via a joint venture with a combined installed peak-load capacity of 140 megawatts thermal, capable of supplying geothermal heating energy to an area of 3 million square meters.
The establishment of the new corporation will be a platform to develop geothermal across China, Geysir said in a statement.
Geysir said the two parties share a common objective to promote further development of the renewable energy sector and to develop geothermal district heating services on a broader scale in China.
Separately, Sinopec said it's expanding the new energy business via exploration in several areas including fuel ethanol, biodiesel and biochemical.

The lamp is 48 centimeters tall, with gilding all over it, showing an imperial palace maid holding a lamp.
The lamp`s original design had the right arm of the maid holding a pipe away from her body, which kept the soot in the body of the maid to maintain the cleanliness of the room.
In 1993, the lamp was rated as a national treasure, and it is the most precious relic in the Hebei Provincial Museum.

The construction of Haixi Economic Zone also is a huge concern in Taiwan.
Yunlin, the biggest agricultural city in Taiwan, expects a smooth transportation and transaction of agricultural products across the straits.
The export of fresh agricultural products to the mainland takes up 1/3 of its total sales volume.
Haixi will provide more business opportunities to them as they are eager to enter the mainland market and branch out their business.
Decades ago, over 800, 000 locals left Fuzhou for Taiwan.
Today, they are coming back.
By the end of 2008, 9718 Taiwan-funded projects were approved by Fujian government with a paid-in capital of 14.
179 billion US dollars.
In addition, Taiwan has become the largest importer of Fujian products and its fourth biggest trade partner.
Fuzhou also unveiled its strategy to boost Fuzhou-Taiwan economic cooperation.
According to the plan, Fuzhou will relax restrictions on Taiwanese investment in the city, increase land use for Fuzhou-Taiwan cooperation, and strengthen Taiwan-related trade associations.
Admittedly, it needs cooperation from all the parties to get any movement in this huge project.
Haixi, as an emergent business attraction, is expected to become an engine to carry the exchange between the both sides of Taiwan Strait to a more fruitful level.

Fuzhou Chi Yi is a traditional form of singing and performance that is prevalent in Fuzhou, Minhou, and other regions of Fujian Province that has spread with Fuzhou people living in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Indonesia, and other nations.
Fuzhou folk singing is based on Geyang Qiang and Kun Qiang and was founded in the Jiaing reign of theMing Dynasty (1369-1644).
During theTaiping Heavenly Kingdomperiod (1851-1864) refugees from Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces flocked to Fujian Province.
Fuzhou Chi Yi performers made a living by singing from door to door.
Fuzhou Chi Yi was performed in the Fuzhou dialect with one or two people playing theerhuor sanxian.
The popularity of Chi Yi declined after the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945).
Some government departments provided support and aid to revive the traditional folk art.
With the decrease in performances and singers, Fuzhou Chi Yi is in danger of dying out this century, and needs support and protection.

When Miss Wang sent her child to the kindergarten yesterday, she was told that the school has been shut down and her child`s tuition fees would be refunded in accordance to the school`s withdrawal and refund policy.
The school is one of the 160 unlicensed kindergartens that have been closed by the Cangshan government in Fuzhou.
This clean-up campaign started in June.
An official from the education department of Cangshan district said that the number of unlicensed kindergartens has reached 160 when compared to the 75 formal ones.
Most of the unlicensed kindergartens are located at where the urban and village housing estates meet; they are low in scale, as evidenced by even less than 10 students in a school.
He also said that the authority encourages all walks of life to participate in education.
The illegal schools have to take adjustment efforts during the summer holiday and meet all the operation conditions to get official certificates if they are to continue their enrollment.

In fact, they could have employed me, but they decided against it when I told them that I could only work for them for 10 days and I wanted to get paid by the day.
It is really a tough task.

Traditionally, summer holidays are a blessing for children, but pose a great challenge for their parents.
How should their children deal with the long long holiday?
A closer examination of Fuzhou training classes indicates that most of the parents would like to send their children for physical activities.
Mr. Xu is a Fuzhou local citizen.

Children of the Paiwan minority in Taiwan province came to Fuzhou and played nose flutes together with their mainland friends on July 5.
The nose flute is a once-popular musical instrument played in Taiwan.
Other versions can be found in countries of Africa, India and the Pacific Rim.
It is made from a single bamboo node with a hole at the node area for blowing into, and three holes for the notes, on the top side of the tube.
In the olden days, a man would serenade his sweetheart with the nose flute in order to woo her and win her affections.
Over recent years, the nose flute has lost its appeal to the younger generation of Paiwan people, who have been brought up on a diet of popular music.
Now efforts have been made by the old musicians to teach the youth about this ancient art.

A group of children and teachers from Taipei, Taichung and other parts of Taiwan province arrived in Fuzhou yesterday.
Together with their friends in the mainland, they unveiled the Happy Angels Camp, hosted by Fujian Media Group and Eastern Media International Corporation (EMI).
It is the only exchange activity hosted by the media of both sides.
Children of the Paiwan minority in Taiwan province played nose flutes with their mainland friends.
The tune followed the ancient style, giving a feeling that was both special and interesting.
Their friends in Fuzhou also sang a famous children`s song in their local language.
Mr Wang is a born-and-bred teacher in Taiwan.
He introduced to the audience the difference between different kinds of warrior apparel.
The boys wear accessories made of boars and long feathers to show their dignity.
The most distinctive difference between nose flutes of the nobility and the common folk is that the latter`s were without patterns.
That night, they also made friends while playing games together.
Happy Angels Camp was initiated in Fujian in 2007.
The second camp was held in Taiwan when about 60 children from Fujian Province visited local schools with minorities and performed with them.

The opinion was voiced when Sun addressed at the Low Carbon Building Forum, a part of the Sixth APEC SME Technology Conference.
The forum also gathered representatives from the major real estate developers in China, including Wanke and SOHO, for the purpose of securing a sustainable future for the building industry.
According to earlier reports, designed life for Chinese buildings is 50 to 70 years.
However, most of the buildings in China could only last for around 30 years.
Research showed that 30 to 40 percent of the urban waste comes from the building industry, while the number of buildings demolished every year accounts for 40 percent of the gross amount in China.
Sun believed the building industry should play a leading role in delivering China's promise to reduce the carbon discharge of per unit GDP by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
Materials are without doubt one influential factor to the sustainability of a building.
For example, higher cement grade means longer durability.
But it's the details, such as a water-repellent window sill, or a heat recyclable fireplace that help reduce the depreciation of a house, said Sun.

WASHINGTON - White House Budget director Peter Orszag plans to leave his job in a few weeks, making him the first senior member of President Barack Obama's economic team to step down, Democratic sources said on Monday.
Orszag, who plans to get married in September, had never intended to stay more than two years and wants to leave before the next budget season begins in July, the sources said.
Potential successors include Laura Tyson, an economist of the University of California at Berkeley, and Gene Sperling, counselor to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.
Both are former White House economic advisers who served in President Bill Clinton's administration.
Orszag, a former Congressional Budget Office director, was one of the major players helping to shape the Obama administration's $862 billion stimulus package, which passed last year.
He also helped to champion what the administration says will be long-term cost-savings from Obama's overhaul of the healthcare system.
The Obama administration has come under pressure to rein in soaring US budget deficits, which hit $1.
4 trillion last year.
A $1.
6 trillion deficit is expected this year.
Orszag announced in a speech earlier this month that government agencies were being asked to plan for 5 percent cuts in an array of domestic programs.
Obama has also named a commission to recommend ways to tackle the budget deficit and asked it to report back a few weeks after the November congressional elections.
BEIJING - The Chinese government Tuesday published a white paper on its Internet policy, stressing the guarantee of online safety for minors.
The paper, released by the State Council Information Office, introduced the facts of the Internet situation in China, and elaborated on the country's basic policies on the Internet.
By the end of 2009, one third of the country's 384 million Internet users were minors, it said.
Online pornographic, illegal and harmful information is seriously damaging the physical and psychological health of young people, and this has been recognized as a prominent issue of public concern, said the paper.
The Chinese government attaches great importance to online safety for minors, and has always prioritized the protection of minors in the overall work of Internet information security programs.
The Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Minors stipulates that the state shall take measures to prevent minors from overindulging in the Internet, prohibit any organization or individual from producing, selling, renting or providing by other means electronic publications and Internet information containing pornography, violence, murder, terror, gambling or other contents harmful to minors.
The state encourages research and development of Internet tools that are conducive to the online protection of minors, as well as Internet products and services suitable for minors.
Families, schools and all other social units shall work together to protect minors online and create a healthy online environment for the development of minors, it said.
GUANGZHOU - A total of 311 children have been rescued in a crackdown on child smuggling in south China's Guangdong province over the past year, police authorities said Monday.
Police arrested 645 people in 276 child smuggling cases from April last year to May 25 this year, said Zhai Kaixia, deputy director of the criminal investigation department under the provincial public security department.
Zhai said the DNA database had helped reunite a boy in Shantou city with his parents in Kunming, capital of southwestern Yunnan province, 11 years after he was sold to a man surnamed Chen for 13, 800 yuan (US$2, 020).
The reward for tip-offs leading to the arrest of a suspect is 5, 000 yuan and 10, 000 yuan for information leading to the rescue of a child.
The reward for a tip-off was capped at 50, 000 yuan, he said.
URUMQI: China's leading power company Huaneng said on Monday that it would spend more than 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) in the far west Xinjiang region for energy exploration during the next ten years.
China Huaneng Group signed an agreement with the government of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region on Monday to speed up the construction of energy bases in the Junggar Basin, and the Turpan Basin and Hami.
The company sought to achieve 10 million kilowatts of installed power generating capacity per year in Xinjiang by the end of 2020, while producing 60 million tons of coal and 6 billion cubic meters of coal-turned natural gas, Cao added.
Also, according to the agreement, the regional government would support the company to integrate coal resources and carry out hydropower and wind power projects.
At the central work conference on Xinjiang's development last month, the central government stressed that the natural resources in the region should be developed in their own order while the construction of major state oil production and reserve bases, as well as other energy projects, should be accelerated.
As Xu Kuangdi retires from official duties, his conscience will certainly be clear.
The president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering is known for his sustained devotion to academic research as a scientist and clean, competent governance during his presidency and his tenure as the mayor of Shanghai.
Xu majored in metallurgy, but became interested in economics after observing that there was no shortage of life's essentials in Britain, where he was studying in the early 1980s.
Xu decided to study economics, and was soon convinced that China's nascent economic reform could get a much-needed fillip by incorporating principles of a market economy.
As director of the Shanghai Economic Planning Commission, Xu did a fine job to usher in economic reform to Shanghai.
He was made mayor of the city in 1995.
What made Xu popular was not just his honest and down-to-earth work ethic, but his admonition to family members to desist from seeking him out for official favors.
He was widely regarded as a clean and competent mayor, and when he left the city in 2001, more than a thousand local government officials and Shanghai residents went to the airport to see him off.
Very few local government leaders have left with their reputations intact as Xu managed to do.
Xu was very clear about what was needed to be done - for Shanghai's citizens and its economy - and that explains why many in the city still miss him.
His exemplary service should, hopefully, serve as a mirror to reflect upon for many others in today's power echelons.

The star of the 1986 World Cup and one of the greatest players ever, the colorful and controversial 49-year-old is sure to attract his fair share of headlines in his new guise as national coach.
The impressive nature of their 1-0 friendly win in Germany in March prompted critics to reassess their preconceptions about Argentina's chances of success, while in European Footballer of the Year Lionel Messi they boast the world's best player.
Their squad is also thick with guile and experience, despite the surprising omissions of Inter Milan pair Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso.
Argentina will face Greece, Nigeria and South Korea in the group phase and captain Javier Mascherano believes there will be no need to worry if the two-time champions don't click immediately.
Maradona, meanwhile, is confident that his team can go all the way.
DAR-ES-SALAAM - Robinho scored twice and Kaka was also on target as Brazil routed Tanzania 5-1 on Monday in their last friendly before the World Cup.
Midfielder Ramires added the other two goals, his first for Brazil.
Kaka, who suffered niggling injuries in a frustrating first season at Real Madrid, netted his first international goal in nearly a year.
He played the full 90 minutes and produced several characteristic bursts from midfield in an encouraging performance.
The last team to score against the five-times world champions was Bolivia in October.
The visitors were without Julio Cesar in their starting line-up for the first time in two years.
The Inter Milan goalkeeper was left out as a precaution after hurting his back in a 3-0 win over Zimbabwe.
Brazil went ahead after 10 minutes when Kaka set up Robinho to score with an angled shot.
The hosts created a couple of chances but Brazil rode the storm and made it 2-0 when Robinho tapped in from close range after a cross from Michel Bastos went across the face of the goal.
Brazil, who face North Korea, Ivory Coast and Portugal in their first-round group, extended their lead eight minutes after the restart when Ramires burst down the left to score.
Kaka added the fourth, scoring with his chest from Maicon's cross in the 76th minute, before Tanzania notched a consolation effort 10 minutes later as Jabir Aziz headed in from close range.
Ramires made it 5-1 by nodding in a Daniel Alves cross in injury time.
BOSTON - LeBron James should remain with the Cleveland Cavaliers and eschew the free-agent market for the good of the league, the community, and most of all, himself, Hall of Famer Dave Cowens said on Monday.
James will soon become a free agent and speculation on where the two-times MVP will land has triggered a spirited guessing-game across the North American sporting landscape.
Cowens, a seven-times All-Star power forward with the Boston Celtics during the 1970s-80s, said he hoped James would try to win the NBA championship with the Cavaliers.
James will become a free agent next month and fans of several major-market clubs, especially New York, Chicago, and Miami, are hoping the Cleveland-area native jumps ship.
The 25-year-old has been with the Cavaliers for his entire seven-year NBA career and remains searching for his first championship.
Cleveland had the league's best record this season (61-21) but were bounced in the second round of the playoffs by the Celtics.
The Cavaliers also made the NBA Finals in 2007 only to be swept by San Antonio.
Cowens, 61, said the Celtics and the Lakers, the NBA teams with the most titles, have a tradition of keeping players throughout their careers and James should take note.
MILAN - Jose Mourinho said he hoped to sprinkle some of his magic over Real Madrid when he was unveiled as the Spanish giants' new coach on Monday.
The Portuguese joins Real on a four-year deal in the wake of leading Inter Milan to an historic treble of successes in Italy's Serie A championship, the Italian Cup and Champions League.
Mourinho made his name when he led FC Porto to the Champions League title in 2004.
A hugely successful spell followed at Chelsea and despite leaving the club before it went on to lose the 2008 final to Manchester United, he resurrected his career with Inter.
His two-year spell at the Serie A side has left him as one of the most in-demand coaches in football.
And the no-nonsense Portuguese said he was confident he can bring similar success to Real during his four-year spell at the Santiago Bernabeu.
Mourinho said little about what changes, if any, he would bring to the squad, placing his focus on the need to forge a winning identity throughout the club.

MADRID - Spanish tennis ace Rafael Nadal is hoping his troublesome knee injury won't stop him enjoying a good performance in this year's Madrid Open tennis tournament.
Rafael Nadal of Spain hits a return to his compatriot David Ferrer during their final match at the Rome Masters tennis tournament in Rome May 2, 2010.

The competition begins on Monday and the world number three is looking forward to receiving the warm support he usually gets in the Spanish capital.
Spanish players, who traditionally play better on slow beaten clay courts, tend not to enjoy Madrid, where the altitude at 800 meters above sea level makes the ball faster through the air than their style of play is suited to.
Nadal agrees with that assessment.

NEW YORK - Breaking up your fitness routine is hard to do.
But it's crucial for avoiding the bigger heartache of overuse injury, fitness experts say.
Yet she concedes that even clients who complain of nagging aches and pains are loath to change their routine.
For Adrian Shepard, fitness director for the recreation department at Butler University, over-exercisers can suffer more than pain or poor performance.
Shepard says some young adults he works with at the Butler campus in Indianapolis, Indiana, are especially vulnerable.
He stresses the importance of consulting a fitness professional.
Dr. Heather Gillespie, of the American College of Sports Medicine, sees everyone from elite athletes to weekend warriors in her sports medicine practice at UCLA.
She said the consequences of over-exercising can include stress fractures as well as overuse injuries.
For them she recommends strength training.
She suggests varying routines and taking time to recover.
She acknowledges the difficulty of prying even an injured addict away from his activity.
Coopersmith urges all who work out to seek professional advice.

When ICBC went public, queues at bank branches went out the door and around the corner, with police and security called in to maintain order, but the offering of China's largest bank by assets came during a bull market.
But that has not completely deterred retail investors, who are allowed to subscribe to at least 5 percent of the Hong Kong IPO and as much as 15 percent depending on demand.
For institutional investors seeking China exposure and a lift for their portfolios, the jury is still out on ABC.
Global markets are dropping along with China's stock market, on liquidity concerns, the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and other factors.
Corporations known as cornerstone investors have bought up more than $5 billion of the Hong Kong offering already, a deal aimed at raising up to $11.
4 billion excluding a 15 percent over-allotment of shares.
The Shanghai deal is aimed at raising just under that amount.
Standard Chartered Plc will invest $500 million as a cornerstone investor in the Hong Kong offering, the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday.
Mutual funds are expected to be highly interested in the stock, although a Reuters poll indicated that any price above 1.
5 times book value would be perceived as expensive.
Individual investors seem undeterred however, despite a more muted turnout that other Hong Kong IPOs.
China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) will do its best to reduce the impact of a crude oil pipeline explosion in Dalian, a port city in northeast China's Liaoning Province, CNPC told Xinhua Sunday.
The fire has been extinguished and no casualties have been reported, according to CNPC, China's largest oil and gas producer and supplier.
Oil has stopped leaking into the sea as a valve has been closed.
The oil that entered the sea has been fenced off and contained, CNPC said.
Monitoring of the air and sea environment has been stepped up in the affected areas, CNPC added.
An explosion hit an oil pipeline of 0.
9 meter in diameter at 6: 20 p. m. Friday and triggered an adjacent smaller pipeline to explode near Dalian's Xingang Harbor.
Both pipelines, owned by China National Petroleum Corp. , caught fire.
The blaze of the larger pipeline was extinguished around midnight Friday, but at least five subsequent explosions worsened the fire on the smaller pipeline.
The flames that engulfed Dalian wasn't extinguished until Saturday morning, 15 hours after blasts hit two oil pipelines.
The company will cooperate with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, spokesman Zhao Jugang said by phone today.
Zijin, which had initially blamed rains for the July 3 leak at its copper smelter near Shanghang county, delayed disclosure of the incident for nine days.
Zijin, based in Fujian province, dropped 12 percent on July 13 after the announcement to the lowest level in more than 15 months in Hong Kong trading.
In Shanghai trading, the stock fell 3.
3 percent to 5.
57 yuan at 9: 44 am.
Zijin plans to spend 200 million yuan on environmental and risks measures within a year as part of its restructuring plan after the incident, Zhao said.
The plant produces 12, 800 metric tons of copper a year, and will only reopen after checks by environmental authorities.
A restart may not take place for at least six months, the South China Morning Post reported today, citing company secretary Zheng Yuqiang.
Zheng today denied making those comments.
The company can't determine when it can reopen the plant because that's dependent on the conclusion of various government investigations, Zhao said today.

Sichuan Airlines' investment of 400 million yuan ($59 million) in the struggling Northeast Airlines was approved by the Sichuan Provincial State Assets Management Committee on Wednesday.
It marked the takeover by Sichuan Airlines of Northeast Airlines, the first airline based in Northeast China.
The 400 million yuan investment accounts for 97 percent of equity interest in the troubled airline, with the remaining 3 percent held by the Shenyang branch of Zhongrui Investment Ltd, its former owner.
After the takeover, the registered capital of Northeast Airlines registers at 460 million yuan ($68 million).
Set up on Nov 8, 2007, Northeast Airlines went downhill shortly after that.
As one of its stockholders, Sichuan had greatly supported three of its passenger airliners, as well as the company's introduction of talent and foreign airliners.
Sichuan Airlines is planning to restructure Northeast Airlines and establish New Hebei Airlines, together with its partner, the State-owned Jizhong Energy Group in Hebei province.
A cooperative agreement between the two was signed on March 18.
New Hebei Airlines will be formally established on June 29, using the logo of a capitalized J resembling a soaring eagle.
According to Sichuan Airlines, the letter J is the abbreviation for Ji, the alternative name of Hebei province, and the eagle represents the soaring ambition of the new airline.
DALIAN: The first environment equities exchange in northeast China - the eighth nationwide - opened Wednesday.
It is mainly served as an international market to trade environmental technologies, pollutant emissions, energy performance contracts and carbon dioxide emissions, based on the government-certified emission standards, said Wang Weidong, chairman of the exchange.
It was a platform for buyers and sellers with environmental trade needs, based purely on supply and demand as with a property rights exchange, and hopefully would see its first transactions within the month, said Wang.
The international carbon emissions trade has witnessed a rapid growth over the past five years.
It surged 31 percent year on year to 48 billion tons in 2008, seven times more than the volume in 2005.
However, the environment trade market in China was challenged by low public recognition and unformed pricing systems, said Zhang Xingwen, of Dalian University of Technology.

After Oil Spill Larger ships can be diverted to Shandong Ports \nAn explosion on July 16 in the Xingang zone at Dalian Port, which operates the nation`s largest crude terminal, damaged oil pipelines and caused a slick that blanketed nearby seawater.

Though the tiny size of diesel exhaust particles may contribute to their ability to penetrate all areas of the body, Sun noted that their complex chemical composition, and the way in which those chemicals are released once particles enter the body, also influence how they react with human cells.
Gasoline exhaust particles are larger than diesel fume particles, but it's premature to suggest that they are any less dangerous to humans, Sun said.
Sun and colleagues are now conducting a study testing whether the exhaust particles promote tumor development and metastasis.
This work is supported by Health Effects Institute awards and grants from the National Institutes of Health.

EURO DOWN\nInvestors fled peripheral euro zone government stocks and bonds last week because of doubts about how the euro rescue mechanism would work and worries about the solvency of European banks exposed to the sovereign debt crisis.
World share prices dipped further on Monday.
U. S. stocks closed lower in thin volume, and the euro fell below $1.
20 for the first time in more than four years.
Concern about political stability in Spain, one of the troubled euro zone economies, fed market anxiety.
Juncker and Rehn said they were more concerned by the pace of the euro's decline than by the lower exchange rate, and the IMF said a currency long seen by many as too strong was now closer to what economic fundamentals justified.
Germany needs less than others to slow spending but, keen to set an example, will pursue savings of 30 billion euros over four years in welfare, mainly from unemployment benefits, and will cut thousands of federal government jobs.
The new savings are unlikely to please some of Germany's partners, including the United States, which pressured Berlin at a G20 meeting in South Korea to stimulate domestic demand.
Despite the efforts in Luxembourg to reassure markets, German Chancellor Angela Merkel postponed talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy on reforming governance of the euro zone.
Officials cited diary problems.
The two had been due to patch up their differences over the euro zone and financial regulation, 10 days before an EU summit.
The meeting will take place next Monday, German officials said.

However, there are recovery opportunities for Macao's economy this year, said Tam, adding that he expected stable economic growth for Macao this year as long as no major unfavorable incidents occurred.

Workers, many of them migrants from poor villages, say their wages have not kept up with rising prices or the profits reaped by companies using China as a low-cost production base.
No specific law in China defines strikes as legal or illegal, but it is clear that authorities discourage such activity.
However, those who have been taking the risks have been winning rewards.
Those in Pingmian Textile Group factory in Central China also got a 25-percent pay hike after a two-week strike.
Liu Kaiming, the executive director of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, said the government should remain neutral whenever there is friction between management and workers.
Kan, a former health minister once known for battling bureaucrats, has forged an image as a fiscal conservative and occasional central bank critic since assuming the finance post in January.
If he becomes premier, that could spell bolder steps to rein in the huge public debt, although he would face opposition from many in his party ahead of the election.
He is expected to form a new cabinet later the same day.
The Democrats swept to power in a historic election last year and will run the government whatever the outcome of the July upper house poll, but the ruling bloc needs to win a majority in that chamber to ensure that legislation is enacted smoothly.
Media surveys showed Hatoyama's resignation had given the party a boost.
In an Asahi newspaper poll, 28 percent of voters said they planned to cast their ballots for the Democrats against 20 percent for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, ousted last year after more than 50 years of almost non-stop rule.
That compared to 20 percent who favoured the DPJ in previous survey.
A Yomiuri newspaper poll also showed a similar boost in voter support for the Democrats in next month's upper house election.
Kan, known for his short temper, became Japan's most popular politician for a time when he battled bureaucrats as health minister in 1996 to expose a scandal over HIV-tainted blood products.
Yemen became a focus of deep international concern in December when al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the failed attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner, showing the group based in an impoverished and unstable corner of the Middle East had global reach.
The warning said such attacks could be similar to the 2000 strike against the Navy destroyer USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbor that killed 17 American sailors.
The attackers used a small boat laden with explosives to blow a hole in the side of the ship.
In particular, ships are at greatest risk while in or near ports or at anchor, it said.
The statement advised vessels in the waterway leading to and from the Suez Canal to maintain 24-hour visual and radar watches and regularly report their position, course and speed to maritime authorities.
Besides an al-Qaida threat, ships transiting the area have been beset by Somali pirates who have seized control of vessels ranging from fishing trawlers to oil supertankers in search of ransoms in the millions of dollars.

5 million Armenians in Ottoman Turkey during World War I from being labeled a genocide.
But relations with Israel have been deteriorating steadily since Israel's Gaza war.
Erdogan walked off the stage at the World Economic Forum last year after berating Israel's President Shimon Peres over the Gaza war.
In January, Turkish Ambassador Oguz Celikkol was forced to sit on a low sofa and was not greeted with a handshake during a meeting in Israel with Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, who later apologized.
Turkey has since begun backing Iran's attempts to quash new UN sanctions over its nuclear program, another irritant in relations with the US and Israel.
The Gaza aid flotilla was organized by an Istanbul-based Islamic charity under the unofficial auspices of the Turkish government.
Turkey sent planes to pick up its wounded after refusing an Israeli offer to bring them home.
CALCUTTA, India: A cyclone demolished thousands of mud huts and uprooted trees in several villages in eastern India, killing at least 31 people, an official said Wednesday.

The worst-hit villages were Hematabad, Raiganj and Kiran Dighi, where police and rescue have recovered 31 bodies, Mukherjee told The Associated Press.
The cyclone demolished nearly 50, 000 mud huts, he said.
BEIJING: Animal feed and feed additive companies are obliged to immediately recall products upon discovery of any defect that may result in harm to animals or people, a draft regulation made public Saturday said.
The draft of a revised regulation on the administration of animal feed and feed additives is designed to meet increased public demand for better animal product food quality and safety, according to the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, China's cabinet.
The office and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly drafted the revised regulation.
It is now open to public comment.
The draft also imposes tougher punishment for abusive use of animal feed or feed additives.
Animal farming businesses may be fined as much as 50, 000 yuan ($7, 320) if they are found to have uses feed or feed additives forbidden or not included in the catalogue of approved items, the draft said.
The public is invited to comment on the draft before March 15 through online postings, email or letter.
The draft is available on the official website of the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, www.

The current Regulations on Administration of Animal Feed and Feed Additives took effect in May 1999, and was amended in November 2001.
Some of the troops wielded paintball rifles -- non-lethal weapons designed to bruise, beat back and mark suspects for later arrest, but which apparently proved of limited use against activists who had the protection of life-jackets and gas masks.
There was little question of calling off the raid once the first Israelis were in the fight and vulnerable, though the navy said some commandos opted to escape by jumping overboard.
Israel said seven marines were injured, one after activists pitched him over a railing and two with gunshot wounds, possibly from backup pistols that were wrested away from them.
Some experts questioned whether a police anti-riot unit might have tackled the resistance with less bloodshed.
But an Israeli Defense official said only marines were capable of the takeover 120 km (75 miles) in the choppy Mediterranean, timed for darkness to surprise the activists and deprive attendant journalists of spectacular pictures.
He hinted Israel had exhausted covert means of stalling the Mavi Marmara and five other vessels in a flotilla that sailed for Gaza in defiance of an Israeli campaign to isolate the Hamas Islamists who rule the Palestinian territory.
The woman with the best chance to beat Venus Williams at Key Biscayne watched the women's quarterfinals from the photo pit.
Serena Williams had no camera but used her connections to secure a front-row seat as she watched her sister beat Radwanska.
Top-ranked Serena has been sidelined by a knee injury since winning the Australian Open in January.
In her absence, Venus has become the woman to beat as she bids for her fourth Key Biscayne title and her first since 2001.
In the men's fourth round, American Mardy Fish retired with a sciatic nerve injury trailing Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 6-1, 1-0.
The injury occurred when Fish took a tumble in the first set, causing discomfort from his back to his calf.
No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France earned a shot at Nadal on Wednesday by beating No. 12 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2, 6-2.
The fourth-seeded Nadal, seeking his first Key Biscayne championship and his first title anywhere in 10 months, punctuated his win over Ferrer with a nifty leg kick-uppercut combination.
The No. 3-seeded Williams hit eight aces and lost only five points on her first serve.
She broke five times, including in the pivotal eighth game, when Radwanska had consecutive double-faults and then hit a 62-mph knuckleball serve that Williams pounced on to whack a winner.
BEIJING -- A senior official of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said Saturday that news reporting on the Yushu earthquake relief efforts should be timely, accurate, comprehensive and objective.

QINGDAO, Shandong-- A large expanse of green algae is floating towards east China's coastline, an oceanic official said Tuesday.
The green algae, namely enteromorpha prolifera, presently covers about 200 square kilometers of sea off China's Shandong Province.
The green mass is about 13 kilometers from Jiaonan city and 16 km from Dagong Island, according to the North China Sea Branch (NCSB) of the State Oceanic Administration.
The NCSB first detected the green expanse in the sea off the coast of Rizhao city in Shandong last Monday and since it has continued to drift north.
It would move northward, according the sea's flow, at a speed of 7-9 kilometers per day and would come closer to the coastline, said Liu Fenglin, spokeswoman of NCSB.
The NCSB has started an emergency response.
Local governments have dispatched vessels to clear the algae from the sea.
Though not poisonous and with no affect on water quality, the algae can consume large amounts of oxygen, threatening marine life, according to Pang Shaojun, professor of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
If the green algae was not cleaned in time, it could affect the development of the tourism sector in the coastal area as the rotten algae emits a foul smell, according to Pang.
Green algae emerged in the Yellow Sea in 2007.
Local residents and soldiers removed tens of thousands of tonnes of the algae in 2008 before the Beijing Olympics' sailing competitions kicked off in Qingdao of Shandong.

The businesses of salt, tea, wood, and dock shop attracted most Hui merchants.
As well, grain, cotton cloth, silk, paper, ink, and porcelain were also popular in Hui-owned shops.
Besides making money by selling those goods, some Hui merchants went outside their hometown and set up factories.
The flexible Hui merchants were apt to adjust their business strategies against the changes in the market.
Talents were regarded as an important role in the competition, which unfortunately remained to be neglected by most of the then merchants in other areas in China.
Hui merchants believed sincerely in honesty and morality.
Actually, the belief became one of their important means to make profit.
They were diligent and famous for their extraordinary endurance.
Some left their hometown to seek business chances right after their wedding and could find time to return only some three years later.
Hui merchants were distinctly attached to bureaucracy.
Following their success in business, Hui merchants tended to establish close relations with officials to make the business more smooth and prosperous.
Some sent their sons to sit in imperial examinations, which provided access to political positions in the government.
The eclipse of the Hui merchants\nThe traditional production fell far behind when the western technological civilization intruded upon China.
Take the tea merchants as an example.
Their tea products had been quite popular in the international market for few countries had the capability to process the tea.
But the merchants who became rich out of the tea trade did not come back to enlarge the factory and upgrade the technology.
Instead, they bought larger land and rebuilt their houses.
However, the tea factories in foreign countries that adopted new technology began to compete with Chinese tea merchants.
Without the burden of tariff, local tea producers in foreign countries were usually in an advantageous position in the competition.

2 meters above sea level, the highest in East Anhui.
On its top stands a beacon tower erected in the Southern Tang Dynasty (937-975), although what we can see today is only a four-storey tower-like building, with a height of some 10 meters.
Such a building was used to watch for the distant fire signal in ancient times.

According to some experts, besides water erosion, the roots of trees and the soil have also contributed to the formation of the gullies.
Jagged or whorly rocks are found all over this area, in which grow many plants.
The whole scenic area has about 267 hectares which can be developed, although only about 7 hectares have been developed so far.
