You will have healthy white teeth.
Please don't eat too much fat and sugar foods .
Because of this, you will put very easily .
For example, in some parts of Britain, one person in ten, by the age of thirty, has no teeth left!
I advise people not to have hamburger.
The foods that you buy in hamburger restaurants are high in fat, sugar and salt.
They are not a healthy diet.
Look at this cup of coca cola.
There is as much sugar in it as eight pieces of sugar.
Sugar is not a necessary part of a healthy diet.
YANG RONG A HEALTHY DIET
People get energy from food.
What kind of diet should we need?
In our text book, the author thinks a healthy diet must be rich in vegetable, fiber low in fat and sugar.
This is a popular point of view in most of people .
But I don't agree with them.
Sugar and fat are the most important energy.
If you take a little you will find there is not enough power in your body.
Old men, adults, teenagers, children and babies need different amount of energy.
Teenagers and adults need the most of all.
Children need more than old men and babies .
Because of this, old men and babies should have a diet as our text says.
They don't put on weight.
As they do more exercises and often think deeply.
If they take less fat and sugar, they would have less power.
And it will affect their future.
Don't worry about put on weight or bad teeth.
Bad teeth are not by the food .
Now you must know hamburger is not so bad.
It's rich in fat and sugar.
It has less vegetable and fiber than normal meal.
But it's fast food.
Most of people need fast food who are busy in their works.
So do not believe doctor's words at all.
You must choose the right kind of a healthy diet .

I just know the reason for me to study is " knowledge is power".
Every time when I talk to my aunt (she's Englishwoman).
I always feel it's difficult to make her know what I say " I'm poor in English" I think, " I can't talk to my aunt and my lovely cousins, I don't understand that what they think about.
" I found English is quite important and useful to me.
Tomorrow will come, tomorrow will go.
And tomorrow will be a new beginning.
Everything goes well.
I hope!
When I was Ill
Winter Holiday is coming.
I am so happy.
Finished the busy living, coming to the free living.
The first day in my holiday I was ill. That was a very bad ill.
In that week my mother was toilsome.
She took care of me everyday.
She comforted me, took good care of me.
I found very affected.
Remember, when I was a little child, my mother took care of me like that.
My mother is very fond of me.
Because my mother is very fond of me.
I love my mother.
I am fond of my mother, too!
Thank you, mommy!
Thank you very much!
I love you forever!
My lovely mommy!
Hi!
I love this holiday.
The seasons
Today I will talk about the seasons.
There are four seasons in a year, and the seasons are quite different.
But if let me choose the seasons, I choose winter, because I was born at that time, it doesn't like summer so hot, and we can play snow.
That is interesting.
It was about five o'clock in the morning.
It was dark outside.
At this time, it looked something fall down, what was this?
Oh, it was the snow.
The snow was very thick and the weather was very cold.
The street was looked like longer than yesterday.
This time, you can only see one thing--- snow.
It was falling down.
If you saw one or two people.
Their eyebrows were all white.
Because the snow was on it.
There weren't leaves on the tree, only some snow.
I had a happy day.
In that day, I was go to pay new year visits with my father.
I was very very glad.
Because at night, outside the White Swarm Hotel.
There are a beautiful Show.
It's wonderful.
When I had dinner.
I can seeing show.
I had so much lucky money from the relatives.
One day, mother asked me help her do some house- work.
It's nothing in the floor except the dust.
Mother said: " You're grow to manhood.
"
My Dreams
A dream for a young girl is very wonderful!
Like me, I have many nice dreams.
I want to be a clever lawyer, an outstanding pianist, or do something I like.If I am a lawyer.
I must be talkative.
And I must try my best to help the kind persons.
I like this occupation.
Because I can help the people who is in trouble.
They are very poor, I think.
If they are helped by me, they must be very happy.
It's also a good job.
Or I will be a pianist.
It's such an artistic job!
If I am not famous, it doesn't matter, I don't mind this.
Because I only seek nature and truth.
That's enough.
So the best musical country is liked by me.
It's Austria.
Austria is a very beautiful country is liked by me.
It's Mozart's hometown.
The scenery in Austria is also very charming.
So studying abroad in Austria is my dream.
I want to be a student there.
Dreams are only dreams.
I only study hard for my dreams.
They will come true.
Lin Zi A wish
One night of winter holiday.
I was so upset.
Why?
Listened : " Get down, get down, and move it all around, get down, get *!
But,I think I won't accomplish anything by hollering at them.
Well, Okay, forget it.
I am sure they will be quiet in the future.

My favourite sport is football.
I have played football for four years.
I also have been in my class team.
Play football is necessary power and swift.
I'm sorry that you are not happy yet in your school.
They could help you.
You said you didn't know how to lose weight quickly.
Because they can make you fat.
And you must have sports.
With best wishes Doctor.
Four people are planning a bicycle trip from Beijing to London.
The trip is about 20,000 kilometres.
Four people are come from China, Australia, Greece, Britain.
After the ball, Mathilde looked down and saw that the necklace was not around her neck any more, they couldn't find it, it was lost.
During the next ten years, they both worked day and night to pay back the money they had borrowed.
Mathilde met Jeanne again, she had changed so much older her friend couldn't recognize her.
Her friend told her that necklace wasn't a real diamond necklace.
They can do all kinds of jobs.
They do well on some way.
But on some way they don't do better than man.
In the battlefield, the men forever in front of the women.
Women can't do this job.
The women also have merit.
They are very kind for children.
....
Ma Ling, I hope you are very well.
At first, don't worry about being short and fat.
Then you will be happy.
In my opinion, lose weight quickly are not the most important.
Because your are sixteen years old, now.
It is the most important stage of your grow up.
I suggest you don't eat sweet food much, but not at all.
Like running, riding, jumping and so on.
Then they can restrain your weight become more and more, and lose weight slowly.
If you in the light of my said.
I think you will succeed.
With Best wishes.
Doctor
Because she and her husband were invited to the ball at the Palace.
The next after of the ball, Mathilds bought a new necklace for Jeanne.
Ten years later, Mathilde and her husband at last paid back all the money.
Mathilde met Jeanne in a park, she told Jeanne all her story.
It wasn't valuable at all.
I think, women's life is as happy as man.
They think that it isn't he important that he is a boy or a girl.
The important is a good child.
Because a girl is the same as a boy.

Dear Wang Ning, Thank you for writing to me.
You said you had wanted to know about the differences between American English and British English.
The English language we know today is about six hundred years old.
For half that time, English was just the language of the English living in England.
The modern English language grew by about the year 1400.
Many words were borrowed from French and Germany.
At first, the languages staged the same as those in Europe, but slowly they began to grow apart.
Today, the differences between American English and British English are not very great.
Written English is more or less the same in both Britain and America, though there are some spelling differences.
But people from the two countries can understand each other easily.
Though the English passed their language on to North America, these days, the British have borrowed a lot of new words from the Americans, such as teenager, boyfriend, radio, football, fan, right away(at once), way of life, and so on.
There are only a very small number of differences in grammar between American English and British English.
The most important differences are in spoken English.
You may wonder "which is correct?
" The answer is that it does not matter.
But you should speak either American English or British English.
Do not try to speak both at the same time!
Best wishes!
Yours, Mr Lan

Women's Day There is a women's Day in China.

On that day you will find all kinds of pretty women over the city.
There is not enough land by the sea.
The population is growing every minute.
Many people can not find work in the capital.
They are moving into the forests until they come to a forest.
The farmers don't stay along in the same place.
They move on to a new place every two or three years.
Because the soil is very thin in the forest.
People can only grow crops in the forest for one or two years.

George was a clever newspaper man.
He argued with anybody and about anything.
He knew he could never make them change their mind, because they could not really understand what he was saying.
He found those foolish people were always sure that they were right and they often said very interesting things.
" George thought it was interesting, and he never forgot it.
LEARNING A LANGUAGE
We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children.
If we could learn a second language in the sane way, it would not seem so difficult.
Think of what a child does.
When it wants something, it has to ask for it.
It is talking in it and thinking in it all the time.
It is important to remember, also, that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it, not by seeing what they write.
We imitate what we hear.
There is no easy way to success in language learning.
Practice is important we must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can.
And we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.
HAPPY NEW YEAR

TRY TO USE ENGLISH
A student's mastery of English .
Writing English journals is the best way to improve your writing.
OUR FACTORY
It is on the bank of the Jialing River.
We keep our products there before we ship them away.
Very often we have to put some of the products in the open air, for there isn't enough room in the store houses.
We make all kinds of farm machines -walking tractors, rice-field tractors, water pumps and many others.
We make small farm tools, too.
The factory owns a pier at the river bank.
Products for other places go by train.
But there are some old workers, too.
The other is a middle-aged woman.
The old workers give the young ones a lot of help in their work.
During the lunch break people like to go there for a rest, they play cards, listen to the radio or just have a smoke.
Many young workers prefer to play basketball for half an hour before they start work again at 1:30 in the afternoon.
We all work very hard.
WATCHING TV
My classmates and I often talked about the stories after class.
Soon, I became a middle school student, I found that I had lost interest in these children programmes.
Instead , I was interested in the news programmes of CCTV.
I always sat in front of the TV set until all the programmes were over.
My parents began to worry about me and I also felt my eye sight failing I knew I spent too much time in watching TV.
I will not miss it.
MY HOMETOWN

Many people keep a dog for pleasure.
We should take good care of them.
THOUGHTS OF A SPEECH
Her speech wasn't only easy and smooth but also full of her feeling.
Zhan Shanshan was my old classmate.
When I was in junior middle school .
We were in the same class.
I could remember, we once had taken part in an English competition.
And I did better than her.
So I was very happy.
In my opinion, in future the society will need the persons who have ability.
The 2 parts are both important.
FATHER
He always works for my family every day.
I only hope me to grow faster.
Then I can let him have a rest.
In an art book, there is a picture called "father ".
A PAIR OF TROUSERS
He found that they were about two inches too long.
Would one of you mind doing this for me, please ?
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches.
She ran upstairs with her scissors, needle; and thread, and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers.
SELLING BOOKS
It's worth one yuan at the most.
" She said.
I didn't know what to say.
Looking at her .
I said to myself, " I must be braver next time.
" I asked with a smile.
"Ah, I want this cartoon book.
" He said.
I'll tell you a true story.
It happened in my hometown.
There is a clean river in the village.
But people are very poor.
Children have to do a lot of housework so that their parents can go to fields and grow crops.
The girl asked her mother for money.
At first, I thought she wasn't a good girl.
I heard "Mother, I want to go to school.
I'm fond of studying.
I really want to go to school.
I prefer not to eat lunch in order to go to school.
I know that you learned very well.
I can't give little money to you to go to school.
" The mother said and cried.
So I tell the story to you.
FISHING
Some years ago we often went fishing by a small river ten kilometers away from my hometown.
Many fishing fans used to go there for a good catch.
We set off very early that morning.
At about seven o'clock we got to the river.
We couldn't find any people there.
After we got our fishing-tackle .
We began to fish.
More than two hours passed but still no fish was caught.
MY YOUNG FRIEND
Later I got to know from my father that he was dumb.
Though he couldn't talk to me, we got on well with each other.
I thought he must be unhappy to live in a world without any sound.
He had grown much taller.
He invited me to his home.
He "told" me with sign language that he loved his school very much.
The teacher treated them as their own children.
With their help , he could write and read now.
He showed me a green box.
It was the prize he got in a drawing competition.
SELLING BOOKS
I got 63 books from my classmates to the open air behind our new teaching- building.
"Hi How much is this book -Beautiful friend?
" I answered shyly.
" She said.
I didn't know what to say.
After all it's my first time to be a seller!
" Just then a boy with glasses came up.

How wonderful!
HONG KONG
It is in the past of Hong Kong.
called Kowloon.
Kowloon is one of the two big cities in Hong Kong.
It is on the land.
The other city is Hong Kong itself.
It is on an island.
Most of them are Chinese.
Many grown-ups are doing so in their spare time.
Everybody knows his own language, but to know another is very useful.
Which is the best way to learn a language?
We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children.
If we could learn a second language in the same way, it would not seem so difficult.
Think of what a child does.
When it wants something, it has to ask for it.
It is talking in it and thinking in it all the time.
It is important to remember, also, that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it , not by seeing what they write.
We imitate what we hear.
In school , though you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak , it is best to learn all new words through the ear.
Of course, you must learn to read them, spell them , and write them, too.
There is no easy way to success in language learning.
A good memory is a great help.
It is not such used learning by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on.
We must learn by using the language.
If we are satisfied with a few rules we have memorized, we are not really learning the language.
" Learn through practice" is a piece of good advice for those who are learning a new language.
We learn to swim by getting into the water and swimming.
FISHING
But what we saw there surprised us very much.
After we got out our fishing-tackle, we began to fish.
More than two hours passed but still no fish was caught.
At last we couldn't stand the terrible smell any longer and had to go home.
AN INTERESTING English Party
All of our grade students took part in the English Party.At 3:00 in the afternoon .

The English party lasted two hours.
It was over successfully.
It was a good place where we studied English.

People made a rule to protect the nature.
you will be punished.Now, the river is turned green again.
The fish begin to appear in the river, too.
When you get up.
you can live in the clean air.
I hope it's always like this.

English is one of the most important .
languages because so many people use it not only in England and America, but in other countries of the world.
About 320,000,000 speak it as their own language, and another 200,000,000 use it as a second language.
It is difficult to say how many people are learning it.
French is also a very important language.
Some children study German.
We know that we all learnt our own language well when we were children.
We learn a second language in the same way.
It won't seem so difficult.
How does a small child ?
It listens to what people say and it tries to guess what it hears.
it has to ask for it.
In school, you learn to read to write to hear and to speak.
WATER
Man also needs water.
We need water to drink to cook food and to clean ourselves.
Water is needed in offices.
Factories and schools .
Where else is water needed?
There is water in seas.
rivers and lakes.
Even in the driest part of the world there is some water in the air.
The water in seas, rivers and lakes is a liquid.
May be a solid, or a liquid, or a gas .
When it is a liquid, you can pour it out of a cup when it is a gas, you cannot see it or feel it.

I was a little afraid of him.
I hesitated for a moment before I pushed the door.
"I am very sorry, Mr Wu, I am late, again.
" I said with a red face.
"Oh , it's you again.
" Mr Wu said sternly.
"I've told you not to be late but you......" he suddenly stopped and looked at my wet clothes.
He turned to the class and said," I'm very sorry my boys and girls.
VISITING MR WANG
Mr Wang was my English teacher.
But I found idioms and useful expressions hard to learn.
So I had a talk with Mr Wang about learning English.
I asked.
"Excuse me, Mr Wang.
I couldn't use it freely.
"Mr Wang smiled and said.
""I don't think so.
" I said.
Marx gave some advice on how to learn a foreign language.
He said when people are learning a foreign language .
They should not translate everything into their own language.
" After the talk, I found my English study was improving.
I'm sure that I can make great progress.

At the party, I had a programme to perform.
I felt that my heart beat so fast.
I began to sing.
Looking at them, my heart began beating not so fast.
Afterwards, my classmates all stood up.
I thanked them very much.
I felt our class was so warm.
Nov. 26 Sunday Sunny
Please cherish your eyes Eyes are the windows of soul for people.
They are the most expensive for us.
You'll have a lot of trouble if you are not able to see .
Because if you are blind, you must depend on your ears or hands.
So we must cherish our eyes.
Ordinarily, we must not read in a dark place, and don't read in the sun, and don't read when we are walking, and don't read in bed.
Besides, we must do the setting-up exercises of eyes earnestly.
A pair of normal eyes is very important for us.
I hope everyone will have a pair of normal eyes.
Dec. 3 Sunday Sunny
I love all the fine things in the world.
I have joined the calligraphy match in the art festival.
And the result was not bad.
When the photos have been developed, I found that my friend 's photos were better than mine.
For I'm a common person, I was unhappy in the heart of course.
However, I had straightened out my thinking after all.
It's good that I dare to join the match.
And I should be pleased that my friend's photos are good.
Dec. 10 Sunday Sunny
Today, I opened the newspaper and read an interesting news.
It said a lady only spent 7 American dollars for her wedding dress and veil.
He wore the uniform of cleaning squad proudly, and held wedding in a city.
The mayor took charge of the wedding.
There's point in making wedding dress with rubbish sack.
Air was polluted these days.
It's necessary for us to protect the environment.
It's the duty of everyone.
Dec. 17 Sunday Rainy
Once there lived an Emperor.
He liked fine new clothes most.
Two cheats knew this, then they were going to cheat the Emperor.
They told the Emperor that they could weave the best cloth in the world.
So he gave the cheats some gold in order that they might begin their work at once.
Though they praised the cloth to the Emperor.
Because they thought they mustn't let the Emperor know they were stupid or unfit for their office.
They all could see nothing.
The day which had a procession came.
Finally, everyone was saying, "BUT HE HAS NOTHING ON!
But he still went on for the procession.
And the two officials still held up the train of the robe that wasn't there at all.
Dec. 24 Sunday Sunny
Christmas comes again.
And there's no pattern on it.
I was unhappy recently.
And in any case, she is my best friend for ever.
And she told me to forget the unhappy things, everyone ought to be happy in this world...
Yesterday, we heart-to-heart talked together.
And then went shopping.
I'm sure our friendship will never die.
I devoutly bless my best friend will be happiness for ever.
Sunday.
Jan. 7.
Sunny
I like it very much.
Light blue sea is my favourite.
You can fancy, the light yellow sand can be seen through the light blue gold seawater, and the two chairs.
And how romantic!
Won't anyone love it?
Dark blue sea is not so beautiful as light blue sea.
But it has its own graceful bearing.
It is a mature sea.
It is dark everywhere.
Perhaps you can see the sea in the moonlight.
But it's so dim.
Sea, the place which I yearn for is like a pretty girl.
And it will be a beauty for ever.
Jan. 12 Friday Cloudy
The Emperor's New Clothes
The procession finished.
The Emperor and the officials came back to the Palace.
the Emperor thought back the scene that happened just now, and felt very silly and angry.
Then he ordered the officials who had seen the "perfect new clothes" to wear that "new clothes" and walked in the Palace.
He thought, " I surely lost face just now!
People must think I'm a foolish man!
" He thought and thought.
Finally, he became mental because he thought too much.
And he was a very good emperor.
He turned from side to side in front of the mirror every day, and hummed, " I'm so foolish.
I'm so stupid..." March 10 Sunday Rainy I'm a voracious person.
Why I aid so?
Well, let me tell you.
When I was still a little girl, I understand that English is a kind of interesting language.
Because it's not our own language.
It's strange for me.
In those days, I was eager to learn English.
Then I grew up.
I like English songs.
And then I found Japanese songs were good, too.
So I hoped to learn Japanese.
Many people said, " French is the most beautiful language in the world.
" With this sentence, my mind is perturbed again for foreign languages.
After this, I became wishing to learn all the foreign languages.
But I regretted that I had no spare time to learn them.
When you finish reading my article, do you think I am a voracious girl?
March 17 Sunday Cloudy I have several idols.
Wang Faye has a good voice.
It sounds very clear and light .
And it's special.
I will be relaxed when I hear her songs.
She has not only actual strength , but also an outstanding surface.
Sometimes she combed her hair like the pineapple, wore the perspective dress.
Sometimes she cut the hair very short, then adhered some long hair.
And sometimes her attire is pure.
Someone had ever said Wang Faye had her own way unduly.
Because she was of uncertain whereabouts, and refused the visitations.
Though the reporter asked her again and again.
And then often "be missing".
It made me only can hear her new songs a little time.
Faye, I will always support you .
You must sing more good songs for us!
The girl's name was Sun Yi.
Sun Yi was an orphan.
When she was still a baby, an old woman adopted her.
Except Sun Yi's grandmother (the old woman), her foster parents didn't treat her well.
They are the old woman's daughter and son-in-law.
She was forced to go to the Buddhist nunnery when she was just thirteen years old!
Afterwards, she left there for continuing her studying.
But it's still very bumpy.
For studying, she went to Xin Jiang thousands of li away to attend school.
She sold blood to take the money.
And people recognized the worth of her.
At the same time, Sun Yi's grandmother died.
Sun Yi was very sad.
She told her grandmother, "I'll never live up to the kindness of you.
The famous magician David (How spell?
David bent over the "bed" which was made of metal on the stage.
Several persons locked him on the "bed" with 5 locks.
Then put some metallic board around him, and locked them like a box.
David stirred his feet.
Clapping was sounded.
Then David made the times flow backwards.
finally, David had restored.
Do you agree?
April 21 Sunday Cloudy
The Footprint
One day, when Robinson Crusoe was walking on the sands, he saw a mark of a man's foot in the sand.
But there was nobody on the sands except him.
He was very frightened at the footprint.
He went home at once.
And looking behind now and then.
Soon after, Crusoe's dog died.
He sometimes thought, "Did I make the footmark myself?
" So he decided to go back to see the footmark.
But he thought that it wasn't safe enough, so he went out and looked for a better hiding-place.
Finally, he found a cave with narrow entrance.
He went into it.
He hurried out into the daylight.
Crusoe stepped into the cave with a burning stick, and found out that two eyes he had seen was a dead goat's eyes.
He also found out there was a good hiding-place.
One day, Crusoe climbed up to his lookout.
He saw nine savages sitting round a fire on the shore.
There were two canoes near them.
It seemed that they were eating something.
As soon as the savages had gone, Crusoe fetched two guns from his home.
The two canoes were hardly able to see.
Youth
Youth is the bud on the branch in the gentle and soft spring.
It is full of fancy and hope, and it lets the young affection drift in the green world.
It is so lively, so fresh and cool, that can rinse your distress.
Youth is zeal that is permeated with the red leaves on the maple in the desolate autumn.
We are going to sing for youth.
Youth is the snow in the cold winter.
The Story Of William Tell
William Tell came to Altorf with his little son.
In that town, A pole was placed in the marketplace.
Because Switzerland was ruled by Austria.
People were ordered to bow before the pole which was placed Gessler's hat on.
William Tell knew about it, but he would not bow.
So he was caught to Gessler.
Gessler was very angry.
He thought out a cruel plan to punish Tell.
He ordered Tell to shoot at the apple which was on his own son's head one hundred paces away.
William's son was brave.
The apple was split in half.
My first teacher
People always said, "The first lover is unforgettable.
" I think the first teacher is unforgettable, too.
We called her Mrs. Jean.
Mrs Jean was tall, vigorous and serious.
We feared her very much.
At that time, we thought Mrs. Jean was partial.
When the boy monitor had made a mistake, she always didn't gave him a heavy punishment.
We thought that's unfair.
Afterwards, Mrs Jean went to another school.
On the contrary, we began missing her.
Then we went to see her on one Sunday.
We felt Mrs. Jean was affectionate in fact.
But Mrs. Jean had been away.
We had to bless her far away.
The senseless cheap trick The day before yesterday, I heard from a letter.
At first, I was very surprised.
Who would write to me?
I opened it.
Oh, it was the cheap trick which had continued for several years.
It said he (she) is .
It was very lucky that I received the letter.
He (she) asked me to make 20 carbon copies and send them to my friends in 9 days.
Some of them copied and sent the letters.
But they hadn't got rich.
But they are all right all along.
I don't know why the people thought of such a cheap trick.
But I think these people are senseless.
I wish they won't do that again.
At he same time, I hope no one will be silly to copy these letters.
Suddenly, his sword slipped down from the sheath, then dropped into the river.
The man carved a mark on the boat immediately and said, 'My sword dropped from here.
" The boat reached the other side of the river.
It stopped.
And the boat was moving.
So we mustn't stick to conventions.
Then we will be clever boys and girls.
Because I went to a place where I wished to go--Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is an island.
It is very prosperous.
It has not only a very big seascape, but so many tall buildings.
At night, they are very beautiful.
How wonderful!
The famous Ocean Park is quite amusing.
In the Marine Land, you can see kinds of fishes.
Besides, you can visit Lowland Gardens, Bird Paradise and Middle Kingdom.
I like Hong Kong!
Sep. 29 Sunday Sunny
It made us very tired.
Because there are a lot of matters waiting for us, such as much homework, preparing lessons, doing exercises, and so on.
There are so many heavy duties that I can't relax.
So every Sunday, I go to relax.
Guess where I went these days.
Went shopping?
To see friends?
You're all wrong.
In fact, I went to have English lessons.
He is very friendly.
Some of his students show their English.
It's perfect!
So I make up my mind, I'll tried my best!
Oct.6 Sunday Sunny
Our family lived in Guangzhou for many years.
The parks were safe.
The people were friendly.
But Guangzhou changed.
Today the streets aren't clean.
The parks aren't safe.
The population is increasing.
They thought Guangzhou is a very good place to make money.
I think they are too disgusting to stay here.
Oct.12 Saturday Sunny
Strong Teachers
This sports meeting is especially wonderful.
Because the teachers also attended the sports meeting.
For example, our Chinese teacher Mr Zhu shot put, our English teacher Miss Lin shot put, too.
And our history teacher, maths teacher, chemistry teacher and physics teacher ran.
In the end, Mr Zhu won the champion.
You are the best!
Our lovely teachers!
Oct.19 Saturday Sunny I have ever heard something interesting about two presidents (I don't remember if this is their position) of England and the United States.
When they were talking, the American president wanted to go to toilet, so he said, "Excuse me, where's John?
" John meant toilet in America.
But the English president didn't know.
He answered,"John?
No one is called 'John' here."...
Oh, what an interesting thing!
ct.26 Saturday Sunny Half a month ago, Miss Lin and Mr Yang came.
After half a month, they left us.
On the day that they said good-bye to us, all of us were unhappy.
And we sent them two cards and presents.
They were moved.
Miss Lin gave us a letter with tears in her eyes.
Mr Yang wrote several sentences on the blackboard, " I go quietly, as I came quietly.
I waved my sleeve, and took away the rosy clouds.
" Don't be so sad, our teachers.
We'll meet again some day.
And we'll not forget you.
Nov.2 Saturday Sunny Easier said than done "Jack!
" Jack's mother called out in the kitchen.
"Don't watch TV any more.
You must go over for your tomorrow's test.
" "Don't worry, Mum.
English is very easy for me.
" But a few days later, the teacher announced that Jack had failed in the exam.
It is always easier to be said than to be done.
If you don't go over the lessons, you won't get a good grade.
Hard work leads to success.
You won't say "that's easy" before you do.
Remember, easier said than done!
But I like watching sports match.
Because I began to play table tennis and volleyball.
I found them very amusing.
I like playing badminton best.
It can keep me fit, make me happy.
I'm trying to like other sports.

That's why we are learning English in China.
It is one of the world's most important languages because it is so widely used.
So we must learn English hard.

So he gave another paper to them .
Dec.14 Saturday Sunny Don't waste time Some students often waste their time.
They spent too much of their time in playing games, watching TV and doing other things.
But they didn't understand they had done wrong.
And they said that they didn't have enough time to do their homework and prepare their lessons.
They didn't know how to make good use of their time at all.
Many people know that time is life.
And time is very precious.
We must take care of time and remember that time is more precious than money.
Because there is so much homework to do.
It's so tiresome.
Now, the Winter Holiday comes, and the homework comes together .We had thought to relax in the holiday.
Though I'll do it carefully.
I hope I can make progress in the next term.
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival comes.
It makes people so happy.
Because they can get much lucky-money.
So they always follow their parents to go here and there .
Because they feel shy.
Over 2000 years ago, there lived a farmer in the State of Song.
In his field stood the stump of a tree.
Suddenly the hare bumped against the stump, and died on the ground.
Then the farmer put down his plough, hurried to walk up to the stump and picked it up.
He was very happy.
He waited and waited.
It was raining this morning.
The street was wet and slippery.
Suddenly the granny fell down.
The little boy ran to help her and took her to the other side of the road with the woman.
Then when the granny felt well to thank them, the little boy's face turned red.
They helped the granny get on the bus and went away.
What a kind boy he is!
Today is sunny.

It's so unfair!
Books are very important to us.

Headache or others?
But to me, it's toothache.
I think toothache is so bad.
And the most trouble thing is that I couldn't eat more food.
My friends!

Some students would be sad when they got a bad result in the exam.
They usually scold themselves, "Why did I get such a result?
" "How foolish I am!"...
But in fact, can this improve their score?
The answer must be "No".
At this time, what they must do is to study harder.
"Everyday is a new day.
Be active in our studying, and you will be successful!

Because the mouse often runs after it.
We must get rid of it.
"Flea market" was a strange word for the Chinese people in the past.

But after one day an incident changed my mind.
It was a small test of English in class, and I hadn't gone over the lesson before.
I always thought that English was easy to study for me.
I have got an English-Chinese dictionary.
I have many presents.
But I like the dictionary best.
It has become my good friend as well as my teacher.

To this day, we have begun our lesson for two weeks.
Last week, we had a test of English and physics.
Everybody tried their best to go over .
The first was that I still didn't try my best to go over .
The other reason was that I cared less in my test.
From the test, there is a lesson for me that I must study hard.
Saturday    Mar.15   Cloudy
When I heard of this, I was so happy hat I nearly went to the bookshop at once.
So as a student, we are difficult aj1,6-7] to select and buy a good book.

When the classes were over, I went to the bookshop at once.
I was surprised when found the bookshop.
Sunday  Mar.30   Sunny
This week we'll have several subjects to test.
So in the morning, I was going over the lessons.
At the beginning of the study, I always felt so dull that I didn't go on with it.
When I stopped going over my lessons d started to read the newspaper, my other came in my room.

But now I must go over my lesson at home.
I know my duty is study now, and only can I do is study, too.
Sunday   Apl.
Having true friends isn't an easy thing, and no person can live alone.
Because there was no one to help him when he was in trouble.
He had a lot of friends, but none of them could understand him.
He had no true friends, so he had chosen the way to end his young life.
Through the story , we can learn a lesson: "A friend in need is a friend indeed!

A letter to my friend Li Li: How are you recently?
I haven't heard from you a long time I think it is too busy and nervous in our study for us to write to each other.

I am so worried that I can't do it well.
Though I have gone over them again ad again this week.
But the only thing I can do isn't the worry.
I still remember what my old teacher said, she said: we must thrust ourselves, nothing can change our mind if we decide to do it well.

My Future
I decide to become a middle school teacher.
I had this dream when I was still a child.
I don't think to get on with the children all the time is wasting time.
On the contrary, it would be happier to me.
We all know, the teachers are badly in need of in our country, but not so many of us want to be a teacher.
The main reason of this is the work of the teachers is too hard and can't get so much.

It was an interesting, instructive and famous story.
The story was: Once upon a time there lived an emperor who cared much for fine new clothes.
He changed different clothes each hour of the day.
One day two cheats who said that they could weave the most beautiful cloth in the world.
The cheats were given some gold , beautiful silk and the best thread.
They pretended to weave cloth very hard.
During the days, the emperor asked some officials to go into the hall and see the new clothes.
But they all could see nothing.
Finally, the new clothes was "finished".
In fact , he saw nothing.
How foolish the emperor was!
He "put" on the few clothes and walked down the road.
He knew he was cheated until the people beside the road cried he wore nothing, there wasn't a new clothes on him.
Dec 24th, 1995  Sunday   Sunny
I passed the matches after all.
Though I wrote the poems and songs and read aloud the English not very well.
I hoped I could gain the marks or my class.

I ought to try to do more things in order to get along with everything.
I also sent some cards to them.
Miss Lin: Happy New Year's Day!
Jan 1st , 1996  Monday    Sunny
It's the New Year's Day.
All the people are happy.
I couldn't help thinking of many things in the last year.
I thought of my old classmates, my dear teachers, my Alma Mater.
I was sure I could get along well with very thing .
It was the first time to see a singer with my own eyes.
Of course, I was very pleased last night.
My grandma has moved near my house recently.
Both her house and my house are the highest of the building , so it's not convenient to see her.
I have to see her once a week.
The teachers of geography, history and computer had begun to work on writing the outlines for us to go over.
I heard the final exam would be on on the last days of this month, and this time we would have eight subjects' exams together.
The physics teacher told us that she had no time to help us go over the lesson.
Physics is the hardest for e to study.
I was afraid I would not pass the physics exam.
The emperor still held his head high.
But the people by the street cried louder and louder.
More and more people agreed with the child.
The emperor became angry though he felt very silly.
The emperor said angrily "Yes, I was cheated by the cheats.
But why didn't you tell me early?
In fact, everyone laughed at the emperor by heart when they heard that, including the officials.
None of them said a word.
At last, the child shouted, at the emperor "You don't like an emperor!
You just like a fool!
Now, I order you, "Get out"!
When the emperor found him wrong, it was so late.
Ever since then, he had nothing to wear, nothing to eat and had no money, he was the only one in the empire.
By and by, he died.

You ought to see her.
Of course, you must go.
There were many people in my grandma's , who were my granduncles and grandaunts.
We had lunch around the table and sat side by side.
All of us were having a good time.
I thought the happiest thing was that I could get the last lucky money from them.
This was an ordinary day, but it had already brought me much pleasure.
I hoped every day could be like today.
Because there were many new teachers to try to give classes for us.
They all perhaps gave classes the first time, thus they seemed shy , and said not so well and clearly but we never mind .
One of them gave us physics.
She spoke wonderfully.
She wasn't like a new teacher at all, instead, she looked as if she had taught for a few years.

I thought we could win at last.
After some minutes, the boats returned.
One, two......None of them were ours.
To our surprise, the other three boats had reached the riverside, our oat hadn't gone through the bridge have yet.
A long time passed, our boat was driven towards the riverside.
Though we didn't win, we still felt glad and interesting.

He stared at the footprint, full of fear.

He dare not go out and look for food.
But no savages came.
He decided to go out again after a time.
But just then his old ill dog which was his only friend died.
Crusoe felt very lonely.
He found it wasn't his own.
Crusoe at once did some measures.
He built another fence round his cave, made holes in the wall and placed his guns in them, pointing outwards.
But he still continued to look for a better hiding-place.
He found one in the rock, which was more than twelve feet high and had a narrow entrance.
He came into the cave, when he suddenly saw two yes glaring at him out of the darkness, he ran away into the daylight quickly.
After a time, he held a lighted stick to step into the dark cave again.
It was the goat's eyes that he had seen.
The goat rolled over and died immediately.
Crusoe was satisfied with the high dry hiding-place.
He placed five guns and much gun-powder there, and made some candles to give light.
So he lived on the island for months and years.
Every day he climbed to a high rock to keep watch.
Crusoe was full of fear again.
As soon as the savages had gone.
Crusoe made his way down to the shore with two guns to have a look.
He went towards the fire, he found the bones of a human being among the ashes!
But ever since then, no one arrived at the island.

The Spring Festival is coming.
So in these days, each of the members of my family was busy.
First, mother and I went shopping on Sunday, we had bought some biscuits and sweets as the gifts.
And then we must clean the house.
This morning, I got up early.
Because I had much work to do.
When I began the diary.I had just finished a part of the work.
Though I was very busy in these days, I still had interest in it.
Feb 6th, 1997 Thursday Rainy
Today is the New Year's Eve.
It was rainy and cold.
I didn't want to go out, but this evening many people would come to my home to have dinner, I had to help my mother buy something.
I had thought that there must be few people in the street.
That seemed a warm air in the cold weather.
I could feel warm in my whole body.
I hoped it would be fine tomorrow after all.
This week in our class two young women came, who are they?
They will try to be a good teacher more than six weeks.
To my joy, I should get to know two friends.
This made us very surprise and happy.
I think two new teachers aren't much older than us.
This is the Mid-Autumn Day.
It is a remarkable day.
Why the moon was around has a fairy tales .
Some people are happy, but some people are unhappy.
I have no time to play.
It will be time to ... for own class .
Then, all the boys take an active part in this sport meeting.
I also want to take part in.
but I regret I couldn't take part in.
But he has the courage.
This is very good.
All the students ran very fast.
I will remember this sports meeting for ever.
You should be surprised for what's summer sleep.
I have ever read a book about the summer sleep.
Let me tell you.
Because the weather in summer is too hot for some animals to live.
They only sleep two or three weeks then they wake up to find food and water.
I have to go to school for six days in this term.
Then I stay at home for only one day.
How do I spend the Sunday?
Let me tell you.
In the morning I get up later than usual.
I don't get up until eight o'clock.
In the afternoon I sleep a long time.
I didn't like to go out to play.
We had a lesson of English on Friday afternoon.
It was a young man with glasses that spoke to us.
As a speaker he taught us how to study English very well.
What he said" I enjoy Losing Face," let me know English more than before.
I think the note Book of Lesson .
I think the Note Book of Lesson One " How Karl Marx learn English.
New ways are better than old ways.
We visited the Xi Zhao Hill last Saturday.
That day I had a good time.
I saw many things which I hadn't seen before.
There are a lot of fairy tales in differently .
If you visit our school, the No.
Now our school is changing.
I can't see the new school.
I will try my best to do with the work.
The school will be much beautiful before long.
He would take the papers to London himself.
The weather turns colder and colder.
Many people don't want to get up early in the morning.
They stay in bed and feel warmer than out of bed.
It says sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work with brains most of the day, and then sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy, they are also very useful for character-training.
China is a larger country, then there are many people.
Most of them all love football very much.
I like history best of all these.
I look on him as a good teacher.
Because you can't see the old school, which you have even seen.
Now our school is changing.
All the students try own's best to help.
The school will be much beautiful before long.
The winter holiday was short.
It was only two weeks.
I read them very carefully, and that I knew what the world is.
Every several days I will go out to play football and basketball with my good friends.
Now I can play long.
Doing good housework is not easy.
The Spring Holiday, which one year is one time, is 1997 this year .
In this year, there is a great thing that Hang Kang will be returned to our country.
I don't know how to do.
I care a little interest in it .
I don't like this animal.
I can do everything I like in it.
The place where we live is old, it isn't tall.
It well be rebuilt and built tall thing .
I don't we would move to where yet till now .
4 Middle school.
Such will make me very tired.
I want to cry.
I don't hope that I change the place.
Many people don't want to get up early in the morning.
It isn't a good thing.
A bad news came from Beijing in February 1997.
All the country is in sad feeling.
He loved all the people of China deeply.
All the people of China love him deeply too.
I am a student.
I decide to try my best to study.
Our country is getting stronger and stronger, the people are getting richer and richer.
We can't forget comrade Don Xi Ping.
He is living in our heart.
If you visit our school, the No.4 Middle school you must feel very surprised.
Because you can't see the old school, which you have even seen.
Now our school is changing.
All the students try their best to help.
The weather is quite bad in several weeks.
It rains all day and all night.
Looking at the sky, the sky is not blue, it is deeply dark.
The old man must be taken good care of.
It isn't a good thing.
Expect the weather to turn good.
Basketball is a wild interesting game whose game the people all the country especially the young man, love very much.
In fact, basketball is a good fun, it can make people strong, bring a good time to people.
They play well and often hold the match.
They sent a new teacher to us.
She is more a good friend than a good teacher.
There are more people than last year.
Something are burned, they give off poisonous gases.
The government's order is praised.
The people hope like this .
Our school held the match of the ten-singer.
This is a good idea.
At last, only one of them get in the last match.
Nobody could think he would win the match.
But to our surprise, he won.
They adviced us to write our own name into a piece of long cloth.
All the students take an active part in this.
Our country will become stronger and stronger.
I visited the Tong de Garden with my good friends last week.
It is wide and great.
I think the Tong De Garden is one of the beautiful places.
The people who live there must be very happy.
It is really a good place.
If someone asks you: " what is more important Chinese or English?
" I will answer it is Chinese that is more important than English.
Chinese is not only our native language, but also a base of learning the other subjects well.
Chinese and English both are difficult to study well, but we make progress more rapid in English than Chinese.
So some people would think English is important.
When we study English, we have to translate it into Chinese.
My new school.
We are united and friendly.
We love our school because it is big and wonderful, around the schoolrooms stand all kinds of trees.
Sports and games are becoming more and more popular in the world.
Because they are of great value.
They could build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy.
In our country, a plan is being carried out.
" This plan is welcome.
Sports and games are also useful for character training.
It is hard to say this because my English is very limited.

Books are our friends.
Almost all great men in the history of mankind loved books.
There is no genius without books.
But it isn't all the books are fit for us to read .
We should choose books that not only interest, ... the book for reading is always for fun.
Some books are to be read roughly, but some must be read slowly and carefully.
When we .. we don't understand questions, we should use the dictionary.
Because the dictionary is our best teachers.
Let books be our good friends all the time.

Time is more valuable than money.
People often say: " time is money.
" But in fact, time is more valuable than money.
But when the time is lost, it will return of ever .
So we shall understand time is very valuable.
The time is not only valuable but also limited.
Someone ever said: " Time is life; Time is money; time is ...".
Waste the time is waste the life.
We should get into the good habit of saving time.
Don't put off what can be done today until tomorrow.

If you that, I think you will learn English very, and find it easy.
MARX AND FORETGH SANGUAGES

When he got there he found that his English was not good enough, so he worked hard to improve it .
In one of his books, Marx had this to say about has to learning a foreign language.
Only when he can use the new language without thinking of his own language , we can say that he can learn a foreign language.

Since then the number of milu deer there has greatly increased.
GO TO MEXICO AND CLIMB POPO
Above all, it has the most beautiful mountains in the world.
Popo is one of them.
No one good climber with strong heats should try Popo.
Our way is straight up the mountain.
We climb very slowly.
Our hearts beat quickly.
More and more often we stop to rest.
We can see the top nearly two miles above, for it is full of the light of a million stars.
We sit in the snow to rest with a very bad headache.
Because the air is very thin .
We are seventeen thousand feet above the sea.
In the halls of the first four storeys there are many.
And why do we call it "the Yellow Crane Tower"?
A Taoist often came to drink here.
Each time he was allowed to drink without payment.
Once before leaving .
Mrs Xin got richer and richer.
It stood on the south bank of the Ching Jiang River in Wu Chandg.
In Nai ICE CREAM
But ice cream was known long before America was discovered.
He sent out hundreds of men to bring snow and ice from the mountains.
The Roman emperor Nero used to use the snow and ice to make cold drinks.
Traveler Maco Pdo brought back recipes for chilled and frozen milk from China.
Hundreds of years later, ice cream reached England.
It is said that King Charles I enjoyed that treat very much.
Americans alone eat more than two billion quarts a year.

Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he as going to give his invention to the government.
This invention of his will greatly benefit the whole world, so two government officials would come for the papers at eleven o'clock in the morning.
But two thieves shut the right men in an empty house and took away their cards.
As they looked too nervous and were too anxious to leave, the professor didn't trust them.
He only gave them some other papers, and they left in a hurry.
Shortly after that, two police officers came to his house.
They said that the two men were impostors, and they must try hard to catch them.
But he professor said it was not necessary.
Because he still kept he papers on his invention .

Though we didn't try our best to practise, we practised very seriously.
We didn't leave school, until it turned dark.
But the other classes, they spent every night to practise .
If they waste much time to practise.
It must affect their studying.
The end of term is coming, we shouldn't waste time to do the others things.

Because that will have effect in their studying .
Finally I wish we can enter the finals.

"
January 5.

Perhaps I didn't read enough.
Perhaps I didn't do my best to study English.
Though that, I will go over it carefully.
I must go over it carefully, too.
Only nine days !
The time isn't enough.
I didn't want to write so much.
I'd better go over now.
My winter holiday
The date was February 1.
It was Saturday, my first holiday in winter.
My father had to clean alone because my mother had to go to work that day.
Though I was very busy, I regretted I had never given him a hand.
Though that, I had never made him disappointed.
I became a cook and cooked some food to eat together.
He was very happy.
I promised if I had spare time.
I would do some housework.
This winter holiday seemed that we had some time to rest.
But in fact wasn't like that.
We had plenty of homework.
We must finish it quickly.
I will receive some money.
I will have spare time to rest.
Finally I wish everybody happy Spring Festival.
The Spring Festival
February 6 was the day before the Spring festival.
In the evening the supper was very plentiful.
I ate enough.
After supper my family went to the flower market.
There were a lot of flowers.
Plenty of people looked like a sea.
All kinds of flowers made the road very beautiful.
We could go for some food or buy something.
The date was February 7.It was the first day of the Spring Festival.
I congratulated my parents on everything as soon as I woke up.
My parents gave me two "red bags".
There was some money in the "red bags".
They wished me grow faster and study well.
At that time I could receive some "red bags".
I almost did the same work in several days.
I felt very light-hearted.
I shouldn't do nothing in several days.
Break Away The Habit February 1 was the first day of the winter holiday.
I almost finished my homework.
That day was Saturday.
But I knew I shouldn't waste time.
So I reduced to listen music and watch TV.
But I still watched TV in the evening because I had formed the habit.
Every evening I spent out four hours in doing homework.
I won't watch TV every day including the public holiday.
One day mother and I went to a restaurant for some food.
I looked around the restaurant after I sat down at a table.
The waiter asked him what he wanted.
The man opened his mouth, put his fingers in it and took them out gain.
The waiter soon brought him a cup of tea.
The man moved his head from side to side.
The waiter took away the tea.
In a moment hi brought a cup of coffee.
The man again moved his head from side to side.
At last the man put his hand on the stomach.
At that time I understood what's the mean.
He wanted some food.
In a few minutes there was a large plate of meat and vegetables in front of him.
After that I learned his signs.
I wanted mother to suppose what I wanted.
March 9.
It was our turn to be on duty last week.
Everywhere was very dirty.
Though hat, we were not afraid to clean them.
We were afraid to get up so early.
Every morning we must get to school before 7 o'clock.
Some of us didn't have breakfast until the second class was over.
Every day my team must clean the leaves.
I thought my team was the most careful in our class.
In that week all of us were very tired.
We could sleep enough.
March 15.
We handed in some books for some poor children and some people in the country.
It was the first time of the new term.
Perhaps it was the last time.
But it was very useful.
I thought the books were more useful than money, because we handed in all kinds of books.
This could make them recognize this world quickly.
Some ways could make the people who lived in country improve the agricultural production, and improve their living condition.
March 23.
Recently, I was surprised at two pieces of news.
The first piece of news was about the clone experiment.
When the person of world heard the news which the clone experiment has succeeded, everyone was very surprised at it.
Since the sheep was reproduced in British, everyone has been afraid of seeing a person will be reproduced.
Though a lot of people were against this experiment, some people were for it.
So I hope Miss Lin can give us a lot of chances to hear English in order that I can improve my hearing.
March 30.
But today it isn't more beautiful than before.
I think the factories and homes burned the coal was a major cause.
So we must begin to solve the air pollution problem of GuangZhou.
If we do not solve the water pollution problem in time, the fish will no longer live in the river.
I am eager o swim in it in the future.
April 6.

We were going to run around the street in the morning.
It kept on in the morning.
I thought we didn't need to run.
So I got to school at 7:30.
They were talking about if they must run in the rainy day.
At last a teacher told us to walk with raincoats.
We talked everything with each other in the street.
When we walked about five hundred metres, the teacher told us we needn't go on walking.
So we were very angry.
It made us waste a little time.
I wondered why we should be sent to run.
April 13.
I have two tortoises in my home.

I wouldn't have a lot of breakfast.

After breakfast we went shopping.
At noon, I had lunch in my grandmother's family.
But I think we will have some changes to play together in the future.
May 11.

Many motorcycles in city also will hinder conditions and communication tool for public use.
Beijing go faster than any other city this in China.
When you walk on the street in Beijing, you well felt very safe and peaceful.
As a great city in the national in the future, Guang zhou should begin to think about it.

The life of Karl Marx
Karl Marx was born on May.
5th, 1818 in Germany.
He moved to London in 1849.
He wrote many works, such as : The Civil War in France, On Capital and Communism Manifest, and so on.
Last week I was not lucky.
The results gave me a message that I hadn't put my heart into study and there's nothing had been worth pride.
I have even written some articles to attack somebody and some systems.
Miss hinted that my way to suggest is not correct and sensible.
I say sorry to anybody that my articles have striken.
I keep my suggestion.
I thank Miss, you make me know that some things are one of my business, so it is not necessary for me to speak at great length on some questions .
I'd better put my heart into my study.
Going into the state The "Five-subject Test" will come in half and two months.
Four of them have already been finished teaching and began reviewing four weeks ago.
I decided to be a diligent one.
They are narrow and tattered in the ordinary times, the sick conditions of them are double in the rainy days.
So it is difficult for us to pass.
Now it is the rainy season, in the streets, there is mud, sand and dirty water here and there.
And one street which I usually pass to go to school is been repaired.
There are some large holes and they block the traffic.
So I am forced to pass: the other street to come or go to school.
Why can such streets have been laid here for five years and no one step out and suggest?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Football and I
My father is a football game an.
Under the influence of my father, I was interested in football game, both playing and watching.
As time went on, my interest in football became more and more.
When I became one student of our class, I found that there were a lot of football game fans in it.
So we had the same topic of conversation: football.
The football movement in our class improves so quickly.
And a group of master of football grow up.
I don't play football so good, but I still take an active part in it.
Last week, two new basketball playgrounds were finished building.
This made me happy.
We haven't seen a perfect basketball playground for four years, we didn't have enough palace to play since we were in grade Two.
So it was worth having a celebration.
In the other hand, the whole school was in deep sorrow at the news of our headmaster's death, for the people had come to love him as an inspiring leader and a wise, warm-hearted man.
Mr. Wang is one of the greatest of all the leaders in our school.
We believe that the living must finish the work of Mr. Wang.
We remember him for ever.
The tests of experiment.
Last week, we had three tests of experiment of biology, physics and chemistry.
In the ordinary time, I don't think it important to do experiments, so I didn't put my heart into it.
So last week I was in a frantic rush to deal with three different and difficult experiments.
I was so worried about that I would fail in them.
In order to pass the xam I went to the lab to demonstrate the experiments before the text.
Thank goodness, though I was so skilled and there were some accidents through the exams, but I still could pass the text.
My new school
My school is a key school with history of seventy years.
y school is big and beautiful.
There are a lot of trees around the school building.
There are two teaching buildings, one experiment building and one large playground in the school, the students can have physical training in the playground.
Now, there are 36 classes in the school.
Altogether there are 1800 students and 200 teachers.
The style of study is so good that students study hard.
And the teachers are excellent and strict with students.

Dear May: Thanks you for your letter.
First examine soil and ask your neighbours which plants grow best.
Sow seeds at the correct time of the year.
Don't grow plants in the same time year after year.
If you remove weeds before planting plants, the plants will grow taller.
Turn the soil over with a fork then sow seeds in the soil.
Then the plants will grow well.
Please write me soon.
Yours Li Baoling

It is five weeks since we went to school.
The sports meet will begin next week.
I have never attended the meeting during these years.
Because I am too bad in sports, I am afraid to lose it.
But this year, there are only eleven girls in our class.
I have to attend the meeting.
Though it is difficult for me to do that, and I have no confidence for it, I can try my best to do it well.
Every day I insist on running.
No.

The sports meeting
Today is Oct. 11,1996.
The day is the sports meeting of our school.
The weather is very good.
At about two o'clock, the sports meeting began.
But at that time, I am very afraid.
Because I will attend the running of the 400 metres .
This is a trial.... later I have finished the running.
Though I am the last one .
I am very pleased with this match.
I try my best to do it.
Sitting at the desk, I turn on my computer.
Then, I enter the windows and play the games---chess.
My father likes it very much.
Because it an play with my father and it is more than the chess.
I like it, too.
This disk is an encyclopaedia.
It is a good "book".
Computer is a good entertainment and tool.
Many people study it now.
I think that I must try my best and do it better.
Who are they?
They taught us Chinese.
During this period, they tried their best to teach us well, they are very conscientious, and they are our teachers, they are also our friends.
They often talk with us after class and often help us to do everything in class.
How to learn English.
This Saturday afternoon some people who are from the Hot Youth Corporation came to our school.
They taught us how to learn English.
We are all interested in it.
For Chinese people, spoken English is the most difficult, but is is also important.
I think it is right.
I don't like to speak English from time to time.
Now I begin to know that is wrong.
I think I can do it well.
Have a trip.
Today is Nov.23.
We go to HSCHIAD HILL.
We are all happy and excited.
First, we came to the Tian Lake.
For example : the monument, the CUI ROCK, the Bai Yun Grotto.....
At three in the afternoon, we left the HSICHIAO HILL for Guangzhou.
Play a play.
On Friday, I take part in English extracurricular activities.
We began to play a new play.
I am in the Group 2, and I would act the "ice".
At last, they all understood: "we all have our place, we all have our say.
If we face the strong point and the shortcoming correctly .
We are the strongest people in the world.
The professor and his invention
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the government.
Because Professor Hunter was not strong enough to go o London, her daughter didn't let him go to London himself.
They were Dr. Brown and Mr. Rose.
They were impostors.
They seemed to be nervous and were to anxious to get the papers, so professor didn't trust them.
He gave them some other papers.
But professor asked them not to worry bout his invention.
The papers which two men had taken were not the real ones.
I love Beijing.
In 1993, my parents and I went to Beijing.
When I got to Beijing, I love this city at once.
Beijing is the capital of China.
Great changes have taken place since 1978.
Many buildings and houses have been put up.
In 1992, we held the Asian Games in Beijing.
Beijing is also a beautiful city.
There are many famous wonders and spots, such as the Great Wall, the Beihai Park, the Summer Palace, and so on.
They are very beautiful.
I love Beijing and I hope that she will be made better and better.
My Future.
Many people didn't want to do a teacher.
Because they thought it is hard to do .
I think it is true.
But I am not afraid.
At that time, a blind man with a stick came towards them.
Being blind, he touched one of the young men on the foot.
The young man stood up with anger and shouted at the blind man.
Just then, a young girl came up.
She glared at the young man and took the blind man by the arm and led him across the street.
This time, they all felt sorry.
Dear Jack, We appointed to go to the park together that Sunday morning last week, didn't we?

Sunflowers
Have you ever seen sunflowers?

They are growing here and there, before or behind houses, along roads or around the fields.
A sunflower looks like a tree.
But it's a kind of grass.
It comes up in Spring and has seeds in autumn.

He was very terrified.
He stayed in his cave, he was afraid to go out, even for food.
And because he often thought about the footmark, he decided to go back to have a look.
When he went back there, he tried his feet again, but it was so large.
Crusoe concluded that the island had many savages.
He looked for a better hiding place, but in that he saw two eyes, he stepped back into the cave.
In the Autumn, Robinson saw nine savages, he found the bones of a human being after the savages has gone.

The river water was very clean.
I love these places and this trip was very happy!

Summer Job Hunting.
The term is drawing to an end.
We'll have a holiday of nearly two months.
Many of us are making a plan for it.
As usual, I'll make a plan, too.
But this plan will be different from those I made before.
I think it is time for me to know more about society.
So I have decided to find a summer job during the holiday.
In this way I can not only apply what I have learnt in class to practice but also earn some money to help support my family.
This holiday I have two trips, and a long time to go to school.
So I think this plan didn't realize.
But this plan will be realized in next holiday.

And they were polite.
For example, Ocean Park,Wong Da Xian .

Hong Kong is the best city I love.
I thought if I was that beautiful girl or the little boy.
I didn't do that.
When the nobleman died, I am to burn their house and farm.
But nothing else, the two noblemen were dreadful.
I showed sympathy for the boy and his sister.
The National Day

This report's speaker is Mr Chen.
He is one of the Li Yang's students.
He talks English well and fast.
He talked to how to speak English louder and speak it like an Englishman.
It was very possible for us to study English.
I hoped I would have a good result in the Middle Exam.
The sport which I like best.
Sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting fat, and keep us healthy, and give us valuable practice in helping the eyes, brain, and muscles to work together.
So we like the sports very much.
The sport which I like is dancing, playing basket-ball.
Because playing basketball can let me taller and taller, and I like watching a close game of basketball .
I am very interested in it.
So, I like them very much.
But I didn't always take part in them.
We will have the Article Day on Dec. 25 1996.
One is singing, and one is boys' singing, one is Beryl's playing the piano, the other is dancing.
But the girls didn't want to do.

Greatest Changes
This Monday, when we got to our school classroom.
There are many white boards.
Instead of the old blackboard .
They don't breathe he ash of chalk.
This will help their health.
But this is the new thing.
I like my school
My school, Guang zhou the No.4 Middle School, lies in the west of Guang zhou City with a history of seventy years.
e have thirty classes of six different grades.
There are over wo hundred teachers and over two thousand students in my school.
Change
Our family lived in Guang zhou for many years.
And for many years, Guang zhou was a good place to live.
The streets were clean.
The parks were safe.
The people were friendly.
But Guang Zhou changed.
Today the streets aren't clean.
The parks aren't safe.
The population is increasing.
he reason which made his change is the other provinces people.
So lots of them came to Guang zhou to work.
Because not all of them can be invited, so some people go to steal or rob.
This made Guang zhou not safe.
I think they are too disgusting to stay here.
The Importance.
From the newspaper, I knew that the NMET will be have listening text in next year.
So we must pay attention to training our listening.
I think it is useful for me to improve the listening.
I think you will give me some advice, will you?
Thank you!
Miss White: Good morning!
I couldn't go to school today.
ecause I am not felling well tomorrow morning .
After got up , I ad a headache and had a little fever.
So I asked or one day's leave.

My New School
My school is a key school.
It is seventy years old.
My school has 36 classes now.
And there are 200 teachers in it.
y school is very big and beautiful.
Some trees stand around the chool building.
It has two school buildings and one lab and a big playground.
They have rich experiences, we all show respect to them.
It stands beside the low green hills.
It has more than 90 families.
There is about 500 people.
Great changes have taken place in my hometown these years.
An food processing factory has been set up in the west of it.
Some peasants buy the motorbikes.
They are becoming richer and richer.
So I love my home town very much.
June 14th.
Sunday  sunny.
This afternoon is very hot.
I think this time is good for swimming.
I see some children swimming in a river.
Some of them are good players.
In the middle of the river, a little girl is learning swimming.
Her mother teaches her how to swim.
The last swimming was in Beijing in spending my holiday ten years ago.
I think June is the best month in one year.
I like June very much!
There is going to a lecture on June 4th.
That day is Wednesday, and the lecture will begin at two o'clock.
The lecture will be held on the big playground.
The lecture is given by Professor Wilson.
He is an English teacher of Hang zhou University.
he will speak on the difference between the British English and American English.
Please come on time.
And when the lecture over , you can come back your class and have a discussion.
That's all.
Thank you.
The world is strange and unfair.
Women can be elected beauty, but men havn't.
Every woman wishes to be beautiful.
I get it!
I get it!
" From then n, her life will be changed.
Because she has "changed" into a beauty .
And because of these, they couldn't "change" their lives.
Aha!
Sex!
We are very lucky.
Because we have completed body .
Somebody will think it usual: every one has a completed body, nothing strange.
But the deformity hope to have completed body very much.
They have each drawback.
They would be lame, blind, deaf or dumb.
On ordinary days, they have more difficulty than any other person when they do things.
They would be treated unfair without any season .
They are innocent.
No body wants to be a deforming person.
We should help each other, especially to the deformity.
When they are in trouble, they want that anybody would help him.
If we help them at that time, they could feel warm in their hearts.
But after they become rich, they don't know how to act as a boss.
Here, let me teach them.
So they can lead different woman back home very night.
Second, he must call for a taxi or buy a car when he goes out.
It is very "cheap" to ride a bus.
Third, because of a boss, you must speak some English words in your talking.
Last, you must make some cards with your name.
when you see everyone, like beggar, neighbour, pedlar (D?).
So everyone will know you are a boss.
After this, you are really a boss.
Rain
The rain will never stop.
Raining, raining, raining, from morning to evening, from evening to morning, it still rains hard.
I don't know where the water comes from.
The ground always is wet.
If a little piece of ground is going to be dry, a heavy rain will make it wet again.
The shopkeeper is very happy for these.
Ah!
Raining, Raining, Raining again!
There are some women.
But when men see them, men will turn soft like a sheep.
All the men's money must be handed to he women every month.
If the men want to use a fen, first he must make a report.
With the women's permitting, then hey can receive he money from the money and use it.
People name the women " tiger wife".
Look!
There are thirty-six classes, 1800 students and more than 200 teachers.
Our school is large and beautiful with trees around it.
Our teachers are excellent.
They are strict with students and the students respect their teachers.
I like this school.
Pencil-box.
I wanted to buy a pencil-box.
My God!
" most of the designs of the pencil-boxes were for girls.
A girl with long hair was playing with rabbit; Bon Bon Cat and so on .
Oh!
Who is Bon Bon Cat?
A cat can throw bombs and make a very loud noise "Bow"!
or a cat can eat bomb hen the bomb explodes in its belly (??).
Fortunately, I didn't buy the "Bon Bon Cat".
I bought a pencil-box------ "Con Con Monkey"!
June 14, 1997.
Saturday sunny
It is hot today.
In this afternoon, the temperature is nearly thirty centigrade.
There are about seven or eight children are swimming.
Many of them are ood t swimming.
A little girl is learning swimming, and her mother teaching her.
My last swimming was about ten years ago when I was spending holiday in Beijing.
Time.
A week is over again in the nervous exams.
he final exam is coming nearer and nearer.
But I feel that I ill have many things to do.
Perhaps I am lazy.
I like thinking, illusion.
So, I have done less work.
The final exam is coming!
Work hard!
In fact it is as pressing as regular classes.
So our new term began.
And we became busy by then.
Only after few days, the homework that the teachers gave us became more and more.
The most serious one is Chinese.
We must finish almost twenty pages of an exercise book which was just handed out two days before.
In the second week, we had three exams.
Going bankrupt
It also said that there was almost 100 yuan overspent.
It takes 80 yuan.
This must be settled by the ones on duty by keeping the cloth dry.
Close the door
The smoke and the smell went upstairs and came into the classroom through the backdoor.
We were sitting near the back door.
So we closed the door to keep it out.
Soon after that, our head teacher, Miss Lin, came and asked us to open the door.
We told her about the bad smell.
But she insisted that we must open the door.
Then there came gust.
As soon as we were going to close the door, Miss Lin came and prevented us again.
And we were scolded for it.
Running
When I got to school, I saw many students of the No.11 middle school running along the road.
In the school, I was told that we had to run, even in rain.
Chess
But soon we found another game to play.
It was the Flying Chess.
Questions and answers
The year 1997 has come.
On July 1, Hong Kong will be returned.
It's great day for China, so we held a questions and answers match bout Hong Kong to celebrate .
The match was divided into two parts.
at the beginning, the match was fair, but as time went on, some classmates began to shout and prevent the other groups from answering question.
Because of the fourth group's cheating, they won at last .
Since it is just a game, why not play fairly and happily?
Too much homework April was going to end, and the examination of graduation was coming.
All the things were carried on in a hurry.
Besides the curriculum's quickly going on, the homework was so much that it became terror.
To finish all the homework and paper, we were made to be of great urgency.
Every day there was full of work around us.
How terrible it was!
In the chemistry lab.
Because there were too many students, the classrooms were not enough.
It was trouble to get boiled water.
The lab was very far away from the mansion, so every morning we went to get boiled water group by group.
When the class was over, many students would rush out and play basketball, football .... Nearly half of the play ground was occupied by us.
But there were so many students in the lab hat it became confusion.
We had to see it on Friday afternoon.
Imminent as now, the teachers never let us be free.
They gave even more homework and exams.
How can we review well?
My new school
Many students graduated from our school had been famous.
Altogether, there are about one thousand and eight hundred students and more than two hundred teachers and workers.
Our school is large and beautiful.
Many green trees are planted around the school building.
The students can have sports on the lay ground.
The teachers in our school are excellent.
They are very strict with the students.
and the student respect them.
Many classmates play basketball after school, at noon and in the evening.
Our head teacher, Miss Lin, forbids them to do that and stops them by all the ways.
On Tuesday night, six students of our class played basketball after the self-study at night.
When Miss Lin passed by and noticed it, the students dissipated at once.
But at last they were captured eventually.
Playing basketball is a good deed, but playing late into the night is too excessive.
June 14, 1997.
Sunny.
Walking near the river, I saw some children swimming in it.
The weather was so hot that every body wanted to have a swim.
I used to swim in my childhood.
About ten years ago, I had the last time of swimming while I was spending my holiday in Beijing.
The fourth week.
I have had English classes for four weeks.
Before this week, I was very afraid of you when you asked somebody to answer your questions.
Then I thought: ther people will laugh at me when I give a wrong answer.
In this week, I found my classmates didn't laugh at me after you asked me.
So I decide; I must study hard.
The fifth week.
Because National Day is coming, there are four days for rest.
What will to do in these days?
Except shopping, playing, watch TV, go over the homework .
One day my father talked with me about this matter.
Then I do so.
When I came into the stadium the first .
There liked a beautiful picture.
How good was the feeling!
The six Week
I cried for it over a night.
Though he didn't come into my home so long, my family got on well with him.
We have been good friends.
I had had two tortoises before "my friend" died.
But perhaps they have made friends with Karl Marx.
So I tried my best to treasure him.
I lost a good friend.
He leaves me for ever.
I couldn't excuse me.
The Seventh Week.
In the past few days, the people of Guang zhou were interested in a thing.
All the people of Guang zhou did some cleaning for it.
There were just two days for rest, my family began to do some cleaning.
I like health, but I don't like to clean.
I believe it is a hard work.
Then I did with them.My job was cleaning the windows.
" " OK.
" I anwered.
Then we began to take the match.
I tried to make the windows cleaning in a few times.
At last, the winner was Mum, but I was praised by them.Because the window of I cleaning were very bright .After that, I didn't hate do some cleaning any more.
I think it is an interesting work.
The Eighth Week.
When the sports meeting began, we had the ceremony of entering.
Because our monitor Xuan Yunsheng sticked some orange paper on the card .
The match began.
We put our heart into it.
In no time, our classmate Lu Ming hua took the champion in the one hundred metres of girls.
The Ninth Week.
Miss Lin handed out the English test paper yesterday.
I got 71 marks.
Though I passed this test, I believed 71 marks was very bad.
This test was for Unit 2.
It only has two lessons' knowledge.
How a few contents !
But I only got 71 marks.
The examination will come soon.
It is slow to do things.
I often do things slowly than others .
Example: doing homework, doing housework, even clearing up my school-bad ...
This test paper was done so bad, the important reason was this.
I must study hard.
No pains, no gains.
The Tenth Week.
My house has a " garden in the air".
There are many flowers in it.
I like them very much.
When you go into it in early morning, you will feel the air is very fresh.
In the sun, it looks like some crystals.
That is very beautiful.
In the autumn wind, leaves shake slightly.
Example : How to plant flowers?
How to manage them?
When do they bloom?
Why people say " last briefly" ?...
And it tells me the important thing is not to pluck flowers and take good care of them.
The Twelfth Week.
In this week, I became a farmer from a student.
I was happy and worried before we set out.
Happy, because we have just taken the exam, now we can loose .
I worked with the classmates, we sang together, smiled together, all the unhappy thinks were forgeten.
I think I can't forget it in my life.
The Thirteenth Week.
It was the first time since we came to this class.
So we were so glad.
Because this meeting was a democratic work-style .
Because our eyes were clear .
If you do the work very good and really put the heart into how to help classmates .
We can see.
Everyone can prove oneself and find one's shortcoming at the same time.The result was shown.
It proved our ideas was very right.
My good friend Xuan Yunsheng had the most ballots.
I must learn from her.
The Fourteenth Week.
We went to Pei lei cinema and saw the film on Saturday this week.
But my idea was wrong completely.
Though Japanese likes strongly,Chinese are never afraid of them.
As a Chinese, I must remember July 7th , 1937, must remember the Chinese history.
The Fifteenth Week.
I took part in the team of geography in the seventh and eighth lessons on Friday this week.
It was very interesting.
I wasn't interested in geography all along.
So such were the facts, I believed I can't change it.
But since I took part in the team of geography, I came to be interested in geography.
It told me a lot of knowledge about the earth and something in the earth.
Some think looks like very strange ago, but now it made me understand the fact and the truth.
The Eighteenth Week.
The foolish emperor believed them easily and gave them some gold to let them weave the cloth for him.
The two cheats set up two looms and pretended to work day and night.
After some time, the emperor sent his old Prime Minister to see how the cheats were getting along with his cloth.The old Prime Minister went to see and could not see anything.
But he didn't want to let anyone know he was unfit for his office.
Then he told the emperor the cloth was very wonderful.
Before long the emperor sent another official to see the cloth again.
The emperor was very pleased when he heard the official's words.
So he decided to have new clothes make of the splendid cloth for the procession.
The procession began.
" His words was whispered from one to the other.
At last, the braver people cried they couldn't see anything at all on the emperor.
The Nineteenth Week.
In this week, all the items of our chool's art programme have passed the first try.
My class there were a lot of programmes have entered the last match.
And some programmes of our class have won the prize.
And we won the third place on the programme of the handicrafts.
Through our school's art programme, we can see everyone loves our class, and school very much.
They aren't only speaking but also doing.
They took an active part in this art programme.
The important thing was they could try their best for class.
Such is our class, it is making progress.
The Nineteenth Week We took part in our school's art programme in the Peilei theatre today.
We shared in the pleasure of it.
In order that our class could make a good atmosphere .They went on doing this work until 10 clock last night.
This was the most support for her, and she must be encouraged greatly.
I deeply wish our school's art programme will be made better and better, because it has many people's support.
The Twentieth Week
My mother is a common woman, she has the Chinese women's nature: kind, good nature, honest, hard working and thrifty.
It sure that is not a shortcoming but I believe it is a big shortcoming.
Because I often do things slowly .
Then my ear is worse .
God save me!
" I think aloud and get up at once.
When I look at the watch, it shows 6:40.
OH!
My mum!
It's so late.
Do you dress ok?
I'll be all right.
" Two minutes passed, she says again: " The breakfast will be cold.
Quickly!
" ...
This is my mum.
So I love her, she is a very good mother for me.
Though many years have passed, I still remember the story.
So he gave his place to the little boy and the boy became a good emperor.
This was my beautiful hope for this story in my childhood.
Now I became a student.
I see and study the ings more than before.
At last he didn't care and fell down.
But I still believe the emperor was wrong.
The New Term
The First Week.
On Saturday, I went to my grandmother's home after the school was over.
She is only two.
I like her very much.
And I often played games with my good friends.
In this evening, I could leave my home to play the game of "1/2??2?
What is near me is not the toys, but the books and the school bag .
My parents work hard for me, they give me many things, including my happy childhood, without them I have nothing.
The Second Week
We have got to know for seven years.
She has a pair of big eyes, and a big and high nose.
She isn't very beautiful, but is very little.
I often smile and say to her: " Brother, (We call each other: Brother) your face is young for ever, it doesn't grow old.
") and ... and helping others.
She is a good monitor in our class, and she is a good friend to me.
The result of electing is Li Denghui of the Nation Party winning.
He wants to prove that he gets wide support through this electing, then he can make China has no way for him and he will be free to keep TaiWan as a country.
But he is wrong.
China won't change the Chinese people's hope.
If we are right, we don't change our idea forever.
Tai Wang is China's territory, Li Denghui doesn't obey this fact, even begs America and Japan to help him.
What a cheap man!
I became to like to kick the huttlecock recently.
f I was free, I would rather watch TV, Because I usually have a little spare time to watch TV .
So I buy a shuttlecock and kick with the girls.
They told my that they liked to kick shuttlecock as me before.
It can make us happy and light, and it is helpful for our riendship.I like it very much.
The Sixth Week.
The League members in our grade will go to?1 omorrow.
I want to make a paper flower this night, it is for expressing the words of my heart.
11.
1927.
Now the??
?
?is very wide and beautiful.
But it is the place where struggled sharply sixty-nine years ago.
There were many soldiers lost their lives at there.
The earth was dyed red by the soldiers blood.
Without them we have nothing.
So we can't take the good conditions for granted.
The paper flower is finished, I will put it in front of the "?
?1" and wish the soldiers who were buried were silent to " sleep" forever.
The Seventh Week.
The Footprint One day, Robinson Crusoe walked along the sands towards his boat.
On the way, he saw the mark of a man's foot.
'Is it a savage?
' Crusoe thought.
He was terrified by the footmark.
And so he hurried home---the cave.
He stayed in his cave for some days, but no savages came, and he became to feel more lonely without friends, because his dog was dead.
So he decided to go back and look if the footmark was made by himself.
But the foot print wasn't his.
So there must be somebody else on the island.
Then he decided to look for a cave where he could hide if savages came.
When he found a good place and stepped into it, suddenly he saw two eyes glaring at him.
Now he stepped back into the cave and found it was an old sick goat.
One morning, Crusoe found nine savages on the shore, they sat round a fire and ate something.
After they went by two canoes, Crusoe found the bones which the savages ate were a man's.
The Tenth Week
My house has a " garden in the air".
There are any flowers in it.
I like them very much.
In the sun, it looks like some crystals.
In the wind, leaves shake slightly.
And looks like to say "Good morning" to you.
The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me much knowledge about plants.
Example: How to plant flowers?
How to manage them?
When do they bloom ... And it tells me the important thing is not to pluck flowers and take good care of them.
The Fourteenth Week
THE STORY OF WELLIAM TELL.
Many years ago, Switzerland was ruled by Austria.
The hunter William Tell was same the other Swiss, not taking his fate lying down.
One day, William Tell came to Altorf with his son.
He saw that a pole was placed in the marketplace.
He knew what had happened: The governor who was sent by the emperor of Austria, placed his hat on the pole and ordered the Altorfers to bow before it.
Gessler thought out a cruel plan in order to punish them.
How brave!
And his son was brave, too.
My First Teacher.
My first teacher, who taught me in the Primary school .
We called her Miss Le.
Though she was the "first", I almost forgot her.
Because she didn't teach me so long and she was a very common teacher .
I only remember a little thing about her: She was thirty-five years at that time.
But I still remember a small thing about us clearly; one day, Miss Le checked our homework.
I didn't finish for playing.
At that time, I was in Grade One, still a little child.
But Miss Le didn't think about this.
I cried, but I must obey her.
After I did the homework for ten times, she let me go home.
Because it made me know: I wasn't a little child, I was a pupil, I must study hard .
I can't forget this thing, so I didn't forget my first teacher completely.
One Morning
In The Summer Holiday.
One morning in the summer holiday, I woke up early.
My bedroom became bright.
The balcony was covered by the sunlight.
The morning sunlight made me feel comfortable.
I thought that many little birds in it.
Their voice was not so good, but this was happy for me.
So cool !
Perhaps only in the morning, summer doesn't make us feel hot.
Many people went to work in a hurry.
Morning is a new beginning.
Though I am in summer holiday, shouldn't I miss a new start?
OH!
My Grandpa.
But his health is good.
because he gets up and does morning exercises at five o'clock every morning .Though he is old, his mind is still clear.
He likes reading.
Sometimes he tells me his past to teach me the truth of living.
But he seldom asks me the mark of the exam.
" So he not only gives me some advice about how to treat (?
?y) the studying correctly, but also collects some articles about the ways of studying to me.In fact,my grandpa is only a common old man.
But he is my mum's daddy and he is kind to me.
So in my heart, he isn't a common man.
Ideal
Ideal, perhaps everyone has one.
Because it is important for everyone .
When I saw the PLA man, I thought that he was so honour for defending our country, so I wanted to be.....
I seldom thought about the deal after I became a student.
But what I see and think is more than before.
Our society isn't perfect like my hope.
One day, I uddenly thought I must be a judge or a reporter.
As a reporter, she can report "the illness" of the society.
Perhaps this is my ideal.
But I really want to realize it.
But it must be helpful for our society and people.
My ideal isn't great, but I still try to realize it.
THE NEW TERM THE THREETH WEEK
Today is my grandpa and grandma's birthday.
I haven't seen them for some time because of the busy studying.
Today, when I wanted to explain that I was very busy, they said to me: "Dan dan, to our joy the best, not you come to see us constantly, but you study hard and get a good school report.
" " I must do what you said.
Thank you very much, my grandpa and grandma.
THE FOURTH WEEK
Because National Day is coming, I have a holiday for four days.
What will I do in these days?
Look, a group of old women are dancing, fans in hand.
How young they are!
Look, on the grass there are some children of not more than ten , they are playing a plastics football.
How little they are!
Perhaps we haven't played it for a long time, so we played it badly at first.
An hour passed.
Tired as we were, we didn't ant to stop.
Why?
Perhaps because of the good weather, the green trees, the kind old women, the little children and the good holiday.
What a beautiful morning it was!
THE FIFTH WEEK
There are lots of things which made me move in my living.
For example, my parents encourage me when I feel sad, my friends help me when I am in trouble, and so on.
At that time, my good friend, a nice girl supported me and took me to a hospital.
She didn't leave until the doctor finished seeing me.
It was eight in the evening.
When I wanted to cry, my friend said to me: " Insist on!
insist on !
let's go home.
I was encouraged and I gathered the strength to walk...
Though it was a small thing or a short word, I must thank it for giving me strength.
THE SIXTH WEEK
Our school takes the sports meeting every year, have had it for several years .
But every time there was something that made me moving.
This was a good chance.
We could see: In the class of P.E.
Oh!
They tried their best for our class's success.
THE SEVENTH WEEK
At that time, in West people's eyes, China was a bad race.
) because of this.
One day, Ji Hong chang went to a post office with his friend.
I don't know China.
Where is it?
You should say you were a Japanese, then you can get the foreigner's respect.
" Hearing these words, Ji Hong chang turned red with anger at once.
I will not be a slave of foreigner forever!
" Soon he went home and took a piece of wood, and wrote some things on it: I am a Chinese.
Then he put it in front of his chest, and went to the street holding his head high.
THE EIGHTH WEEK
Today is Friday.
It is the same as usual days: We must go to school.
But our new teachers will leave us today.
Though they stayed with us only three weeks, they have made friends with us.
They are Chinese teachers.
But they taught not only Chinese but also the truth about living to us.
They are good teachers.
The lessons which they taught were interesting and we were interested especially.
After the class, they played with us.
We regarded them as our friends.
Today they will leave us.
I can't write my words to express my idea.
THE NENETH WEEK
"Hello, It's Huang Xiao dan.
Who is that?
" "Hello, It's Xuan Yun shen.
" "What's the matter?
" I asked.
"Oh, no matter.
I only want to talk with you.
Are you free now?
" Xuan Yun sheng said.
" I'm doing homework now.
But since you want to talk with me, then I give some face to you .
" I answered.
"That's great.
I went shopping with my mum last night.
Can you guess what have happened?
" she asked.
"A thief stole the eople's wallet?
" I guessed.
"Oh, no.
" She said.
"Oh, ..." I wondered : Weren't the two men fools?
In Guang Zhou, which is a beautiful and modern city, there are some people such as these, they really made us disappointed very much.
THE ELEVENTH WEEK.
But it is swimming and table tennis that I like the best.
In summer, when I jump into a pool, I feel very cool and happy.
Swimming not only makes us happy but also does good to our bodies.
Can't I like it?
Table tennis match is very exciting.
When I watch a table tennis match, I feel proud.
Because the Chinese sports often win the match .
I like Wang Tao and Deng Ya ping very much.
THE TWELFTH WEEK.
The teacher of biology told us: If we felt bad, we should do the other things, in order that we could forget the unhappy things.
Because I often do so .
When I am unhappy, I will choose sleeping first.
Because I needn't think of anything in sleeping .
After sleeping , though I can't forget all things, my feeling becomes quietly, my train of thought become clear.
At that time I can know what has happened and what I should do.
Eating is a way as useful as sleeping.
But it does a little harm to my health, so I rather choose sleeping.
When I eat, I feel that I can do what I want to do.
How joyful it is!
At this time, I can forget the unhappy things.
THE THIRTEENTH WEEK.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
So after they got the invention, they didn't think whither the invention was right or wrong.
The invention which he gave them was the others papers.
Because he recognized that they were not the right men from government .
So when the other people were worrying about the invention, the professor was relaxing.
Because his invention was still on his desk!
THE FOURTEENTH WEEK
I got ill this week.
The illness and the medicine made me sad.
And I always wanted to sleep and had no energy in studying.
Sometimes I really wanted to put my heart into the exercises very much, but I couldn't.
At this time, I wish that I had had a good health.
And only when I was ill, did I know the health was important and sports was of great value.
But I often forget this.
n spare time, I'd rather watch TV, listen to the songs, read books or go to sleep.
he exam of this term will come soon, I must take care of myself to build a good body and full confidence.
My Winter Holiday
The winter holiday, I always imagined it was relaxing and wonderful.
But when the winter holiday came really, I found my idea was impossible.
Because my winter holiday was too short, it only had 11 days.
And I had a lot of things that must be done.
Such as: doing housework, doing home work, going over the text...Though these things weren't so wonderful, they brought me a valuable winter holiday.
Though it was a small thing, I could help my mum.
when I finished my homework, I felt satisfied.
Because I didn't lose the time in watching TV all day .Oh, I almost forgot a thing.That was, I has planned to finish reading three world famous works.
Now I has finished two.
I decided to read the last one.
But in fact, I couldn't understand them so well.
An Interesting Story
In order to impress her, the young man invited his girl friend to go to a world-famous restaurant one evening.
They had a very good supper, and they danced until midnight.
How wonderful this evening was!
They enjoyed themselves very much.
But at last, the waiter brought the bill to the young man.
The waiter saw this, he thought the young man might faint, so he quickly brought a glass of ice-cold water and emptied over the young man's head .
Then he took the bill back and added to : ' Ice water: 50P' though it is an interesting story, it is instructive to me.
I have learned the texts"The Lost Necklace" and "The Emperor's New Clothes".
These tests have the same meaning as this interesting story.
That is : we shouldn't care much for honor and money.
If we do, the bad result will belong to us.
We must be honest.
The Spring Festival.
I like the Spring Festival very much.
But the reason why I like it is not the same as before.
But it didn't matter.
I would forget this question soon.
Because there were so many things which made me happy .
For example: the beautiful new clothes, lots of suger, the flowers in all kinds of colors, the?
?, the interesting game with my little friends...
In my eyes, all the things were perfect.
How I wished the time could stop at that moment!
I still like the Spring Festival.
Because I can visit my relatives and talk with them .
I like the feeling when I stay with them.
How warm the feeling is!
We are often busy and have no time to visit each other .
So we are this special day very much.
To Chinese, reunion is an important thing.
My Father
In my childhood, I was afraid of my father.
Because I seldom saw him smile .
Through our talking, I know him a lot and I was afraid of him no longer.
His joke is not so interesting,but he still smiles louder than us.
When he was young, his poems were often published.But as his daughter, I don't like this at all.
Why?
Like many fathers, my father can repair lots of things,for example: light, washing-machine, radio, bicycle...
This is my father, he is only a common man.
On Duty.
But this time had some thing different from the last time.
Why?
Because our school is being built now .
So there are a lot of holes in the ground.
And there are many leaves falling into them.
Cleaning the ground was our duty.
So we must pick up these yellow leaves.
But all of us never mind.
Though the yellow leaves were wet and dirty we tried o pick up every one.
In our heart, we believe our chool is very beautiful.
Though there are a lot of bricks and earth on the ground.
It is still beautiful.
Because a modern high building will stand here soon .
The Air Garden
There is an air garden on my house.
Because I was busy very much .
Every day I must leave home in the morning and come back in the evening.
If I have spare time, I would rather stay at home and o some reading.
Today I suddenly wanted to go to the air garden.
So I did.
Ah!
Only two weeks!
Our air garden has changed a lot.
There were so many yellow leaves on the ground two weeks ago.
Everything looked like sleeping.
Today, any kinds of plants have come up.
The color of the small shoots is light green.
They are soft.
On the other hand, some plants have bloomed.
The colors of the flowers are very beautiful.
There are red, yellow, white, light red and light green.
All the things are new and soft.
You must be comfortable when you come into this green place.
So I was.
I love such feeling as this.
I love the nature, for I can forget all the trouble in it.
Take Good Care Of My Eyes
We had a medical examination this Saturday.
I couldn't be calm until this Saturday.
Because I always worried about my eyes .
My eyesight is not so good.
But I didn't pay attention to this.
So when I knew the examination was coming, I worried that my eyesight would be found worse than before through the examination.
That would be a bad news for my parents and me.
I said to myself: 'If I pass the examination, I will take good care of my eyes.
' At last, the report of examination told me that my eyesight was the same as before.
How excited I felt at that time!
But at the same time, I found most of my classmates' eyesight was not so good.
his was a bad thing.
Were we too hard at study?
I decide to take good care of my eyes.
I hope my classmates are the same as me.
I hope that I needn't worry about my eyesight in the next medical examination.
A group of English students will visit our school.
So the eadmaster gives me a report about the English students' action, and let me tell them what they will do in the coming days.
So I introduce that.
In the afternoon they will be invited to visit the scientific building and the library.
On Tuesday they will visit the Great Wall with our school students.
Mr Zhang will tell us the interesting thing about the Great Wall.
We can talk about the experience and ideas of the study with each other.
On Thursday they will leave for Xi An by train at 9:45.
Learning How To Ride Bike.
So my dad decided to teach me.
From then on, he taught me after he went home every day.
I didn't stop learning.
So two weeks later, I could ride bike without my dad's help.
I was much careful and I said to myself from time to time:' Take it easy!
Take it easy'.
I will succeed!
My dad always noticed me, but he didn't help me when I was in trouble.
He only said to me that I should look ahead in stead of looking at the bike.
At last, we went home safely.
My dad praised me and I was excited very much.
I succeeded!
My mum smiled and asked me if I was so worried just now.
I pretended to be calm and said "no".
but my father said: 'A lying girl.
But I was worried more than you.
'
April 26th.
"Hello!
It's Huang Xiao dan speaking.
" " Hello!
It's Xuan Yun sheng.
" I asked.
I only want to talk with you.
Are you free now?
" she said.
"I'm doing homework now.
" I smiled and answered.
"That's great!
I went shopping with my mum last night.
Can you guess what has appened?
" she asked.
"Ah, I often see and hear these things.
Did a thief steal a man's wallet?
" I guessed.
" Oh, no.
why they fought was a man knocking the other's shoulder .
" She said.
They really make all the Guang zhou's people disappointed very much.
May.
6th.
I'm doing my homework at this moment.
But I'm thinking about another thing --- the three holidays which has just passed.
Our study is hard and we are often busy.
So I thought my holidays would be relaxing and wonderful at first.
But in fact I didn't feel happy in these days.
For what?
Because --- because I have done a wrong thing .
My mum's heart was sad.
I should not have done the wrong thing.
She loves me deeply.
I'm sure that she will pardon me.
But I can't pay off what I have done.
It is no use regretting what has been done now.
May 12th.
Our headmaster Wang died.
I couldn't imagine that he left this world so fast.
All the people said that he devoted himself to our school's development and he was respected by the teachers and students.
I knew this.
But what he impressed upon me wasn't this.
In my heart I always thought he was a very kind man as if he wouldn't scold his students.
Finishing his talk, he went and sat down near me.
He asked us how we studied and if we would continue studying in the NO.4 Middle School.
How kindly he said!
He only asked and collected our ideas, and he didn't order us to do anything.
At last he encouraged us and wished us would get a very good result.At that time I was thinking that he was like our friend more than our headmaster.
All the things have passed.
It only remains some memory.
But this is enough to encourage us studying hard.
My New School
Being a new student, I went to my new school and felt excited.
Because my new school was large very much, and there were many big trees around it .
One was for our experiments, the other two were for our having classes.
Look!
There were some students playing basketball on it.
n fact, I always took pride in my new school.
Because it was a key school and it had a history of seventy years .
So I thought that the teachers must be very good and they were strict with their students.
Since there were such good teachers, the students must be clever and respect their teachers.
My New School
My new school is a key school which has a history of 70 years.
There were many famous men and women graduating from my school.
My new school is beautiful and big.
There are so many big trees around it.
It has two teaching buildings, one lab building and a big playground on which some students are doing exercises.
In my new school, the teachers are very good and strict with us.
So we respect them.
Dear Peter: We're so glad you're coming to join us on Sunday.
Here is how you can find us.
Crossing the bridge, you should turn to the right, and you can see a small hill which is not far away.
Then you keep on going towards it.
June, 14 Sunny
It is nearly thirty centigrade this afternoon.
So hot the day is!
I see that there are about seven to eight children swimming in the river.
They are mostly good at swimming.
Look!
A little girl is learning how to swim with her mother's help.
I like swimming, too.
I used to swim in my childhood.
At that time I was spending my holiday in Beijing.
The days in June are very hot, but I like them.
I believe that June is one of the best months in a year.
Our Monitor
Our monitor's name is Zhang Wei hua.
He is seventeen.
He is not only our monitor but also the head of our school's football team.
So he is strong very much .
As a league member, he respects teachers and often helps us when we are in trouble.
He is active to join our school's actions.
What a good league member he is!
A piece of advice
But how to do is a problem.
"Make notes" is different to "Take notes.
But we must also "Make notes".
What the teacher said is more important than those on the blackbord.
I hope everyone "Make notes", but not "Take notes".
Please keep the school clean.
It is easy for us to do it.
Pay attention yourself.
Don't throw the waste on the floor, throw it into the dustbin.
I think some time later, our school will turn clean.
Also you can think if we don't do that, the rubbish will do harm to our health.
Let us try our best to keep our school clean.
Guang zhou's weather always changes.
Do you agree with me?
I think some say "yes" and some say "no".
For example, the day you went out, the weather was good, the sun was shinning, you enjoyed it very much.
How foolish you re!
The sport's spirit
But in the meeting, I found the ports spirit.
I didn't know him, but his spirit deeply marked n my heart.
I still remembered the thing.
By and by he as left to the end.
His sweat droped down.
He wiped the sweat away and went on running.
All the people were shouting at him and encouraged him.
He didn't give up.
He did what he could to raise himself.
His spirit had already in everyone's heart.
I and my book
The book about science can tell me the strange thing I don't know.
The book is also like a teacher.
Do you like reading books?
My friend
Last week I was walking in the street.
Suddenly I heard a voice : " Hi, How are you?
" I stopped and turned around.
Oh, it is my old classmate.
Now he isn't my classmate, but I still remember him.
In the afternoon, he left.
Before he left, he gave me his new address, and new telephone number.
I was so happy because I could meet him again.
He is always my good friend.
Mid-exam.
We will have a mid-exam in a week.
How diligent they are!
We will also try hard and try to do the best.
because we think we are always the best .
Autumn's trip
This autumn we went to Xie chao Hill for the trip.
Last Saturday, the weather was good, the sun was shining.
How beautiful Xie Chao Hill is!
The hill and the lake were green, they looked nice.
We held a high breath, the wind was so cool that we were feld very good.
Clock
I have a clock.
He is my good friend.
He has a round face.
He has three hands which move around day and night.
So he is so busy all the time.
His spirit is worth studying.
He is just like a model.
he decided to give it to the government.
The professor didn't trust them and gave them some wrong papers.
To he police surprise, the professor said it was not necessary, because the papers he gave them were wrong, he still got the papers on his invention.
English.
English is the most important language in the world.
We must try our best to improve it.
You must speak English and only English can make people understand.
English is also useful in our country.
we must work hard at English.
Computer.
Computer is a modern machine.
Computer improves quickly.
Computer will have deep effect on my life.
A new year.
1997 will come in three days.
Now, I wish everyone happy new year.
In the new year, I will do best than the last .
I'm a student so I will try hard in my lesson.
It is important for us to do it better.
The exams have deep effect on my life.
I think it is easy to say but hard to do.
But I also think e will do it better than last, because we're always the best.
The Spring Festival
The spring Festival is the important day in China.
When it comes, people begin going shopping and doing cleaning.
On that day, people get up early and put on their new clothes.
The younger greet the older.
The older give " lucky money" to the younger.
They visit each other and their friends.
During these days, people all enjoy themselves.
This month is a memorable month.
I will never forget him.
The shoot sways in the wind.
It looks like some one is shaking hands with you.
In our biology class, we are not absent minded, we listen carefully and take some note.
By and by, we love biology.
Miss Yu is a ood teacher, she leads s to succeed.
Pollution
When you are walking in the street, you'll feel terrible.
This only because of the poisonous gases .
At the end of the car, the poisonous gases are given off.
The poisonous included CO, SO2, O2 and so on.
These do harm to our life.
Scientists try to find ideas to do with the gases.
For example, Don't permit cars sent out the gases, plant more tree.
I think all the things must be done by the people.
Everyone must try his best to change it by himself.
the sun shines in the morning, but it is a heavy rain in the afternoon.
After raining , the street turns cleaner and cleaner.
The weather is cool and you will feel well.
School's singer.
We all wished them succeed.
The four players tried their best to improve their voice so that they could get the good result.
At the day when he match began .
Finally, Xu Wei feng on the match and he could join the final match.
We wish him succeed in the end.
A chess match.
There will be a chess match in a month.
The computer is made by IBM company.
It can work millions of times in a second.
I think this match is not only a chess match but also a match between a man and a machine.
Computer is made by a man, it can do more work than a man.
But without command, it can do nothing.
So a man is much clever than computer.
The man will win the match at last.
Zhu jiang River Pollution.
This will o harm to our life.
I think you may have a question: why the river turned dirty.
This because of the thing what the people had done .You can see someone throw waist thing to the river sometimes.
The water turns black and tastes bad.
The table tennis's world cup.
In this month, there is a table tennis match in Britain.
This team will try their best to succeed a second time.
Everyone in our country wishes our team succeed again.
Basketball playground
I think playing basketball is good to our health, but playing for a long time is harm to our health.
My New School
Our school is a key school.
It has a history of over seventy years.
Now our school has thirty-six classes, 1800 students and more than 200 teachers and workers in our school .
Our school is big and beautiful.
Around the school there are many trees.
The school has two buildings for teaching, one building for doing experiments.
The teachers in our school are excellent.
A basketball match.
Last week we had a basketball match.
It was an exciting match.
This time our class VS class Four .
They are taller than our class and their technology of basketball is stronger than us sn4,7-0] .So when the match began, they played at high speed x,9-0] .
In fact, our class played well.
How hot today is!
This afternoon, when I was walking along the river, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river.
I used to swim in my childhood.
At that time, I was spending my holiday in Beijing.
I regarded June as a good month for swimming.
THE SPORT I LIKE BEST
The sport I like best is to play table tennis and badminton.
It can make us relaxing.
Playing table tennis or badminton can build our bodies, prevent from getting too fat, and keep us healthy, give us valuable practice in helping the eyes, brain and muscles to work together.
Another, playing table tennis and badminton are also very useful for character-training.
Speaker's Selection
There is a speaker's selection in our school.
Many students take part in it.
Luo Qing Jun and Ye Tia ing also sign up.
The winner will be given the prizes.
I think it will be colourful.
In fact, the speaker's selection is a great valuable amusement or us.
I hope more and more students are able to take part in it.
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS INVENTION
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the country.
He decided to take his papers to London himself, but the trip was too much for him.
Professor was so clever and careful.
He didn't give the real papers to them.
He only gave them some papers put behind some books on the shelf , and they left in a hurry.
Then he explained it to the policemen.
At last, he decided to take the papers to London himself.
WHEN WE LEAN ENGLISH WE MUST DO AS AN ENGLISHMAN
When we learn English we must do as an Englishman.
First, we cannot speak English with our language order .
So we must do as an Englishman when we are learning English, and speak English in English order.
How to speak English with right order?
MY FIRST DANCING
Although we are all hard we think it is very valuable, so we have no murmur.
THE ART FESTIVAL OF SCHOOL FINALS
We are all excited and happy.
The ardent applause sounded again and again.
For example, the student's fashion show and the recital with dancing have never appeared, these have great characterisic.
There are three performance programmes one gets three class and the other two get second class.
My Winter Holiday
My Winter holiday is rich and colorful.
The other is to receive lots of money for " Li shi", it is I like best.
The spring Festival is not only the beginning of a year but also the social intercourse time.
People give the presents to each other and greet each other.
We are enjoying ourselves.
We eat "Tang Yuan" together at home.
The Tang Yuan" is sweet and our hearts are also sweet.
But it is a pity that we are not permitted to fire the Smoking Flower.
Whether it is permitted that must be oven more colourful.
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival is coming!
All over he city is filled with the happy atmosphere.
The people are smiling.
The voices of the them sound like a song.
So people ill go to the Flowers Market at the end of the year.
Although it is raining, people still go to the Flowers Market as before.
All kinds of flowers compete each other.
The big oranges, roses, chrysanthemums are taking a bath in the rain.
They seem very attractive.
The plan of a year is made in Spring.
People will full heart of hopes to meet the new year!
The cripples also can live a happy life in the Spring Festival.
The office of the street has launched a movement to help the cripples live a happy life in the Spring Festival.
They call on the residents to give some money to help the cripples.
The cripples are all great happy and thankful.
They shake hands with the officials tremulously and can't keep back their tears.
Such is the socialist society!
Each country cannot exist lonely.
We should study each other.
I think we should change the rule for education.
Some of them are uninteresting.
For example, Hong Kong's students are learning the practical English, such as the letters for job, reports, and so on.
although we have never learned these .
So it is necessary to study each other and change our old rules for education.
I greatly regretted that I had failed in the exam.
I had never failed in the English exam since my learning English.
The 56.5 being written on the paper, I can't believe in my eyes.
I thought I was sorry to Miss Lin and myself.
Why did I fail in the exam?
Because I had paid no attention to going over the lessons .
In the future, I will try my best to improve my English and get high marks in the each exam!
Be careful of the fire
he main reason is that when a child was playing the TV game .
he wires were suddenly shortcut.
Pay attention to reading.
There are two sorts of reading.
One is to read aloud, the other is to read the compositions.
Miss Lin had once said in class that reading helped to train language sense.
There will be a hearing test in the examination.
So we should pay more attention to reading.
Stone-Cliz has aid that what you had read.
What you can hear .
English Corner.
Sunday, I looked through the English weekly.
It said that there was an English corner in Shi chuang Cang Xi xian ong hang zheng middle school, every Wednesday afternoon, a free talk in English is held in the reading room after class.
A good many students from different classes and grades attend it.
I envy it very much.
Though there is also an English corner in Zhong shan library, it is far away.
I wish there will e an English Corner in our school reading room before long.
Our School's Education Examination.
Last Wednesday, some leaders came to our school to examine the education work.
In order to welcome the leaders we had cleaned the classroom and the meeting room.
All the students had worked hard.
All the things in the classroom were in good order.
Two leaders had the physics and biology with us together.
The old teacher Dai Qi zheng had gave some advice to the biology teacher.
We were in harmony with teacher and completed the teaching duty.
His teacher had greatly encouraged him and helped him.
Now he can write a letter in English, but he still feels it is limited, and he decides that he will try his best to improve his English.
I'm glade to hear from you and be your pen pal.
I will tell you something about my study.
Now our school has one hundred and thirty teachers and one thousand five hundred students.
Otherwise, we also have the computer language and typing.
In my spare time, I like playing basketball, playing football and reading.
Do you like our school?
I want to know hether your school is as good as our school.
Would you tell me hether your school is as good s our school.
Would you tell me about your school next time?
The best to you!
our pen pal: Zhang Hua.
Welcome to visit our biology lab.
two teachers and laboratory technicians work in it and work hard.
students can have classes and do experiment in the laboratory.
Many students are interested in biology.
After class, they can come here to do experiment.
With the teachers' help, they have learned many useful things.
I live in a small town with long history.
The small town has a population of two million.
It lies near a river, which is at the foot of hills.
There are flowers, grass and trees here and there.
It's very beautiful.
Since 1980, great changes have taken place in the small town.
Many buildings are put up, and a hospital, two schools are also built.
The town takes on a new look so I love the my town and the people.
Be quiet!
Please be quiet!
There is going to be an English speech match at two o'clock next Saturday afternoon I n the library reading room.
You can choose the topic freely, but each one can't speak over ten minutes.
Just the students of Senior Two .
It is a good chance for you.
Don't miss the chance!
My new school.
It is large and surrounded with trees.
It's very beautiful.
There are thirty-six classrooms.
One thousand eight hundred students and over two hundred teachers in it .all the teachers are excellent and strict with students.
Now many students who graduated from the school have become famous people.
Today is my birthday.
In the morning my parents and I went shopping.
Mother bought me a toy doll and a pair of new shoes as my birthday present.
I liked them very much.
At noon, we had a good lunch in a restaurant.
We had a good time.
June the fourteenth.
Today I saw seven-eight children swimming in the river.
A little girl was learning swimming, and her mother taught her.
I thought June was the best months on a year.
I like football very much.
I often play football after school.
Our teacher has us train hard.
Our team to be sure win in nest game .
The spirit of candles
But its spirit is really great.
In the dark, it burns itself, so that it can light all of us.
The light of a andle is as important as a sunbeam.
ur teachers are like the candles.
They spent their life in teaching us.
Candles always don't get their pay from the people, and the teachers give up their life to education.
Their pirit is the same, and we thank them just the same, too.
An elephant and a judge.
This is an interesting story which happened in England in 1994.
There was a football match between Arsenal and Chelsea.
When the watch was going to begin .
Suddenly, an elephant walked into the stadium, and stood in the middle of the ground.
People were all in surprise.
At that time, the elephant played with one football, using its long nose.
One man came near the elephant.
He put up the stick, so that the elephant could see the bananas, and he could tempt it to leave.
This time, he didn't succeed again.
Then, a group of man came.
They tried their best to push the elephant.
But it was big and heavy, nothing could make it to move a little.
At last, a judge came.
He watched the elephant playing the ball for minutes.
Then he thought, " The elephant must be interested in football.
Maybe it knows the rules, too".
he judge took out a red card to the elephant.
The judge smiled and announced the match was beginning.
Love our class
Recently, my classmate Feng Yu jing goes to school early in the morning.
Does he do so in order to get more time to study?
No.
The sports meeting will begin this Friday.
Feng Yuying will take part in 1,500 metres running.
Now, he is active in practice.
It shows that he deeply hopes to be the best, to win for our class.
Feng Yu Ying is very good, all of us should learn from him.
Football in our Class.
They not only often played football inside and outside the school.
Very much as many boys liked it, our class football team was not the best one in four classes.
At that time, Liang Jian ling was a leader, that is to say, he was the captain of our class football team.
But he did not lead the team to get the champion.
This made everybody sad.
No one scolded them, because they had done their best, defeat looked reasonable.
Before long, there will be a football match between Class Four and our class.
On that day, victory is ours.
Why He Didn't Finish Homework
and it was the nglish homework that he did not finish.
But, it was impossible hat he did so in order to make our headteacher angry.
Then why he did so .
I wanted to know.
I thought and thought, and at last I found out a reason to explain.
Because his other name is " BEAR'' .
As we know from the fifth lesson, bear is a beast which half-hibernates.
I hope this article can make Liang Jian ling " wake up", and make others joy.
Particular Friends.
It has passed four weeks since we knew each other.
On these days, we get on well.
we usually study, talk together, and even play games together.
The majority of the class like them very much.
Today, we have to say good- bye to them.
Before leaving, they give us a perfect football.
Because they know we all like playing football .We will look on the football as an expensive present and keep it well.
The Main Idea of " Zhu Fu"
It was a novel which was written by Lu Xun, the famous writer.
The main character in this novel was Xiang Lin Sao.
She fled.
She went to Lu Town, and worked for a landlord.
Because she was not lazy, the owner liked her.
But not long later, her husband's mother sent two men to kidnap her back.
She was forced to remarry and then had a son.
Two years later, her second husband died, her only son was eaten by the wolves.
Xiang Lin Sao went to Lu Town again.
But some one laughed at her and the owner drove her out.
She became a beggar, and she believed in spirits.
She looked frightful.
At last, she died before new year... How wretched she was!
Collective Cohesion .
But the blemish in an otherwise perfect thing is it lacks cohesion.
Once, the head teacher asked us, " Who is willing to carry the mud from the botanical garden?
" no one answered.
How weird!
Why we haggle over every ounce in serving it?
Some students in our class come from the other class.
We permit they miss the old one, and we absolutely don't permit they look on the new one --- our class as an inn.
Collective cohesion is very important to us.
Having it, we would o on progressing.
Electioneering
This Monday, our head teacher announced that one electioneering about class cadres would be held next week.
The class cadres have not been changed in general since our new head teacher assumed office.
Some of them discharged their duty all along, but a handful of them was in office only in name .
Retell the Play.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the government.
But he wasn't strong enough to go to London himself.
So the government sent two men to take the papers.
The men would come at eleven.
Only at half past ten, two men came.
They claimed to be sent by the government.
They looked too nervous and were too anxious to leave.
Professor Hunter was very careful in important things.
He distrusted the two men.
So he gave another papers to them, not the true one.
They accepted, and left in a hurry.
That is to say, the two men who came a moment ago were impostors.
Before long, inspector White and Sergeant Bull came to investigate.
Letter of Accusation.
" Now , I'm going to exercise the right of accusation.
The week before last, when I wanted to add a note about football to the back blackboard, the propagandist unexpectedly extorted one yuan from me for this.
Because he was a bureaucrat, I had to be extorted.
Though the money he extorted is little, the effect is very big.
All of us don't need such a class cadre.
The head teacher must do something to punish the propagandist, in order to stop this kind of thing happening.
f the head teacher were not to give me a reasonable answer or overrule this letter of accusation, I would complain to the school.
At that time, the head teacher will also be a defendant.
Our P.E.
teacher
Our P.E.
He perhaps is in his twenties, but he looks as if he were about forty years old.
hy?
Because his face doesn't match his age.
As he always speaks the common spoken Chinese, we all think that he is a man who comes from another province.
" He gets on well with others, " our head teacher describes our P. E. teacher like this.
Is it right on earth?
Publish opinion will decide which is right and which is wrong.
May our head teacher represent the public?
The answer is clear.
Objective fact can't be denied.
Let us wait and see.
All the students, love our P.E.
teacher, please.
I think you all can do that, because he is really lovely.
Right?
Innocent
Our classmates are very innocent.
They don't know here are many sinister men in the world.
In the preliminary contest of this Art Festival, several classmates, who took part in it, were deceived and betrayed.
In singing song, three boys was active in practising before the preliminary contest.
They thought, this must be the capital that they score a success.
They also met Teacher Wu chun pei, one of the judges, in order to enter the finals without a hitch.
Altogether, they thought they were able to enter the 90 per cent sure.
But the result was that they were betrayed by Wu Chunpei, they were sifted out.
In a short, we were deceived by the judges more obviously.
We lost very wrongly.
But now, only two.
A all into the pit, a gain in your wit.
Let us remember: depend more on ourselves, need no others' giving alms.
Don't be too innocent.
Once, he said to the king of the Tang Dynasty, " I hope you let me be a good subject, not a loyal subject.
" The king asked why he said so.
Wei Zheng replied, " The good subject assists the monarch to administer a country, they get on well with each other, then the monarch will enjoy a good reputation.
the loyal subject is killed by the monarch, because he admonishes the monarch, then the monarch will get a bad reputation.
" Miss in, I hope that you will enjoy a good reputation.
I had ulterior motives to write to the vice-head teacher.
Liang iang ling was taken advantage of.
I expected that he would take the " etter" to you.
nstead, I wrote it in order to remind you and all the classmates.
I know, this " letter" has hurt you greatly, I have gone too far.
Here, I say sorry to you.
At last, I wish you can make unremitting efforts to improve ourself, use your wisdom to lead us.
Why I can succeed in this exam?
I have succeed in this examination doubtless.
Why can I do so?
Some classmates even think that no pressure is no impetus.
Altogether, the pressure comes from three ways: society, family and school.
In this exam, my pressure comes from the teacher mainly.
Before the exam, the head teacher had a talk with me.
She demanded that I should set an example in study to all the boys who like playing football.
From then on, I felt that I had weighty responsibility.
My Winter Holiday
My winter holiday in 1997 bores me to tears.
I have a bad opinion of it.
I would rather go to school than have holidays.
In these days, I have not a delightful holiday, but a tragic experience.
How poor I am!
Because the heavy study assignment ties me .
Even in the holidays,I am unable to extricate my self from it either.
In short, my winter holiday is dull.
I believe that all the classmates have the same opinion, only the teachers will feel happy in the holiday.
The Spring Festival
Someone thinks that the Spring Festival is a festival for the children.
I even find that with the passage of time, the festive air is not warm any more.
But my parents still pay more attention to the Spring Festival.
They buy many potted flowers to decorate our house, such as hyacinth, azalea, chrysanthemum, narcissus and winter daphne.
Because it is warm in the winter, the flowers bloom early.
Fortunately my father thinks of a way to prevent the flowers from blooming early, so that they can keep pace with the Spring Festival.
For example he put the narcissus which is going to bloom into the icebox.
God save me!
Piece of Good News
In Tian jin, some teacher did what the students must do all day long; getting to school on time, having several lessons, and so on are the students' school living.
This is a piece of good news, because it can set people thinking, including teachers, parents and educational experts.
And the students seem to keep silent temporarily, because they really have no alternative.
The Petrel Golgi ...
The dark clouds get darker and darker, lower and lower, and press to the sea .
The waves are singing, at the same time, they are rushing to the sky, going to welcome the thunder .
The thunder roars.
The waves shout in the form, ontending with the fierce wind.
Look!
The petrel is shouting and flying, like the black lighting.
He flies across the dark clouds like an arrow.
His wing shims over the waves.
Look!
He is dancing in the air, like a spirit --- a supercilious, thunderous spirit.
He is laughing, and he is howling.
He is laughing at the dark clouds.
He is howling because of happiness.
This sensitive spirit, early feels tired in the thunder.
He believes that the dark clouds cannot cover the sun --- YES!
CANNOT COVER.The fierce wind is shouting.
The thunder is roaring.
The dark clouds, like the blue fire, are burning on the bottomless sea.
These lightning's shadow, like the burning snakes, is swimming in the sea, soon disappears.
The storm!
The storm is coming!
This is the brave petrel.
He is superciliously flying on the sea, in the lightning.
This is a voice from the successful prophet: LET THE STORM COME MORE VIOLENTLY!
Confrontation.
This week, the grade master have had a special talk with us.
Ten days ago, we had a grade meeting.
In the meeting, the grade master talked about how to manage the relation between boy students and girl students correctly.
Though our grade master has really given much thought to the matter, some of my classmates do not agree with her.
They are disgusted with what she said.
On the other hand, the grade master is unhappy after she perceives this.
So she thinks that it is very necessary to talk about this problem to us again.
Last term, we ever troubled the grade master.
So the grand aster had to explain to us.
But sometimes we would think that she's a busy body.
The "confrontation" between the grade master and us, shows the universal contradiction between teachers and students.
That is to say, this "confrontation" is normal.
Talk
In last week's English composition, chen zhi jie wrote an article to appraise what our grade master had done through discussion.
His words were extreme, and the head master prevented him from continuing his article in time, but I found that some classmates thought highly of the article after they had read it.
Last term, Chen ever told me such a thing: The grade master had a talk with him for one sentence on the blackboard newspaper.
She thought that Chen censured the school for doing injustice through that sentence.
Chen was baffled.
From then on, the relationship between the grade master and Chen turned bad.
So it isn't strange that he regarded her as a tiger this time.
I have not been for Chen all along, including this time.
But, since so many classmates agree with him, one of our class cadres, I must remind the head teacher that something will be done by them before long.
Tired
Only five hours ago, I still did my homework in the lamplight.
I wrote and wrote, but it seems that the homework cannot be finished for ever.
So I am very tired now.
I don't know when the days like this will end.
Perhaps no end .
After the unified state examination, something else must wait for me.
I have to suffer hardships again... Now, it is a quarter to seven, I have to hurry to school with my weary body.
Understand Each Other
Why the students do not all agree with what their teacher said?
Why do they sometimes get on badly with their teacher?
I think it is because the students and their teacher have different opinions.
For example, some boys like playing football, because they all think they can enjoy themselves from it.
In fact, everyone must have his unique opinion.
And his opinion cannot be changed easily.
If one can't do these, it seems that he is a puppet.
This kind of man who is easily manipulated by others is not useful.
One of them must think that he himself is reasonable, and others are right, too.
Harmful Slogan
There is a slogan that " We're always the BEST" on our class badge.
It has done great harm to us.
From then on, we made few preparations for struggling.
We believed that we were really the best and no one could triumph over us.
We slacked off in our studies.
In short, we have lost much because of this slogan.
We must hurry to annul this slogan in order to let all of us realize ourselves correctly.
When we do so, we are full of hope of success.
Streamline Administration.
When they have a meeting outside the classroom, they often make great noise.
Because they sometimes have different ideas .
I dare not say that some cadres are unfit for their office.
They usually care more for themselves than for others.
perhaps they think that their study will get bad if they do more work for the people.
And it is clear that they find no good ways to manage the class.
For example, the propagandist was ever scolded by the head teacher because of his extolling freedom of speech.
This week, our monitor is also scolded for he plays basketball till night.
The head teacher has to give a lot of care to manage the cadres.
Here, I suggest streamlining administration.
My New Friend
Wu Zhi cong is my new friend.
Both of us were born in the year of the monkey.
He is the youngest boy in our class.
Do you know why I made friends with him?
Cong looks innocent and lively because he is young.
At ordinary times, when I get along with other classmates, I find there is a strong smell of gun powder among us.
Some of the classmates have already fought for the study in a terrible fix.
The have already been the fighting machines.
I believe Cong and I wouldn't be like them.
Perhaps youth is our capital.
We can deal with our study and daily life correctly.
Getting along with him, I feel very happy.
So I decide to make friends with him.
Wu Zhing cong is a clever fat boy, and I'm a boy who is full of worry.
We must help each other.
I wish our friendship will endure as the universe.
Homeland
The People's Republic of China lies in the east of Asia and to the west of the Pacific.
Her area is nine million ix hundred thousand square kilometres.
There are more than one point two billion people in our homeland.
She's a unitary multi-national state.
Her terrain is tall in the west and low in the east.
The topography is complicated.
Our homeland is very beautiful.
As the time goes on, she gets stronger and stronger.
Just then, the Chinese people can live and work in peace and contentment.
Now, we are working hard for this object.
Our homeland's tomorrow must be better.
Walk.
On May the second, some of our classmates went to visit the Bai yun Hill.
After the event, the head teacher also admitted that she had never walked such a long way in her life.
Yes, her view is right.
That is why I am glad to walk more than four kilometres to go to school each day.
In fact, when I am not happy, I will go out for a long walk.
Wandering in the street, I will forget the unhappy matter.
But walking too long will do harm to us.
Let's go on walking, and every step leaves its print.
But, don't choose the wrong way again.
A Pair of Special Playing Cards.
This pair of playing cards were very expensive.
They were also of great value--- commemorative value.
I will keep this pair of special playing cards well for ever.
It made our head teacher very angry that some classmates cared m ore for playing basketball than studying.
But, does she notice that some of the class cadres are connected with these matters.
First, on one Tuesday evening, some classmates even played basketball on the playground till half past nine.
It was Feng Yu jing that took part in it, too.
When they saw the head master coming, Feng fled the fastest on his bike.
Finally, he has also been caught.
Several days later, two cadres, Liang jia chao and Mai Zirui made the same mistake.
These three cadres have already made self-criticisms facing the classmates.
Since the cadres made the same mistake continuously, it is not strange that ordinary students wouldn't obey the rule.
" As we know, the class cadres are the arms of the head teacher's.
Now, the arms are broken.
This will do harm to the headmaster and all of us!
Dear head teacher, LOOK OUT!
There is a saying, Haste makes waste, in old times.
One of the reasons is that the everything in the world has its own regularity.
We have to comply with it and can not change it.
The national economic also has its own regularity.
Today our government adopted the open and reform policy.
The people's living conditions are much improved.
The people's educational level rised.
That haste makes waste is known to everyone in China.
Whatever we do, we must remember it.
Then he will waste his time and get nothing.
So people will do everything.
Second, haste will make people's mood bad.
Obviously he needs more time and becomes slower .
Like this, we call, Haste makes waste.
Such examples are many.
A proverb says "haste makes waste".
It says very well.
Every thing has its own way.
It is impossible for him to study well in one month.
For another instance: you want to be a singer .
You should get up early and practise singing every day.
Only keep on practising for a long time, you will make a greater progress.
It needs patience and persistence in doing a thing.
In my opinion: no pains, no gains.
In my opinion, the famous saying is a good advice to us.
You will succeed.
"Haste makes waste" is a principle.
If you hurry to do something, you can't do it well.
For example the ring strikes, but you can't find your book, so you look for it.
When you stop to think for a while, you possibly find it easily.
For another example, studying English is a good one.
It isn't a good way to do something in a hurry.
You should do it patiently and slowly, which will help you to get what you want.
No one can deny the proverb.
Haste makes waste.
For example: a very young baby, as we all know, can't walk very well.
He walks slowly.
He throws himself to the ground now and then.
Every one learns to walk in childhood.
From the above we can conclude that without preparing can't make a success.
I have the opinion that haste makes waste.
Don't you think so?
There is a famous saying "Haste makes waste".
But why?
There are some reasons for that.
First, we have no time thinking about the thing, before we start to do it because of haste.
Third, it may take us much more time to do a thing with haste than do it carefully.
Finally, we would waste a lot of time and money because of haste.
We have to return home for it.
But why they say "Haste Makes Waste"?
So when you finish the work, you will find the consequence is not good.
People always say "Haste makes waste".
It's just like a baby, before he is able to run fast, he must learn how to walk slowly, or he will fall down and hurt himself.
He may feel exhausted but he must keep on learning.
Everyone needs time to learn.
Maybe you are clever, but you can not accomplish a task without working hard.
Then you can complete it in no trouble.
Please remember "haste makes waste".
One proverb says: "Haste makes waste".
Why say so?
It goes as following.
First, haste makes mistakes.
If you want to finish one thing quickly you might be very nervous.
You think of the consequence when you are doing it.
Second, haste makes inefficient.
So we say "Haste makes waste".
You may quickly make up and rush out, but finally you find that you forget to ask the address of your friend.
For students it is common.
In conclusion, haste makes a person nervous and then easily makes mistakes.
So "Haste makes waste".
There is a saying in China that "Haste makes waste".
It is correct to say so.
But the saying is reasonable.
When we are in a hurry, we may remember one thing but forget another thing.
We're so hasty that we can't do things well.
You'll be late for school in the morning.
So you get up quickly and eat breakfast quickly.
It is certain that you are late for school.
There are many examples about how haste makes waste in the daily life.
We may take these lessons.
It is not what we wish.
And want to do it well.
You should know how difficult the task is, and which kinds of things you should do.
You only want to "haste", forget to do the fundamental factor.
Only do the main factor.
Perhaps you should do nothing.
If you only learn some word and want to read the newspaper or make a sentence or write article.
You want to learn the English quickly, forget the fundamental factors.
You can learn the English well.
Do anything well you should do fundamental job first, then do the main part of the thing.
You should do it well.
We all know this sentence "haste makes waste".
There are many examples to explain "haste makes waste".
Why we say so?
The accident will waste our time then we can't get there on time.
So we must remember it---haste makes waste.
It teaches us that we should obey the natural rules and consider our situation when we do anything.
But in fact you will always get a bad result if you act too eagerly.
Everything you want to do well, but everything is not under your control.
So you will fail in the end.
This is the reason why haste makes waste.
So I turned up the oven firstly, then looked for the salt.
But no matter how anxious I was, I couldn't find the salt and other useful thing.
At last, I could do nothing but turn off the oven in case it would be on fire.
Everything was worse than I could expect.
In China there is a proverb: Haste makes waste.
For example, we will climb a hill.
It's impossible for us to stand on the top of hill at once, we must climb step by step, aimed at the top of hill and worked hard.
Through continuing effort, the top became nearer, the distance that we have walked is longer and longer.
Sometimes it's right, but sometimes it's wrong.
That haste makes waste is a phenomenon.
They don't want to waste time in the line and they want to buy good tickets.
Finally, they don't buy good tickets but they spend more time to go out of the crowded people.
It's a trivial thing in my life.
But I can learn about the rule "Haste makes waste".
Everyone should know about the ancient Chinese saying: "Haste makes waste".
It means that if you want to achieves success at once, you would fail probably.
Now, let me tell you the reason.
I'll show you examples in order to make you understand.
Do you hear of the story about "Jin attacks Song".
But in that night, it rained.
Someone persuaded the leader to give up the attack.
So they started.
They were defeated.
Only considering the speed is not appropriate.
No pains, no gains.
Only with words you can't get to the bank of success.
We must work hard and advance step by step.
The prospect of our country is beautiful.
Please remember "haste makes waste.
" Doing everything , you should look before you leap.
An old saying has it that haste makes waste.
If you want to do something, you should do it step by step.
And if you want to fasten your speed, you do it quickly, then maybe you'll find that you have missed something.
And it takes you more time.
In daily life, we often meet with such things.
"When you are doing your work", they said, "you must engage in it and most important, you must be careful!
Once our English teacher told me a story.
Suddenly, the bunches of books scattered and in the end, the young man couldn't enter the city.
And this is the meaning of the old saying "Haste makes waste".
We should learn from it and do things cautiously, step by step.
Time is very important.
If you only try to hurry up, a lot of factors may be forgotten or pay not much attention to .
So there is a saying "Haste makes waste.
I have not read a single word until May.
Needless to say, I have failed.
Only did I know the saying or another "Rome was not built in a day" was the time when I was being tested !
Many people think haste makes success.
We must learn it for half a year and even more.
Otherwise, haste makes waste.
On the other hand, if we want success at once.
Where the basis comes from?
We do exercise, learn to speak, write and so on.
If we never do these before, how could we do a thing successfully and rapidly.
On the one hand, some people go in for doing a kind of job all through their lives.
On the other hand, some people like changing jobs frequently.
It calls for people to master it through practicing.
Many people are unemployed for the lack of technology.
We are fit for more jobs.
When one grows up, he must face up to work.
I think that different people have different views.
Because they have been used to these jobs which have made them master some skills.
So they dislike to change jobs.
They think that different jobs can make them know more skills and people.
They may hold many opportunities to develop their specialization, learn new knowledge, and so on.
My view on job-hopping is that I may usually change my job until I'm satisfied with it.
And I can do well.
In these days, we may change our jobs constantly for all kinds of reasons.
They think that doing one job for long time, they may get lots of experience from it and do it better and better.
They think that only do many jobs, can they find which one they like most and they may have more skills, meet more people and know more.
I think if you like your jobs.
If you disgust it, you may change it and look for better ones.
But be careful, you must do everything from the very beginning when you get a new one.
I wonder why they have the different choice.
They think that they can get many experience.
They like chanllege.
They like high salary.
They like to change their work surrounding....
In my view, I like to change my job, but not too often.
I think I can do one job for five years, and then change my job to do other job eg.
to do some business or ad.
For example, my father has worked as a worker in a factory for twenty five years, and he is still loving his job.
While, other people like to change their job frequently.
And, as soon as we take up a job, in spite of our enjoying, we should try our best to do it well, and try to be more and more skilled in our own job.
Because they have one ideal in usual.
For example, one person' ideal is becoming a doctor, and now he is a doctor.
Then, he will do the same job for ever.
After a long time, they will feel the job is not interesting.
They like changing jobs very often.
Everyone has different life style.
Some people like doing the same job, and others like changing their job very often.
I think we have not enough reason to say good or bad.
In general, there are two reasons first, they enjoy the job very much, or they are interested in the job.
After graduation, they want to go further into study.
Some people often like changing the job.
They may like the challenging work style.
My view on job-hopping is that I can always take on a kind of job if I can apply for a proper job.
Furthermore, we may have a good command of job.
Meanwhile, we should grab the chance to train ourselves and to improve ourselves.
Maybe for the purpose of making a living, almost everyone must work for society so that he can earn enough money needed by him.
some think it is better to do the same job all the time.
They believe that for one thing, the longer you practice it the better you do, likewise, others think it is better to change your job constantly.
So we must analyze own characteristics when we choose our jobs.
Some people like to do one work all the time.
Some people like to change works often.
And they can do the work well as they do before.
But some just don't like the work they do and they can't do any work for a long time, so they change the work often.
My view on job-hopping is the first view of the two is right.
Some people have been in the same job for their life.
Why?
There are all kinds of reasons.
For example, some are good at the job, they wouldn't change it.
It is easy to deal with problems in work or life.Furthermore, the others want to change the job, owning to the need of work etc., they have to continue his job.
Some people would like to change their jobs constantly.
In the addition, maybe they didn't like the old job.
Maybe they long for high salary and equal opportunity.
They think new jobs are fit for them.
On the contrary, if you like present job, you are satisfied with it.
You shouldn't change it like others.
You will become a proficient employee.
As usual, in order to make a life, it is necessary for one to have a job.
But, someone likes working for one job throughout his life.
On the other hand, someone likes changing his job constantly.
The people who are not willing to do the same job change their jobs after a period of time.
At the same time, he is looking for the job catering to him.
I think this is usually done by young people.
I am a student going to graduate.
Unchanging jobs is suitable for the persons who are at the age of 40s or older, for they should have steady lives for their later lives.
People hold many views on job-hopping.
I'm the second class.
It just like the monkey pick the corn.
"Do it well or give it up!
" it's my view on job-hopping.
After graduated, everyone is faced on such problem as hunting a job.
Then, what's your view on Job-Hopping?
They think if you do a job for a long time, little by little, you can be good at it.
Then, it is more possible for you to do some achievements.
Because they think if they do many kinds of jobs, they can obtain many kinds of knowledge and experience from it.
doing a job forever.
Because I want to succeed in one field.
The job is very important to all of the people.
Because they like this job and prefer to contribute their lives to the job.
Because they think what do all kinds of jobs is a challenge to themselves.
I think it is important to find a position suitable to me.
Job-Hopping is a thought of one's future work.
What type of job should I take?
People have different views.
Some one likes to do only one job for his whole life.
He can devote his whole life to the job, so he may make great achievement in his field.
On the other hand, some people like to change his job for a short time.
Secondly, he likes to challenge.
In my opinion, when and how to change one's job should be decided by the present things.
We should adjust our directions according to the requirements of the society.
Similarly, if the job does not prove my ability, why should not I look for another job?
Job-Hopping is an interesting thing.
What do you think?
For example, in Japan, if you work more time than others, you will have more chance to get high rank, and good salary.
Why is it?
Because those people have the different thought.
If you ask what's my option, I can tell you that I will change my job sometimes before 30.
After this, I will do a job that I love for a long time.
It is my view on Job-Hopping.
What do you think about it?
So they can do their things that they like to do in their spare time.
They always like to change their jobs.
Because they think they will find the value and the interest of the life through changing the job.
You only to be on punctual to wok and do work good, better and best.
I always think person wherever he be, the most important is to realize his or her value.
Because they think that is interesting and can study much knowledge.
The second view is my view on Job-Hopping.
Through my activities, I study many means of answering some questions.
My ability is made much progresses.
Now, I can live alone and needn't my parents' help.
?
Under the situation of reforming and opening, we are facing an important problem--job.
Some would like to go in for only one job in their lives, perhaps because they love their jobs very much.
They devote themselves to their jobs.
They want to research further so that they get more achievements.
Everyone has his(her) own job when he(she)grows up.
There are many people who like to do only one job in his whole life.
My view on job-hopping is that one should better do one job only in one's life.
Then he(she) can find ways to improve the job.
So he can meet many difficulties in his job.
And then he will not do the job easily.
I wish that you would do your own job well in your life.
In life, some people like taking up the same job only.
While, the others are fond of changing jobs constantly.
Personally, I don't think that we should encourage people to change jobs or discourage them from doing so.
Every one must have something to do.
But how long does he do the job is a problem.
Usually, there are three reasons.
First, some of them like their jobs very much.
While some people like to change their jobs often.
There are two reasons in common.
One is their jobs aren't fit for him.
Then we get a job to realize our goals.
So we shouldn't change our work often, except they are really not fit for realizing our goals.
There are different views on Job-Hoping.
Someone would like to take up the same job for a long time, even in his life.
Moreover, staying in the same position will lead to lower efficiency.
We often talk about our job-hopping together.
They often said they did not like to change their jobs.
So when you work just first, you can't change it.
It is the most important thing you find your value in your work.
But not change your job.
And this phenomenon in particular to newly graduated college students for they are so ambitious and not easily satisfied.
They keep on jumping for every chance.
Some people always work on a job.
They think if a person works in a company all the time he will look on the company as his home.
And he will work hard for the company.
Then the company will be developing.
In fact, this case is disadvantage to be, because he isn't patient to work it.
Otherwise, there are some people who like to often change jobs.
They think they will not live a good life is his company is in bad condition.
One hand , some of them like doing one job without changing.
Because they are used to that job, and they can finish the same work smoothly within the limited time.
Which makes them work more efficiently.
They believe new jobs are more attractive for them.
Everybody should choose one on principle his own feeling.
If you are a stable man.
Because a stable job makes you satisfied and feel safe.
However, if you are an active man, you may more like the latter in that new jobs give you a chance to challenge.
Finally, I concluded that a person should often change his job when he was young and in his old age, he would be stable.
Our government is no longer responsible for arranging it.
Considerable number of us intend to perform one job in their lives.
On the other hand, others don't think so.
They prefer variable work to the same one.
The new things are challenging to them.
When they find that a job isn't fit for them, they hope to get a new one.
Thus, they can show their abilities brilliantly.
Gaining a job is much more important to everyone of us.
They want a stable job and a stable income.
So they choose a single job in their lives.
On the other hand, some people like to change their jobs often.
They want to earn a lot of money to improve their life conditions.
I think it maybe right.
First of all they feel like going at their jobs and they feel very excited when they are working.
Some people often like to change their jobs.
Especially some young people they want to have a wide sky to fly freely like a bird.
But my opinion is different from them.
On one hand, I should study hard, harder and hardest.
Once I choose a job I will love it and do it well.
But in these days it is very difficult to find a good job for oneself.
So I think whatever we do, above all, we should try to make us love the job.
If we want to live, we would have to work.
In this period, I like the challenge.
This is my view on Job-Hopping.
But each has his own Job-Hopping.
They doing their own business as hard as they were.
There still some do not like challenging themselves.
They want a fine house and a warm family to live in.
There are some reasons even they do not know.
In my own view, if I have the job I like, I would do it for a life time.
There still be a way.
You do it for a living, not for playing.
When we are adults, we will look for jobs.
People have different views on the jobs.
Some people like doing a kind of job all time.
To them, begin to do the work first, they are unskilled.
In my view, one should not often change his job.
If he does it, he will not get skilled about the job and get little.
It is not good to the future.
But I don't agree that one must do some single job in all his life.
Some people like to do only one job in their life-long time.
They get the job in this company for one year and worked in another factory for several months.
Many people like to work on a job from the beginning to the end.
Many people like to change their jobs constantly.
In society, we should have ourselves work to step into it.
Other people are fond of changing different jobs because they want to test their ability.
They want to release their potential by doing different jobs.
When they think the job is not challenging enough to themselves they find another new job.
Some people like calm and simple life so they love to do a job all time.
Other people like adventurous and challenging life.
They want to do some challenging things so they must change work to satisfy themselves.
I like the latter, because I dream of adventurous and challenging life.
In practice, there are many people who would like to be engaged in a type of work.
It is not necessary for them to change their work.
No one can change their ideas.
Because they must change their work when it is not fit for them.
Sometimes they think that they can't show their capacities in their work.
Once we losing it, it won't come again.
While some people like to change their jobs constantly because they find every new job offered them a completely different field.
In the new world they may return to the starting line.
That is to say we can obtain pleasures from our jobs.
On the other hand the job should develop our merits as well.
Everyone in the world should have his view on Job-Hopping.
There are many people who have achievements.
There are other people who like to change their work frequently.
Some of them believe that they will find a good job to fit them.
My view on Job-Hopping is to work hard in one field.
Generally-- speaking, two views can often occur.
Some prefer to do a job in all his life.
There are two reasons, I think.
Secondly, he is afraid that the next one is worse, after all it needs enough courage and ability.
Some prefer to change jobs often.
In the world there are some people and some kinds of jobs.
He thinks that one should always like his job and work for it for his life.
This kind of man is lively.
Furthermore, it is a waste of time for one from a familiar job, to another unfamiliar job.
There is not a good job or bad.
People live in the world must be work for themselves and for society.
They may choose adequate jobs freely and they may have different views about job.
There are some people who do one job throughout the working-time.
Because they think it can make them skillful.
They will be familiar with the work process.
While there are other views about job-hopping.
Some people like to work in different regions, they think that different jobs can provides different skills and can challenge in different aspects.
Also some people work too long time about one job which will be tired of.
They need change job frequently.
My view on job-hopping is to work on one job, also to be familiar with other skills with which we should familiar for our work and life.
Even they change working place to do the same job.
On the other hand, there are many people who often change their work.
I agree with the latter.
For a serious person, do the more important job he can do for both himself and the society is his duty.
If you find out that you can only do well what you do now, you can just focus more attention or energy on it later.
They think the time for one to work is short.
But other people like to change their jobs many times in their life.
They are eager to make progress in their jobs.
In a short, such people like the job more important than the salary.
My view on job hopping is the first kind.
I think work is an important part of our life.
In short, they want to live a peaceful life all the time.
They don't like to do the same thing from day to day.
They enjoy challenging themselves by the different jobs or the irregular conditions or the different people from all the countries.
During the working days, they can make friends or get much useful information which they'll helpful in the future.
I like to change jobs every year.
It's the chances that the young man need first.
I think that "grasp the chance is grasping the future.
"
There are different views on Job-Hopping.
Some people like to take only one kind of job for ever.
The first kind of man, they want a stable job.
They will be skilled in operating medicines.
They have much more experiences in their job.
Then their life is full of interest.
They always want to change their job from time to time.
My view on job-hopping is that we should often change our job.
With the development of our society.
People's ideas of job are changing day by day.
Because they are eager to know the unknown world and they want to learn more skills and they can get new ideas.
Some people enjoy doing a job in their lives.
Certainly, now many men are like them.
They think they do a job for a relatively long time.
Electing a favourable job is a difficult thing.
I will not continue working.
To find a new one is necessary.
Many people often transfer their job from this to another.
One reason is probably they have not found a job interesting,this can not hold him back.
In my opinion, to find a proper job is above all.
After basic education we often need some special training or continue our study for a special subject.
Otherwise if you couldn't settle down yourself, then you need check yourself.
So they learned some other knowledge.
At the time of work, they have more free working for job.
Some people like only one job in his life.
We can save a lot of time.
If we do one job every day, we will be fit for it better.
It is better for him if the circumstance is changed.
In general, more people like a fixed job.
I think we can grasp some knowledge in some kinds of jobs.
But when we have a job we should not change the job frequently.
Why does he act so?
Perhaps, to him, a new job can much more proves his capability, he likes changes around him.
He wants to show his adaptability and prove his value in new conditions.
To me, as being an time older, I hate the changes around me, and like to do the same job day after day.
There are many people who always like doing a kind of work.
This work brings enough money for him to live on.
First of all, they are always interested in it and they can find pleasure in it.
They are absorbed in it and can't leave it.
Many people often change their work.
If they do a job all the time they will be tired of it.
I don't like doing the same job.
Different jobs will give me different pleasure.
Some people like to do the same job for life.
They think that there are many advantages for this.
Seconld, they do the same job so that they can learn the knowledge and skill further, and achieve the achievement.
Many hard jobs will not be done.
But some of the people would change their work often only because they don't like the job or they don't get enough money from the work.
The second reason, if you can't find a good job, or you don't like you present job, you should make yourself like it, whatever you do, you should do good to people and yourself.
The last one is if you are a very good person, you may change your work until you get a very prefect one for you, then you should decide that you do your work seriously.
In all, we may change our jobs, but above all, we should consider our devotion to society.
Alter all, we do everything just for the development of the society.
They prefer to lead a quiet life.
Their interests are very wide.
However, I'm against those people who change their work only to enjoy themselves not to do it well.
Since, we find a good job, we should do it well.
This is my view on this question.
Most people have jobs.
And their jobs are in all kinds.
The second kind people haven't a job that they like, and they feel they can do noting in their jobs.
But don't change it too often, or you will do nothing in your life.
Some people think they should take only one job in their lives.
In contrast, some people like to change their jobs, according to their interest, some of them are bored with their jobs.
We know that some people always devote themselves to only one job for good, while others like job-hopping.
The new generation always holds this opinion.
Because if I always hop the job, I can't succeed in any job I've done.
When I see a ?good?job, I want to hop.
Practically, I lose the chance to succeed.
Some people want to do a fixed job.
Because if they always do a job, they can do it well and they mustn't learn something else, making efforts.
And they can get on well with each other.
And they won't think how to face the strangers and how to make friends with them.
Others want to change the job often.
They don't like to do a job for ever.
And they want to make friends with the strangers.
And they want to challenge the future.
I think, we should change the job often, so we can learn something new and know the world well.
When having some abilities, we can devote ourselves to the world well.
They like challenge.
It can let me do my best in the job.
And the wages also are very important.
Meanwhile, when they familiar with one work, they can do it better.
Some people like going in for one job.
This is the most important reason.
Other people like changing jobs.
This, they can exert their abilities.
Lastly changing jobs can learn much more experience and knowledge.
My view on job-hopping is on condition that the job is suitable for me.
We must study and live through the job, so the job is important to us.
I don't disagree with the first one.
But I like the latter better.
Some people may like to work on the same job for ever.
Maybe these people have no much know ledge and good skills.
So they are difficult to quit a kind of new job.
Maybe they have good skills and much knowledge.
Or they are young.
So they can quit many kinds of jobs.
So that I would have much and I would have much more to study more and more knowledge, and train myself many skills.
During the long time of work, they can learn how to do it and how to do best.They will be the expert in these fields.
But the other people are likely to change the jobs a lot.
They want to learn all kinds of abilities in difference jobs.
Every time they change the jobs, they will set the interest again.
The reasons have two: first they think they are interested in the job and will do the job for ever.
Second ,they may have the job is very simple, and they may have a rich life.
My view on job hopping is the first one.
A job which wants to do the best isn't a single thing.
It needs to spend much time and much spirit.
It needs to spend much time and much spirit.
Some people want to go in for a single work all along.
The reason why they want to do so is not surprising.
First of all, the same work is familiar to them so that they can do it well.
Second, some people are so conservative that they do not like to risk something else.
Because I want to do it better.
Some people like to go in for one job from the beginning till the end.
Because they like to be stable all the time.
These men like living a stable life.
They don't want to go here and there.
But some people like to go in for one job because they are to achieve great success in this field.
So they do the job without interruption.Some people like to change their jobs frequently because they want to attempt all kinds of jobs.
Then I can be fit for the society better.
Furthermore, I like to live in different circumstances.
I like new circumstances.
So I like to change my job frequently.
In their lives every day is new.
Only the job which I like, I work for it, I can face excited, and challenged.
And I would do all my best for it, until make it best.
People have views whatsoever on job-hopping.
Some of them like to take one kind of work for ever, because they have an unchanged interest and believe they will make great progress sooner or later as the result of working hard.
And I am sure that I can turn it to truth.
The life is short, when you spend much time to go on the same work, your life is dark, not beautiful of the different.
If they couldn't write good article from the different experiences.
I think two opinions of the above have some reasons.
So the people like to do the same work and they can find interest from it, but I like to go on different work, and I think I can do my best in every work.
No labours, no gains.
No one could survive without labour.
So every one needs to have a job.
Some like to do one job constantly.
They like new and fresh things.
They enjoy taking different things.
Changing or not is not the most important things.
Most of them who that the young man are allays and barrette.
Interesting is a basic factor.
What the occupation do you like to take?
and so on.
Everyone has his own view on job-hopping.
In this kind of job, it makes him have the sense of safety.Someone doesn't think so.
So he often likes to change his job.
My view on job-hopping is that I must master a kind of skill and this skill should make sure that I have a good life.
Then I will make it possible to do different jobs.
I will have more chance and I will feel safe.
They have interesting in doing the same work.
These people always like adventures.
They feel that the new job can give them new surprise.
At first, I will chance a job that I am interesting.
Then I keep studying the skill.
This will make me do the job much better than others.
If I always change my work, I will always do worse then the others.
If I do that, I will waste all my life and do nothing.
So my view on job-hopping is keep doing one job and do it best.
Or they get much money from the work.
They can't get the manger what need form the work.
So they like job-hopping.
But this is my private view.
I know the society is realities.
They do the things that they have done from beginning.
But some people often change their jobs.
I think man can have many jobs, but not to change too much.
We must spend a lot of time to do it best.
Because they have mastered how to do the job well.
In this condition, they have the stable income.
They perhaps are satisfied with the job and the life.
I also don't like to do the same job for a very long time.
For example ten years or all over my life.
This kind of men don't seem to succeed too.
Don't change your job without goal.
Everyone may have a view on working.
Usually I can do are thing from start to end until finish it .
After finishing one thing I like to take in another so I like to change work.
The topic is very popular with the people all over the world.
There are two answers to the view on job-hopping.
Some people like doing only a job all their lives.
They thought they can do better in their job because of their special experience.
But there are other people insist that changing job frequently is good to them.
Because all kinds of the job would make them know much than only one kind of job.
As far as I am concerned, I hold on the first view.
Only we take much time in the job we are doing, we can get the more.
Some people like engaging in one kind of job consistently.
It is partly influenced by the national culture.
To them, that's enough.
Whether these people like their job or not, they are sure to try their best to do everything well.
We can often see that people always serve one company in loyalty through their lives.
For instance, most Americans are the typical examples.
They hate?stationery".
In their views, changing is reasonable.
Nowadays, people should change with the world.
In the position, you're confident that you can do it much better than any other.
Of course, you should be qualified for it first.
So whether you change your job or not, is not important.
The critical thing is that you can do your work well and you're sure that it is the just work you need.
Of course, they may get more money from the work.
In order to get great achievement, they think they should challenge fate.
So we should work hard in school so that we can gain sensitive achievement in a work after graduation.
They don't want to change.
However, There are many reasons.
Second, somebody is afraid of competition.
Sometimes, it means starting again, and must spend more time.
My views of job-hopping is changing job can make me better about life, study, and work.
Some don't like to change their job.
And do kinds of job can't make them do well on jobs.
So they like to change jobs.
In one's life, changing jobs can make life more wonderful and interesting.
Nowadays, people have different attitude to the job-hopping.
Why do they stand for their view?
There are all kinds of people in the world, and everyone has his own view about job-hopping.
I hope all people can fined their own job which they like!
Why?
From the work, they can gain much fun.
From new work we can learn more knowledge.
More knowledge can make us more creative.
We mustn't change work because it's uninteresting, or tend to do one work because lazy to learn new knowledge.
All of us will succeed.
Some persons like to do only one work in their whole life.
Because the hate to change their work.
They think that when they only do one work, they can get more achievement in this work.
But if they often change it, they may get only a little achievement in any work.
But the other persons like to change they work.
But we couldn't change it too often.
Because changing the work means that we have to return to the starting -point of our work.
And it's also possible that they dislike their jobs where they work at present.
They think if they out of work, they can find another work right away.
I will like to the job what my choose.
On the other hand, there are some people like changing their jobs frequently.
They want to hunt for a more satiable job for them by job-changing.
They also want to promote their position through job-changing.
This kind of view is not correct.
But people can't often change their job because they must spend most time fitting for the new job.
These people have a purpose from their childhood that they want to be in the future.
And they always work hard towards the purpose.
However, there are also some people who like to change their careers.
Of course, there are other factors make them change their job.
After graduation I will do the job all the way about computers, because I like it.
The word?Haste makes waste?is very reasonable.
The word says that if we do every thing, we should step by step.
We know, that every thing according to it's own order.
We must obey it.
If we don't, we can do nothing.
The next day, when he saw the crops again, the crops had been dead.
"Haste makes waste" is an old saying of our country.
It contains two meanings.One is that if you want to succeed, you should firstly be patient.
The other is if you are too impatient, your goal will otherwise difficult to reach.
You may want to be a teacher in your childhood.
Can't you imagine how you will teach and how much the students will know you?
"Where there is a will, there is a success".
This is another Chinese old saying, work hard and patiently, you will get your purpose in the end.
You may usually hear people say "haste makes waste", however, do you know what it mean.
Sometimes, people must do something in very short time.
But they often forget some essential procedures.
For example, you hurry to catch on the train.
After you return for the ticket and arrive again, the train has gone off.
You want to hurry.
Because no matter what we do or will do, we must conform to the natural law.
So when we do anything, we should comply with the natural law.
?Haste makes waste ?is a common truth.
The development of anything is a process of making progress.
It is from the low to the high.
If we want to get a success., we must work hard.
But it is not enough to work hard.
We have to consider the conditions we have.
For example, long ago there was a farmer in China.
On a winter day he walked in his farm saw his wheat too small.
He felt his wheat's growth slow ,so he decided to help them by his hand.
After done this, he was happy.
But several days later, all his wheat died.
From this story, we can draw a conclusion "Haste makes waste.
"
Everyone wants to make things not only good but fast.
But if you only want to use the fastest way to do something.
Usually, you may have a neither good nor fast reward.
Because haste makes waste.
Sometimes you must spend more time doing the things.
For example, when you drive a car to attend an important meeting.
When you see the red light, you must stop you car.
Otherwise you'll have to use more time to cope with policemen.
As the same reason as our studying, we eager to reach good study and to use time fully.
?Go over will let you know new knowledge".
We won't do things the most quickly because haste makes waste.
?Haste Makes waste?
mainly means that someone eager to get something but can't reach it in the end.
Why?
And each of them can't be avoided.
For example, when we study something, first we must have a general look at it.
Then through learning it we slowly understand it.
At last we waste it.
There are three stages, we shall do it in sequence.
It is impossible to reach the third stage without the first and the second stages.
We should do everything quickly and well.
Not only fast but also good.
Faster is base on understanding.
Thus we can do things successfully.
We often want to finish a work in a short time, so we can use more spare time to do other things.
But haste often makes waste.
Because we can not do every thing well in so short time.
It would need more time.
So we can read more books.
When you finish reading it and the other man asks what it says, perhaps you can say nothing.
So I think we must do everything carefully in our life and can't want do it fast than normally.
Success is tempting to everyone, and it is the fruit of one's sweat, struggle, even life.
so we couldn't obtain it easily in face of difficulties or danger.
Third we should hold scientific method, discover the access to success.
The way to success is not easy.
Before the success, we can't be anxious.
In face of danger, we must have self-confidence and devote greater efforts to it.
If he gives up halfway.
he can't achieve the success.
There is a kind of general idea to say that haste makes waste.
I think it is true.
During the courses of haste, you may forget many factors important to your work, and you have only an idea to succeed in a short time.
In fact, there are many things like that in our lives.
For example, when you study English, you wish to remember the words quickly, so you read quickly and are anxious of mastering them in a short time.
However, you get lower efficiency.
Then, you waste much time in remembering such words.
We shall think over the words, then remember them.
By means of this, we can succeed quickly.
In a word, a man shall not hurry up in working or studying.
Only after thinking over, we can go to finish the work, or haste will make waste.
But usually we can't get it as we want .
As we have a wonderful hop, and we will try our best to obtain it.
So the result is that we have to accept the defeat.
For example.
As we all know, we shouldn't do anything hurriedly or else we'll fail to do it well.
When doing a thing, we should do it step by step, while not haste to do it, if we have to do it.
It will make waste.
In our everyday life, there are many examples like this.
The possibility of passing the Band Six exam will be greater.
All in all, when we want to do anything well, we should do it from less to more.
But we can't benefit from it.
We perhaps make a plan beyond reach with it.
For example, if you eager to pass a exam you will feel frightened when you are doing it.
This you will do worse than usual.
I often have a bad habit of haste, it makes me bad records in some tests.
Why it is ?
I think that everything to be realized has a across.
If someone doesn't know this, he will make a failure.
For example, my brother was a student of one middle school.
He didn't do well in English.
He asked me to help him improve his English.
So I made a plan of English study for him.
Everyday he got up at 6 o'clock to read the English lesson.
No one can learn it well in a short time.
The consequence is not the one that he wants to obtain.
Then why does it happen?
Because when you are in hurry, you must be anxious and impatient.
I have an uncle who works in a factory.
One day he wanted to buy something in a supermarket.
The supermarket is not far from his home.
He had to wait for some time.
If he had been on foot, he would have finished shopping.
From this example, we can conclude that in some conditions, you should select the correct way to do something.
Or else you will obtain the consequence that you don't want.
We often think of such a sentence as ?as soon as possible?when we are doing something in hurry, and then make the whole thing even worse.
This is"haste makes waste".
You may forget to bring the papers with you which the professor will use in the class, and you can do nothing about it.
Another example, when you want to finish your work quickly so as to do something else, you will find a lot of mistakes in your work then.
Therefor, haste makes waste.
You may ask, why haste makes waste?
Haste is good, because it means fast to do a thing.
It can raise the product rate.
But mostly we can't do the thing well.
That's to say, haste makes waste.
Today, we always go after efficiency when we do the things.
So we do all the jobs rapidly.
It is reasonable partially, but as the old saying goes: haste makes waste.
We should do it from the beginning or step by step, finally to the end.
For examples, when I was in high school, I was afraid to do mathematics exercise.
I always tried doing it quickly, but however anxious I was, I couldn't solve it smoothly.
You can do the exercise.
I did so, and the result was good.
So we would remember the old saying: haste makes waste.
It is right.
But why they say?Haste Makes Waste?.
I think if we do a thing, we must do it step by step.
For example: if we study English.
Firstly we must study English from A, B, C. Secondly, we study words, sentences, grammar and so on.
Thirdly, we can read, write, listen and speak.
We won't be able to study English well.
We must study English step by step.
At last, we'll study English very well.
There is a well-known saying: Haste makes waste.
But why?
There are two aspects in a process: quality and speed.
If we put too much our energy and too many resources on the speed, quality must be ignored.
Then as a result, we can't get a good result.
We have a good example in the economic history of our country to illustrate what is said above.
So our economy didn't develop as expected.
But many complaints were got by the authorities.
So whatever we do, we should work to get not only the speed but also the quality.
Do you know why?
I think it refers to the plan and action's process.
It is a truth as we all know.
So I think ?Haste makes waste?.
If we want to succeed, we should learn step by step.
You may ask why.
You know I am a student.
I want to get a good record.
Once I stayed at classroom for long time a day.
I studied without necessary rest.
I went to bed so late.
Because I wanted to be a "good" student.
But in the end of the term, I always feel headache and other sick feelings too.
Of course my study didn't improve.
Through this fact, I know I couldn't haste, I must study gradually and prepare the course exactly.
Please remember it when you do everything.
How to do a thing well?
After we mastered it completely, then we can do it perfectly.
Every one of us wants to do the things rapidly and orderly.
What does cause the phenomena high on earth?
There are several reasons as follow: first, the speed may influence the efficiency.
We usually make the things only in speedy manner not in quality manner.
The result often is what we don't want when we merely do the things rapidly.
Second, the feeling of doing the things may influence the result.
When we want to finish a duty in quick manner, the mind is often nervous and cautious.
So the result is often bad.
When we do our house work, we often do worse than ever because of wanting a high speed.
Generally, the quality is first important and the speed is second.
He read the book of accounting day and night in a month.
But he hasn't pass the examination.
What is the reason?
Because the knowledge of accounting is complex.
So he couldn't pass the examination.
Otherwise you will not succeed.
Every person knows that time is invaluable, so some people are always in a hurry.
But, on the other hand, every one must know haste makes waste.
When you do things in a hurry, you will find that time is always not enough.
When the rate of success is low, because you will forget many facts of act, or take something by mistake.
For an example, you are having a test, and you want to finish the test ahead of time.
So you have to write quickly.
At the same time you will find your handwriting is very poor.
Now, you can see haste makes waste.
If you want to do something in a hurry, you must feel anxious.
When a man hastes to do the work, he always can't finish it successfully.
One day, my mother asked me to help her to lift the water away home.
She let me lift less than her.
At that time, I was still young, but I want to finish the task in no time.
Why do we say "Haste makes waste"?
We should operate it according to its steps.
For example.
If you want to learn English.
First, you should be able to read so and so, and then, you ought to learn words, based on which, you will understand a long report written with English.
Chinese often say: ?haste makes waste?.
If you determine to do something well, you should do it step by step.
Finally, you'll not succeed in doing it.
For example, five years ago my classmates and I decided to climb the mountain near our school.
Then we all ran fast, but soon we tired.
So I thought some of the questions could not ask.
If I wrote down the questions I thought it had, I could get to pass it and get a high score.
But, finally, I had only a score of 65 in the exam.
In a word, you should not do anything faster than you can.
You should do everything step by step.
In Chinese, there is an idiom-haste makes waste.
But it is too difficulty to realize.
Because the development of everything has its own sequence and we can't break it.
Additionally, the ability is limited.
They will be the direct obstacles on our way to the goal.
We know that the ?quantity?doesn't mean the same as the ?quality?.
Though I'm not very good at it.
I think no one could be at the same level as me in three days.
But I failed.
The use of words is complicated.
My ability of memorization is limited.
I'm not a superman.
And the new words made me more puzzled.
So I think haste makes waste.
Many people believe that haste makes waste.
As we know, this idea is much well conductive thought to do anything.
For example, learning English is usually done by the sequence of listening, speaking, reading, writing.
It is only a dream for you to run without doing the excesses of walking.
It can be hurry to eat the heating?Dou Fu?, or it will injure your mouth.
So we say that haste makes waste.
The achievements are created by depending on hard working by steps.
Only if we do things act on the steady steps, we are successful men.
It is well known that ?Haste Makes Waste ".
It means that you will not succeed if you do things in a hurry.
As we all know, we must spend much energy and time if we want to do something well.
There is no difficult things in the world.
With the patience and time goes on,we can succeed.
If we want to grasp the meaning of the texts, we must read it again and again, till we can understand it entirely.
Another example is that before we step into the society, we must put all the energy on studying other than finding a job in a hurry.
If you make a great success in your studying, it is no difficult to find your position in society.
So we can say,?Haste Makes Waste?.
final exam.
I was afraid I couldn't finish the paper, so when the exam began, I tried my best to hurry up.
Finally, I had many problems left.
final exam.
Haste makes waste.
When you begin to do something, the first you should do is to take yourself in calm.
Seen from the chart given above, the life expectancy has changed from 40 years to 60 years old in the past 30 years.
That is, people live longer in 1990s than in the past 30 years.
For one thing, the developing countries are richer and stronger than before.
So the people's living conditions are better than before.
With the development of the society, health gains have been changed a lot.
First we see the life expectancy.
In 1960 the average life was 40 years old, while in 1990 the average life was 60 years old.
Secondly, the infant mortality in 1960 is 20 percent, but it is only 10 percent in 1990.
First because of the improvement of the level of the people's life.
All kinds of food are supplied.
There are other reasons if you want to find out.
The people of developing countries are becoming more and more healthy.
According to the statistics, the life expectancy of the people has increased from 1960's 40 years old to 1990's 60 years old in developing countries.
In 1960, it was 200 deaths per 1000 births, however, it had dropped to 100, in 1990.
There are many reasons for the health gains in developing countries.
First, the agricultural and industrial development provides more nutritious food which builds the body of the people in developing countries.
Second, the medical cause has also improved, which helps to protect the people from many diseases.
Third, the people of developing countries have been aware of the importance of physical training and more and more of them become active in it.
There are also many other reasons accounting for health gains.
Great changes have taken place in the developing countries since the second world war.
The standard of living has increased.
Firstly, people's living standard in developing countries had improved a lot, as the result of that people pay more attention to their health.
For instance, life expectancy was forty years old in 1960, nevertheless, was sixty years old in 1990, its range was from fifty to sixty.
Its range was from 200 to 100.
They were caused by several reasons.
The above chart is about the changes of life expectancy and infant mortality, which happened in developing countries.
From it we can learn that health gains in developing countries are very great.
In 1990, it reduced to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why did the changes take place?
They no longer suffered from coldness and starvation.
Second, the medical care was better than before.
When people got ill, they would get the best care or treatment.
Third, owing to the development of medicine, more and more diseases could be overcome.
Infant mortality decreased sharply.
For example, in developing countries, the life expectancy in 1960 was about 40 years old, yet in 1990 it has increased to 80 years old.
What has caused the changes?
Now most people of these countries can get enough food to eat and even live comfortably.
After World War II, ??
?peace and development?????
The life expectancy was about 40 years old in 1960, thirty years later, it increased to about 60 years old.
People began to know how to develop good habits and prevent themselves from diseases.
In 1960, the life expectancy is only 40 years old, but in 1990, It has risen to 60 years old, on the contrary, the infant mortality has declined from 25%0 to 100%0.
Why does this happen.
For example, in developing countries the life expectancy is forty years in 1960 but is sixty years in 1990.
Why is the development?
In a word, with the society developing, the developing countries will gain much more improvement of health.
In recent years the health gains in developing countries have dramatically improved.
For example, the life expectancy in these countries in 1960 was 40, and it was 60 in 1990.
In 1960, about 200 out of 1000 infants died when they were born, in 1990, the figure is 100 out of 1000.
Why have these changes taken place?
First, with the development of their economy, people's living conditions have improved greatly.
They have spent more and more money on building modernized hospitals and clinics so that people can receive better treatment when they are ill.
In most developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality are different at different times.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy is about 40 and the infant mortality is nearly 20%.
However, in 1990, the things are changed: the life expectancy increased, but the infant mortality decreased.
But there is something in common.
First, with the development of science, the people's living standard is increasing.
The days when they have to fill their stomachs with anything available are gone.
People have more money to better their living conditions.
Third, many new foods which can benefit people's body are invented.
Perhaps this: with the development of the society, people's living condition is improved highly, the medical treatment is improved rapidly.
More and more people pay attention to their health.
They have enough time and money to adjust their diet, the arrangement of nutrition is reasonable.
According to the chart, we can see that in developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality have changed from 1960 to 1990.
The life expectancy has increased from 40 years old to 60 years old while the infant mortality has decreased from 200 to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
I think there are two reasons for that.
What causes this change?
I think there are two important reasons.
One is that the living level in the developing countries is rising.
It has increased about 20 years old in thirty years.
At the same time, the infant mortality has decreased.
Nowadays, people's life is longer than in the past in developing countries.
What caused the changes?
First, people's living conditions had become better and they could get more food such as meat, milk etc.
Second, people could also get better medical care so that they could survive many diseases.
That is 100 deaths of 1000 births.
What courses the great change?
In addition, chemical technology is developing quickly.
Since 1960, in many developing countries there have been great changes in life expectancy and infant mortality.
What caused these great changes?
I think there are several reasons as follows.
Firstly.
Not only economy but also everything have developed greatly.
The people's living conditions have improved a lot.
Secondly.
At that time they couldn't develop their economy.
But now the world is very peaceful, they can develop their economy, build their countries.
They often had not enough food to eat.
They lived a bad life.
But in 1990, with developing technology, they had enough food.
They lived a happy life.
All these reasons led to the changes.
The following is the reasons that cause the variation.
When a person feels ill, he can go to a hospital and have a check.
As for an infant, before giving birth to it, its mother is checked, when it is born, it was injected.
In this way it can avoid being ill.
The last reason is that people have more time than ever.
If a mother is healthy, her baby is probably healthy too.
As creatures, people have their lives, from birth to death.
Why?
The people of developing countries are now all healthy, and live a good life.
The health condition has been developed since 1960, especially in the developing countries.
After 30 years, the life expectancy had increased to 60 years old.
In 1960, it was 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
How the changes took place?
How the health condition of the developing countries are increasing.
we believe that more health gains will be made in the future.
This is a chart about the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
The above fact is brought about by different factors.
For one thing, it is related to the progress of science and to the increase of the people's living standards.
Their food is mainly from wild plants and animals.
Now, people have some time to exercise and know the importance of good health.
The highest life expectancy is 40 years old.
First, the economic development results in the changes.
Firstly the life expectancy in 1960 is 40 years old.
But in 1990 it becomes 60 years old.
In 1960, there were 250 deaths per 1,000 births.
Second, because of the improvement of people's living condition people can often eat meat, milk, eggs etc.
These foods will do good to people's health very much.
Third, world peace makes people work and live freely and comfortably.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy in developing country is 40 years old.
At the same time, the infant mortality of developing country is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
The latter was nearly three times compared to the former.
Third, people's conception varied.
This one is the main reason.
Certainly there are some other reasons that cause the result.
The cause of the changes mainly consists in the economic development of these countries.
First, the medical standard was increasing.
In developing countries, before 1960, the medical ability is poor.
Second, the living standard was increasing in developing countries.
Before 1960, people could not find enough things to eat.
We have enough money to improve our living standard and go to see the doctor.
The second reason is that the medical level is increased too, many illness that could not be cured before can be treated well now.
In 1960, the life expectancy is forty.
But in 1990, it increased to sixty.
Although in 1990, it cuts down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What are the reasons for these changes?
Firstly, the economic development is the most important reason.
Thirdly the excellent social conditions is a reason.
The statistic data above can show the change to you.
While in 1990, it is about 60 years old.
In 1960 the infant mortality is 200 deaths per 1,000 births, while in 1990, it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Perhaps you may ask what's the reason.
The standards of life are improving.
People have a strong body.
More and more hospitals are being put up.
What's more, they began to own modern medical facilities, whenever a child or adult gets sick, he will receive an immediate attention.
I think it is the reason.
As for life expectancy, in 1960 it was forty years old.
However, in 1990, they lived on milk, eggs, more vegetable and fruits and so on.
Second, it is the good medicine and conditions in hospital.
In 1960, the woman usually had baby at home where there is no doctor or nurse.
They could only depend on themselves.
In 1960, life expectance was 40 years old while in 1990, it reached 60 years old.
The infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1000 births and average life expectancy is only forty.
Many people needn't worry about their foods and clothes.
The development has raised life expectancy too.
For the graph we can see the change of life expectancy and infant mortality of developing countries.
The change is encouraging.
The reasons of the change lie in three main aspects.
Firstly: from 1960s, more developing countries were liberated, there was no cruel rule .
It's not very distinctive in developed countries, but in the developing countries, it is quite different.
Since many countries carry out the economic reforms, the people's living standards are higher and higher.
In the past thirty years, the life expectancy and the infant mortality in developing countries have changed much.
They could have more high quality food, such as meat, eggs, milk, fish etc.
The life expectancy in the developing countries rises from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990, while the infant mortality reduces from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 in 1990.
They begin to pay attention to nutrition, health, etc.
The problem of feeding babies becomes important to poor young parents.
We can see the great changes of the life expectancy and the infant mortality in developing countries.
The third reason is the medical condition got better and better.
First, the steady development of society is the main reason.
In short with the development of society people will be alive longer and infant mortality will be down.
The people's living standard has been increased, and the health conditions also become better.
Secondly, many international organizations offered developing countries great help.
In 1960, the life expectancy in developing countries was 40 years old, but in 1990, the life expectancy had increased by 50 percent, being 80 years old.
The health service improved.
Based on above reasons, life expectancy increased and infant mortality reduced from 1960 to 1990.
With the development of science, this tendency will continue.
So it has a great increase.
So we can see it has a great decrease.
There are three reasons why so great change has happened.
Second, the condition of medicine is much better.
First, life expectancy has increased.
In 1960, it was only 40 years old that people could live.
There are many reasons.
So great changes appear in the developing countries.
What's the reason that caused this change?
The life expectancy increased from 1960 to 1990.
At the same time, the infant mortality declined.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births.
The reason why the health gains changed so much because the living standard increased and the government paid more attention to people's health.
Great changes of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries have taken place in the last 30 years from 1960 to 1990.
Life expectancy had changed from 40 years old to 80 years old.
And the infant mortality had fallen from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Health gains in developing countries have great changes.
However, nowadays, developing countries have been developing at high speed.
The industry and agriculture also have enough products for the people to consume.
Therefore, as a developing country, our country should accelerate development so that our lives can be improved quickly.
But, in the same thirty years, the infant mortality descended from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
There were such reasons.
From the data we could find some changes about the life expectancy and infant mortality of developing countries.
But it has increased to 60 by 1990.
Secondly, the infant mortality of developing countries is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
But is has decreased to 100 by 1990.
I think there are some reasons of the changes.
People realized its seriousness.
Such as TV, radio program.
They achieved great improvement.
In the past thirty years.
Life expectancy in 1990 is higher than that in 1960.
In 1960 the life expectancy is 40 years old but in 1990 it is 80 years old.
Differing from life expectancy, infant mortality in 1960 is higher than that in 1990.
In 1990 it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births, but in 1960 it is higher.
They can eat better and receive much better medical service.
In developing countries, on the average, people's life expectancy averaged 40 years old in 1960, while in 1990 people's life expectancy rapidly increases by 50 years old.
There are some reasons for the changes.
From the developing population of China.
The life expectancy has increased from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
Meanwhile, the infant mortality has decreased from 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 to 100 in 1990.
The main reason is the development in medicine and some other sciences and the development of the technology.
Why has this change taken place?
First, people's level of living has increased.
And we believe that more great changes will take place and our lives will be more and more beautiful.
The other cause is the policy in such countries.
There are all kinds of causes which to cause the change.
Let's see the first picture: In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old, however, it is 60 years old in 1990 .There is 20 years older than 1960's.
Why?
The first reason -- With the development of the medicine, people's health is improved.
The important reason is that the medicine developed very much.
In 1960, life expectancy is 40 years old.
In 1990, life expectancy is 60 years old.
In 1990, it is 10 percent.
From the truth we can draw a conclusion that the developing countries have made rapid progress in man's health.
Now let us find the reasons.
First, also the most important, maybe in recent years, developing countries have gained independence, and have made rapid progress in national industries etc.
People of the countries are also concentrating on good and healthy food.
Birth control is our country's policy.
Now, with the development of every country, more and more people will realize the health problem.
The first reason is that medical level is improving in developing countries.
People can have a good medical condition.
when people are sick.
Another reason is people's life level is improving in developing countries.
In 1960, the life expectancy in 40 years old while in 1990, the life expectancy is 60 years old.
Second, the medical conditions are improved.
These make the country develop quickly.
From the chart we can see the following fact.
What's the reason?
With the economic development, the medical care is developed too.
These are the very reasons.
In 1960, the condition of the developing countries was poor, as well as that of the world.
The life expectancy of the developing countries was 40 years old on average and the infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
The life expectancy reached 60 years old in 1990, and the infant mortality reached 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The developments of production, medical service and the techniques, all had contributed to the former changes.
Great changes have taken place in developing countries about the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
In 1960, the life expectancy was very low.
Nobody could live over 60 years old.
The life expectancy was 40 years old and or so.
But the infant mortality was very high.
The infant mortality was about 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
The average of the life expectancy was about 60 years old.
And the infant mortality decreased.
It was about no more than 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
So great changes have taken place.
On the other hand, the infant mortality has decreased by 50 percent within the same period.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but only 100 in 1990.
Why has these changes taken place in the developing counties.
There are some reasons.
Firstly the governments of the developing counties applied themselves to developing their national economy and produced a lot of food.
People become more healthy than before in many aspects.
A good point of case is that life expectancy and infant mortality have prominent change in developing countries.
The same as infant mortality in China.
Compared with 200 per 1000 births in 1960 the number of the deaths only was 100 in 1990.
Why happened these changes?
These affected life expectancy and infant mortality greatly.
Life expectancy was 40 years in 1960, while it was 60 years in 1990, while it was 60 years in 1990.
The most important reason which caused these changes was the development of economy in developing countries.
This made people richer, the living conditions of people had improved greatly .
We hope that much more progress will be made!
From the chart.
There are many reasons for the phenomenon.
In a word.
The life expectancy in developing countries was forty years old or so in 1960, but it reached sixty years old in 1990.
The infant mortality in developing countries was about two hundred deaths per 1,000 births, however, it decreased to about one hundred deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 .
It is one-second of that of 1960.
The people in developing countries worked hard to raise their living standard in the past years.
They made great achievements.
They must work harder and their living standard will be better in the future.
First, the life expectancy in developing countries has greatly changed, it has risen by twenty years for an average person since 1960 when it was 40 .
Then, what are the reasons of such changes?
First products have been produced.
Then people's life in developing countries is much better than before, as a result people will live longer than before and infant mortality is sure to decline.
Second, most countries in the world call for peace such as China.
The world as a whole is peaceful.
So, the result is not strange.
As we can see from the given figure.
In 1960, life expectancy at most reaches 40 and in 1990, it reaches sixty.
What caused the changes in developing countries?
So, people have benefited from it and increase their nutrition.
With the development of the technology and science in developing countries, the living conditions and living levels of the people are improved greatly.
Now, with the rising level of people's lives, they have more and more money to buy expensive, nutritious food, then become more and more strong .
From the chart given above, we can see that there are obvious changes that take place in life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
What caused this to happen?
Second, Governments pay more attention to people's health.
More and more people are concerning about their life expectancy and the next generation.
In 1960, the life expectancy of developing countries was only 40 years old.
Contrary to the life expectancy, the infant mortality decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 in 1990.
What on earth causes these changes?
The other cause is the change of medical condition.
What causes the changes?
So many people can buy good, food such as meat, fish, eggs, chickens.
In a word, the government and people all attach importance to the health.
Health in developing countries has been greatly increased from 1960 to 1990.
Life expectancy in developing countries is about 40 years old in 1960 while in 1990 is about 60 years old.
What caused these changes?
First, most developing countries have been developing their economy.
Their economy has been improved.
Second, people begin to care about their life.
They have enough money to improve their living condition and food quality.
They often took part in sports in their spare time.
The last one, the medical cause has been changed better than ever.
The medical technology is modern.
From these facts we can draw a conclusion that the life expectancy has become longer than ever while the infant mortality has decreased.
What caused this change?
First, life conditions were improved greatly.
Second medical conditions were improved too, many illnesses have been cured .
In a word, health gains in developing countries.
On the other hand, infant mortality of developing countries is decreasing.
It has fallen from 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 to 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
Therefore, health in developing countries has improved greatly.
This may be due to the two main facts.
First, the life of people in developing countries was better than before.
Most of them had enough to eat.
They had better and more medicines and more precise medical instruments.
Of course, there were many other causes, but the two points above were the most important ones.
People will live longer and the death, of infants will be less.
In developing countries, the life expectancy and infant mortality have changed a lot.
Based the chart has been given, we may know the following information.
From 1960 to 1990, the infant mortality is also different.
This is why?
In the 1960s, the developing countries are very poor.
With the development of these countries.
Firstly, the economy in developing countries has developed, which betters the people's life and makes them gain better life conditions than before.
In 1960, life expectancy was 40 and infant mortality was about twenty percent.
However, in 1990, life expectancy increased to 60, while infant mortality decreased to ten percent.
The vital reason is developing economy.
With the developing economy, medicine is developing.
And people's living condition has made progress.
Now, people had enough food and better medical condition.
We can get the information from the picture, in 1960 the life expectancy is only forty years old, while in 1990, it is sixty years old .
The most important reason is the development of technology.
The second reason is the development of medicine, this makes our body health .
Fox example, during the thirty years from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy has raised 20 years.
On the other hand, infant mortality has declined.
As the graph showed, 200 deaths per 1000 births in the year 1960, but till the year 1990, infant mortality has reduced to 100.
What may account for the change of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries?
In my opinion, this change is largely due to the development of developing countries economy.
With the development of economy, the people own more money and thus they may improve their life quality.
As a result, the people of these countries have enhanced the living level.
Secondly, the medical infrastructure has get more efficient.
From the two graphs we can learn, the life expectancy of the developing countries increased from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
I think that the reason why health gains in developing countries developed quickly is various.
First, the development of medicine is the most important factor.
Second, the improvement of people's living standards is a factor as well.
With the development of the economy, more and more people pay their attentions to health.
There are several reasons for this.
First of all, the population in the world increases rapidly.
Human beings demand more and more from the globe, especially the water, which is essential to life.
Secondly, every country tries its best to develop its industry as quickly as possible.
So more water is needed.
enough for us to use.
In their opinion, we can get fresh water from rain, river, lake, under the ground etc.
But in fact, we are very short of fresh water.
First, with the increase of populations, people's need and use of fresh water has risen quickly.
Finally, water pollution becomes much more serious than ever.
From this, we can see the global shortage of fresh water.
Firstly, we should settle the problem of water pollution.
People think that fresh water will never be used up.
We can't live without water.
We can get fresh water almost from everywhere.
People in the countryside get fresh water from wells, from rivers, from small streams and so on.
As if whenever we open the water tap, we will get fresh water.
But the reality isn't so grateful.
In fact, we are very short of fresh water.
As we know the population of the world is more than five billion.
It's much more than before and it will develop quickly and continuously.
But the fresh water is limited.
What shall we do then?
Second, all of use shouldn't waste water.
In fact, our fresh water is very limited.
Fresh water only take up about 2% of water source.
With the development of industry, lots of fresh water is used in it.
Then what should we do about it?
For a long time, people have been thinking that fresh water can't be used up.
There are a lot of rivers and lakes on our planet.
And we can get plenty of water when it rains or snows.
Most of us will never worry about the shortage of fresh water.
In fact, we have the problem of global shortage of fresh water.
The world's population is increasing sharply, and many cities are short of drinking water.
Water is also needed in industry.
With the development of industry, water, which is the most important factor in production, is becoming more and more scarce.
However, some people are still polluting fresh water.
What shall we do to solve the problem?
First, we must make everyone know the importance of fresh water, then the global shortage of it.
It's our duty to use water economically, to prevent it from being polluted.
I think, we must save the source of fresh water for ourselves and our children from now on.
Many people my think that water can't be used up.
Therefore, they may believe that it is unnecessary for us to worry about the shortage of fresh water.
First, with the increasing population, fresh water which people use increases at the same time.
Finally, owing to serious pollution, much water can't be used.
Then how should we deal with it?
I think many measures should be taken to deal with the shortage of fresh water.
On the other hand, we should take measures to make the dirty water clean and we can use it again.
They think that the fresh water can not be used up.
For instance, fresh water from the rain, the streams and the wells as well.
Fresh water is here and there.
The amount of human beings increases quickly.
All of these lead to global shortage of fresh water.
What can we do in this situation?
We must try our best to use the fresh water economically.
Many people think that fresh water can't be used up.
And in many places, it rains a lot.
In many cities, water is supplied any time if wanted on a very low price.
It seems we have too much water to use it up.
In fact, there is a serious shortage of fresh water in the world.
The water consumption increases rapidly because of the progress of population and the development of industries.
Facing such a situation, many countries have brought out many steps to control the water consumption and the water pollution.
And more and more people begin to realize the importance of saving water.
Fresh waster comes from rain, river, and so on.
Now what should we do?
Because they think that there are many rivers in our world.
Whether the fact is what they think so?
Today, fresh water is needed in many places.
So what can we do to solve the problem?
"Haste makes waste" is an old saying of China.
If someone seeks the speed when he is doing something, he (she) usually pay no attention to everything around him that can affect what he is doing.
Furthermore, he (she) can not concentrate on doing the things and make a mess of his project.
That is, he (she) wastes time doing everything for he (she) seeks for haste.

All the reasons will cause failure.
So, in doing everything, we should not only chase quickness.
Compared with time, the quality is more important to some extent.
One of the old sayings says: "Haste makes waste.
" There are two reasons for it.
First, things must be done step by step.
If you're in a hurry, you'll probably skip some step which seems unimportant but are actually essential.
As a result, you will fail eventually when you ignore some necessary steps or do something wrong.
Almost everyone has such experience.
For example, A housewife will often forget to light a fire before cooking when she wants to prepare a meal in a short time.
Or she will probably add some sugar into the dishes instead of salt.

Why does haste make waste?
There are several reasons.
That is, we must carry out the procedure step by step.

I omitted some steps which I considered "not important".
The result turned out to be a bad one.
I made a mess of my experiment and had to do it once more.
At the same time, I missed the party.
So, we can draw a conclusion that haste can cause failure and fault.
If we want to save our time, then, don't do things in a hurry.
Follow the right way and you can get the best results.
Many people believe this because they have experienced so much.
So much failures have told them that "haste makes waste.
Second, we may neglect some important things.

But why?
Because when you are in a hurry, you may do without consideration, and you are likely to act against the principles.
For example, in the ancient China, a farmer was anxious with his crops.
Why don't they grow faster, in such a sunny day?
I should work out a method to help them, he thought.
But how?
At last, he got an idea.
Then he went to the field, pulled the crops to a satisfactory height, and returned home to wait for the harvest.
And you can imagine what he ended up in at last.
This story is famous almost all over China.
It may warn us that haste makes waste when we tend to do something without caution.
Haste makes waste, is an old Chinese saying.
It means if you hurry to do something, you will often fail to get to the desired goal.
First, when you are in a hurry, you can't get every thing ready before you begin the job.
So you'll find something necessary has been forgotten when you are doing the job.
And you have to return to the beginning.
When you met with something unexpected, you won't deal with it with a patient heart.
There are many examples that can prove the saying.
The following is a simple one.

Two young people were cutting wood in the mountain.
There are many examples that we can see every moment in our lives.
Because there are always many details which he didn't pay attention to.
That makes him lose his scores.
Another example, is, when we plant a flower, we must water it once or twice a day and place it in the sunshine occasionally, but we can't water it again and again in one day to hope it flower faster, which must kill it in the end.
And we must think carefully about the problems that probably occur and the details that may be ignored before we set out to do a work.
If we don't predict the difficulty we may face, when we face it, we must be puzzled and can't find the way to solve it promptly, then we will fail.
Furthermore, if we don't consider the essential preparation, when we do the business halfway, we should go back and make up it, then we waste time and can't finish the business on time.

Everything happens according to their own regulation.

Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that haste makes waste.
Most people can't keep calm before emergency.
When there is not enough time left, he(she) may lose temper or feel uncomfortable.
Finally, everything seems to be out of order.
Once a building caught in fire.
Everybody in it rushed down the stairs and run to the only gate.
There are so many examples in our every day life.

The food had already turned bad.

Haste means that you make decisions blindly and take action rashly.
Since considered decision is not involved in the whole process of dealing with problems, the result will not be a perfect one.
Furthermore, haste makes disaster sometimes.
We are very familiar to the situation that the students who are idling away their time daily cram for an examination.
Such students fail to plan their time carefully, in other words, they fail to make a considered decision on how to use their time daily.
Here we see haste make wastes.
Then comes the conclusion that haste really makes waste.
Haste can waste your belongings and even your reputation and life.

Many people believe that haste makes waste.
Why?
We all know that any thing has its own developing principle.
Ignoring it, doing the thing according to our own expectation, lead us to failure.
I still remember the story that we learned in the primary school.
Can you see, haste makes waste.
" Step by step, you'll succeed in everything.
Why do we say so?
The saying implies the relationship between speed and efficiency.
In order to do things better, we must consider not only speed but also efficiency, otherwise, our efforts ends in vain.
I understood the meaning in an unforgettable way.
It was a high school English exam.
The reading comprehension was very difficult because of many new words.
They were so troublesome that I didn't bother to guess or deduce their meanings.
So I skimmed the passage.
But after reading it several times.
I still had no idea about the passage.
As to the other three passages, it was the same situation.
When the exam time was due, I had to guess the answers of course.
I failed in the exam.
From the experience, I learn my lesson.
That is to do things rapidly and efficiently.
People usually want to achieve their aim quickly but neglect the situation.
Situation has its regulation, we can't change it, we can't neglect it.
We must obey it and use it.
So we read, we write, we listen, we speak.
Every day we repeat them.
That's why?
We neglected the regulation in English study.
We want the speed only lose the speed.
That's "Haste makes waste".
"Haste Makes Waste" is one of the most often spoken idioms.
But not all things need only speed.
To master knowledge well, we must practise step by step.
Learning English is a good example.
And all things can't be finished in a short time.
Why do we say that?

I did so.
In a word, haste makes waste.
" Why?
Second, when he does something rapidly he does it without thinking and is careless in doing it.
But he often fails.
The seller asked him to bring them back twice because they broke easily.
He laid the pieces of glass after his bike.
As a result on his way home, the glass fell down and broke to pieces.
My friend is also a man like that.
Otherwise, we can't do it well.
Generally, people want to reach his object as fast as possible.
That is "haste makes waste".
"Haste makes waste.
" That's a famous Chinese saying.
Its means, that we should do everything step by step and with the correct method, otherwise, we'll labor in vain.
Go down the street and look for the place?
No, we should stay at some place for a while and study a map carefully, then, decide, where we should go.
In this way, we can get to our destination more quickly.
There, a house is on fire.
On seeing the smoke you rush towards it.

Why haste makes waste?
Secondly, when people work quickly they are likely to make more mistakes and perhaps some mistakes can not be corrected.
All these will take up much time.
For instance, suggest that you have only a little time to go to work.
Then you drive very fast to your office and sit down on your table.
When you begin to work you find your files are left at home.
It will take you more time to solve the problem.
Don't you want to finish your work more quickly?
Don't you want to be successful more quickly?
Yes, we do.
We all want to be good at English.
But if you don't know enough words, you won't be successful.
You can't study English well in a few days.
You must study it step by step, and you must speak and study English a lot.
Haste is harmful to us.
As the saying is "haste makes waste".
That is a great obstacle to our success.
You can't wish to do it in one day.
We should remember that haste makes waste.
In order to complete some work on time and even in advance, we often do it as quickly as we can.
But why we always say haste makes waste?
Because sometimes we do something so quickly that we couldn't take care of them.
If we are careless, we'll do something wrong.
I remember a thing that happened when I was ten years old.
Ten minutes later I came back because I left my pencil.
But Ten minutes later I came back again because I left my rubber.
When I hurried to the school, the bell rang and the examination had begun.
Why haste makes waste?
But to answer it correctly is not too easy.
When we are too eager to do one thing, more eager we are, less careful we will be.
When studying English, a lot of students will make the same mistake.
They study English day by day, year by year, and never give it up.
From the example.
Everything could be done in certain position.
Usually it leads to failure.
What you want can not be reached.
"
What would you do?
Could you get home directly?
There is a traffic jam everywhere, you can not get home quickly also.

So we do everything must accumulate, not to haste, so we can do the thing well.
Haste makes waste now I really knew.
There is a famous Chinese saying "Haste makes waste.
" Some people are always trying to do things in a hasty way in order to save time.
But in fact, they often have to spend more time.
Firstly, those people set out doing things without a plan.
Thus they don't know what important task should be finished at the beginning.
Secondly, they are anxious to save time, without a plan, so they can't get along step by step.
Furthermore, the result of their work won't be fine in such a hasty way.
For instance, when the Chinese teacher asks students to write a composition, many students begin writing without a plan.
Obviously, those students want to write an article quickly.
If they make out a plan beforehand, they can have a clear thought.
After they start to write they are able to finish the composition quickly.
" Start with a good schedule.
We can usually hear the news like this.

Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Province ( o1/4?Y?
) (School Code:2301) Jan. 97 CET-6 Composition SamplesTitle: Haste Makes Waste
Although we can offer many instances that haste saves time or sometimes even saves us from failure, haste usually spoils things in the real life.
Otherwise sometimes the results will be bad or even terrible.
But the consequence is a nightmare.
After the overthrowing of the 'Gang of Four', our government understands that haste can only make waste.
1 in the world.
It is more than a truth that haste makes waste.
It sounds reasonable.
More people win the success always make their efforts to do things .
They work hard step by step.
Sometimes, they get the success by accident, good luck.
But most of them get it by hard working.
It is easy to know its meaning.
But you have to understand its real meaning.
As we know, it is impossible for us to reach our aims without any effort.
Everyone has his own ideal, everyone wants to get to his aim as early as possible.
Everyone knows "Rome can't be built in one day.
" So can imagine he can be successful without any effort.

Of course, you couldn't get a good mark.
>From above, we can conclude that haste makes waste.
It's too short for me.
Because people can't control their mind .
For example, several days ago, one of my classmates left for his hometown ------ Zhejiang.
But he didn't make sure whether there has train from Shanghai to Zhejiang .
So we can learn from many other examples.
Make everything arranged.
Because grains can't become mature in a day.
Secondly, you begin to speak English by yourself.
Then you learn to read and write in English.
If you want to learn English in a short time, you will find everything in vain.
Everything in the world is developing gradually.
We must comply with nature's rule to gain the success.
Otherwise we can't finish anything.
Things might get to the bad side unreasonably.
Then lead things to an opposite way .
Take an example of children education here.
Many parents nowadays hope their children to be outstanding in the future.
All of these may do good in some ways, but children have normal education in school already, they have had enough exercises to do from their school teachers.
Meanwhile, They need time to play, to enjoy the nature, to make friends, to grow up as a social being ( ?"?).
A bookworm, instead of a successful person .

If they, as some people describe, stay in the "ivory tower" all the time and pay to the world outside, how could people expect them to contribute a lot to the society?
In the first place, newspapers are available all around the campus, with which students can keep pace with what is happening home and abroad.
Lastly, students can also take part-time jobs.
The first way would choose to know the outside world is to keep reading newspapers every day .
Taking part-time jobs is another way I prefer, for it could provide me with concrete sense of the outside world.
Society is another school.
How do we can get to know the world outside the campus?
I decide: I will look for a job, then I will try my best to serve the society.
This is my plan to get to know the world outside the campus.
When you go out of the campus, face this world, please think: "which typical person you want to become.
Certainly, it's only looking and listening, we can know the world from practising.
In order to work successfully in future, they do so.
As a college student, I also want to know the world outside the campus.
I will read the newspaper, and listen to the radio to know the society.
Thus we can learn enough from society, gain much experience and get ready for going into society in future.
I think it will be useful in the future.
First, they will face the world when they go out of colleges, so they must know the world.
How to know the world?
As a college student, I will face the world soon.
Some skills.
We can do it in any way.
You can through the newspaper.
I think most of us can not answer this question.
Why?
Today, getting to know the world outside the campus is an important thing for the student in the university.
There are a lot of ways to getting to know the world outside the campus.
Or you can do some work in the world outside the campus.
I think, the best way to getting to know the world outside the campus is go into it.
Also study is my most important, but I will use my free time to do some working in the world outside the campus.
In this period, there are many ways to know the world outside the campus.
Pop-media, such as TV, newspaper and radio, probably is the most effective and convenient way to know the world outside the campus.
For example, you can do a part time job, have a society investigation and so on.
Of course, I will never lose the habit of watching TV news and reading newspapers.
The question is -- how?
The more we did, the more we got.
Let's step out of the campus to know the world outside, which will benefit our future.
What can we do to know the world outside the campus?
We can know the world outside the campus through many public media.
for instance, TV, newspaper, radio ...
The TV screen is full of such bloody scenes.
All of those are due to one word: HATRED.
We can hardly find hatred in other kinds of animals.
Only human beings is cannibalistic genus.
The hatred between two families can last for tens of dozens of years and lead to murder.
The hatred between two nations lasting hundreds of years can bring wars.
We can say that the history of civilization is also the history of hatred.
We have sound reason to say that perdition of human beings will due to hatred between themselves.
However, we still have chances.
I am not a futilitarian, but we should strive together for the peace of the world.
Virtuous people, organized!
Pulled by a string tied between two beds in the room of 10 square meters, she got up.
Another new and difficult day coming, she dexterously cooked supper, served father, then hurried to school.
What has burdened such a little girl with a hard life?
Unlike other children enjoying comfortable living conditions and parents' love, she spent her childhood in tears: Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, her father could only lie in bed; Mother mercilessly went away.
Since then, the heavy burden of life fell on the frail shoulders of the girl.
To cure the disease, they had sold all the valuable things except the small house.
Housework and attendance upon Father occupied most of her time after school.
In order to respond to father's demands of having medicine or injection as quickly as possible, she thought of a good idea, tie her ankle to father's bed with a string.
Each time father pulled the string, she could wake up and help him.
Seeing the string and the tiredness of daughter, Father often preferred enduring pain to pulling the string.
Recalling mother's leaving, the little girl felt painful.
After all, she's not at the age of becoming the only hope and support of the family, of tasting the bitterness and hardships of human life .
The misfortune, however, impelled her to grow up.
She demonstrated her strong character not only by hard work at home, but by perfect performance at school.
In teachers and students' eyes, she was a good student; although she had no new clothes, she was very clean.
As time went on, the Spring Festival was coming.
" That was really a beautiful dream.
It is a life tied by string, not a common string, but a "dutiful daughter string" woven by daughter's sweat and true feelings.
My Heart Will Go On
Every night, in the same cafe, at the same table, the same boy appeared.
Each time, he ordered a cup of coffee.
Without adding any sugar, he drank it gradually.
He seemed to be waiting for somebody, who never came.
As ever before, Fei left dorm at 7:20.
On the way, two girls were talking as they were riding bikes in front of Fei.
At the intersection, suddenly another bike appeared like a wind, crashing into one of the two girls.
Without knowing what happened, the girl fell from the bike and hurt her ankle.
"Oh, sorry, but I will be late for class.
" The offender hurried away, without returning.
Seeing this, Fei stopped and came to the girl to asked whether she was OK.
Her ankle swelt, Fei decided to send her to the hospital.
The other girl followed.
Soon, news of Fei's good deed spread all over, but he was still himself.
One night, It rained when Fei was on his way back to the dorm, and he decided to drink something in the nearby cafe until it stopped raining.
He ordered a cup of coffee and then opened his book to save the time.
Suddenly, Fei felt someone standing in front of him.
"Hi, it's you," A girl's figure came into Fei's eyes as he raised his head.
Fei didn't remember who the girl was until the girl sat down opposite him and the waiter brought her a cup of juice.
"You were riding with another girl a few days ago, who was crashed into and whom I sent to the hospital.
You looked more worried than that girl did that day.
I remember you.
" "Yes, I really didn't know what to do at that very moment if it were not for your help.
Thank you.
" The girl smiled to Fei.
"Not at all.
" Silence kept for a while.
"Do you often read here with a cup of coffee in front of you?
" "No," Pointing out of the window, Fei continued, "It's raining.
" "Ha, we are on the same boat!
" The girl raised her voice.
Fei felt blushed, because never before was there such a pretty and lovely girl sitting with him.
Fei staring at his book, without the slightest move of his head.
"It's a good place here, romantic.
Oh, why don't you drink the coffee?
It's turning cold.
" Hearing this, Fei put down the book, took up the coffee cup and drank up quickly.
"It'll never turn cold," the girl added, "but don't you feel bitter when drinking.
You forgot to add sugar.
" "Really?
Oh, sorry, I was just thinking about a maths problem.
I was so absorbed that I forgot to ..." "But I have added some for you just now.
" "... " Fei grinned, He would pay anything he owned if he didn't say anything.
"Sorry, I just had a joke with you.
My name is Qi.
I think we can be friends.
" "My name is Fei and ..." "I know that and I also know you are in the Civil Engineering department.
" Qi interrupted him.
The rain stopped.
From then on, they were friends.
Qi often turned to Fei for help and being together with Qi, Fei felt happy.
He had a feeling, but never spoke it out.
Day after day, the graduation is coming.
Fei couldn't bear the feeling any more.
At last, in the same cafe, at the same table, Qi asked:" I 'll graduate from university tomorrow.
I feel excited.
And you?
" "I... Me, too.
" "You called me here just now when I was preparing for tomorrow.
What's the matter?
You seem unhappy.
" "No.
I just think, we've been friends for two years and I don't know if we will still be friends after graduation.
" "Sure, we will keep in touch however far we are.
" "I'd rather not let you be away from me.
So I can see you everyday.
" Fei stared at the coffee.
"Me, too.
But ... Don't worry.
I will keep you in my mind, my old friend.
" "I mean, I mean we can start ... our ... life.
You know I mean we are happy together and ..." Breathing deadened the cafe.
"Fei, I really thank you.
The last two years are the happiest time in my life that I spent together with you.
I look on you as my elder brother, a reliable brother.
I mean..." It rained.
"I don't want to hurt you...
I think you will attend the graduation ceremony tomorrow and enjoy my speech.
" With these words, Qi left the cafe and disappeared in the rain.
Fei sat there still.
The coffee, Without any sugar added, turned cold.
From then on, they never met, no touch between them.
Qi's figure often appeared in front of Fei.
In the dream, Fei murmured, "Qi, where are you?
I'm waiting for you in the cafe.
"
I was in great need of money.
He had threatened me that if I could not return the money in two days, my ears would be the food of his little fish.
Hooligan as I was, I was ingenious.
I borrowed the money to buy necessary materials and do my little inventions.
So I was in debt of $3000.
How could I get such a large sum of money during a single day?
I had no expensive properties to sell.
All I had were my inventions.
Maybe I should rob a bank.
'Yes, I will.
' Only in this way could I get so much money at once.
I had a gun.
I could use it.
After sticking some moustache on my face, I went out.
After observing several banks, I finally found a suitable one to 'do my job'.
It was not a very large one and few guards were patrolling there.
I went directly to a young service girl.
With a smile on face, she said 'good morning' to me.
But as I put the gun, wrapped in a piece of paper, on the counter, her smile froze.
'Give me $3000, quickly'.
I could feel my voice trembling.
The girl seemed a little calm after a few seconds.
Again smile on face, she asked, 'Would you like it to be in fifty or in ten?
' pretending that there was nothing unusual happening.
'Either will do, only if quickly'.
I was not patient.
I kept looking around.
Fortunately, no one noticed me.
The job was carried out smoothly.
For a third time, the girl was with a smile.
She warped her lips.
I followed subconsciously.
All at once, I found my moustache was loose.
I made it up in a hurry and urged in a low voice, 'Don't snicker, hurry up'.
Finally with a cunning smile on face, the girl passed me the money parcel.
I grabbed it and headed toward the gate.
I ran directly home.
As soon as I got home, I locked the door, panting out of breath.
When I calmed down, I unraveled the parcel to enjoy my harvest.
But to my great surprise, there was nothing but bunches of blank paper.
Oh, my ears, you were doomed to be the food of Tyson's little fish.
Here was no trace of enemy for the moment as far as eye can reach.
Everything fell into silence.
He, drained and depleted, just lay and watched in the trench.
His face was that of a student's with a pair of confused eyes.
Under the sky, the mountains stood still.
Beside him were the corpses of his companions and his own rifle.
He stretched himself out, changed the pose and faced the blue sky.
No, not blue, but gray, the dead gray.
The Sun was unsteady, panting and sighing.
It was the single cloud at this very moment, however, curiously shaped, hanging on the edge of the mountains.
He looked straightly at the cloud with wide-open eyes.
Against the strands of sunlight, the cloud exhibited itself brightly and splendidly.
Its color ranged from pure white to faint yellow, gold, orange, and even purple.
Suddenly the machine guns and rifles broke the silence of the dawn, like dogs barking on the lonely farms.
He reluctantly hauled his eyesight away and looked around.
There was no one in the eyeshot - the enemy was under cover.
He thought for a while, and then moved his eyes to the cloud again.
Now, it sank a little and converted itself into a more capricious shape.
He smiled and murmured to it in spite of the louder gunshots.
Suddenly, a bullet whistled past his ears just beside him.
He cursed and crawled away to the opposite.
However, he still gazed at the cloud, which was almost unseen, only leaving a small part tantalizing him.
Another machine gun ravaged the ground around him with a shower of bullets.
Finally, a bullet hit him mercilessly on the head.
He died immediately with a vestige of smile beside his mouth and the still opened eyes, fixing on the trace of the cloud.
Then it lay still, peacefully.
It was summer.
The air-conditioned compartment was stuffy.
People hustled about in the aisle, occasionally bumping into each other or murmuring something like "sorry", or "excuse me".
As the train started, those who traveled in groups began to chat or play cards.
Those who, like myself, traveled alone either tried to sleep or settled on a book.
I also decided to spend the whole night reading; one of the disadvantages of travelling overnight is that there is no chance to appreciate the landscape outside.
Unfortunately, I could not concentrate.
Maybe I needed a refreshing chat instead, I thought.
Yet around me was only a heated discussion about the stock market -- things that I was ignorant of.
Somehow the girl sitting opposite attracted my attention.
In simple white T-shirt and with a schoolbag, she was apparently a college student.
Contrary to the din around, she was immersed in her own book.
As she read intensively, an unconscious smile nestled in her crystal-like eyes, indicating hearty appreciation of the contents.
I then decided that I might enjoy talking to her; at least we both had a campus experience to share.
But how could I make a start?
I was, by nature, shy and passive.
Reluctantly, I gave up the thought.
Then the service boy on the train came along with tea and coffee.
I bought a cup of coffee to freshen myself up.
As I sat by the window, however, it was difficult to take the hot stuff back.
A stable hand offered timely help.
It was the girl opposite.
I thanked her, and then, nudged by something inside, added, "What are you reading about?
Oh, by the way, I noticed that you are reading something on aesthetics.
May I have a look at the book, please?
" "Of course.
" Then, we exchanged the books and began talking about our reading habits.
The initial barrier between strangers was cast off; the chatterbox was opened.
Or indeed, it was a treasure box that was opened.
I listened to her recommendation of masters' works, remarks on contemporary writers and admiration for her favorite books and authors.
She, in return, got to know my perspective of literary works as an outsider, one whose view is profoundly influenced by "the scientific way of thinking".
Like floods rushing over barren land, the hearty conversation nourished an otherwise lonely night.
Time flashed by.
It was soon dawning.
When the first beam of sunlight gilded the tiny tables and soft couches inside, most of the passengers were still fast asleep.
We were both staying awake for a whole night, yet it felt like dreaming in a sense.
Hours ago we were mere strangers: two individuals that happened to board on the same train.
Minutes later we would bid each other farewell, as old friends.
We could have passed by without knowing each other, were it not for the girl's helping hand, reaching out further beyond necessity,and for my rather abrupt question, bumping slightly out of the sphere of conventionality.
People who have lived an urban life for a long time will find it, sooner or later, a little bit banal.
That is why my friends and I decided to make an adventure in the wild.
When we put our tents, sleeping bags and food into the waterproof packs, we could not refrain the jollity and no one had expected the danger ahead.
Several guides led us into the mountain, and soon became disappointed with our incompetence to walk.
When we arrived at the cataract, it was gloaming, almost two hours later than the guides had planned.
Pain and fatigue, however, made us too exhausted to think of its serious consequences.
We had to surmount the cliff beside the cataract.
I was dumbfounded by the perpendicular of the crag.
It was my turn and I plucked up to climb close to it.
Like the guide, I first put my fingers into the crevice and one foot into the first concave.
Then I cautiously moved the other foot into the same concave and freed the former one to reach the next.
Soon the tension in my legs caused me to tremble, and the tremble caused my fear.
Precarious on the crag, I was unable to move on.
I was soon aware that my strength would run out if no further steps were taken.
So I made a jerk towards the third concave, which cost my balance.
My foot slid from the concave terribly, and I was falling to death.
Just a split of second, finding I was still alive, my heart resumed beating.
The rope below somehow supported me between my waist and the pack and I was pendulous in the air!
Night came and appeared grisly.
Time seemed frozen until I heard someone asking for my hand.
I followed him and felt pulled upward.
The feeling of death was so marvelous that it exorcised all the dread in my heart.
The desire for life was so strong that I exerted the rest of my strength to tug up.
I was helped to touch the crevice and concave again, and I managed to surmount the last concave and joined my friend in tears.
After that moment, all the hardness ahead became nothing to me.
Wading in the water, plodding on the gravel -- all was nothing.
The feeling of death had become an impetus to me.
Even now, having returned to the urban life, that feeling remains intact in my memory.
I don't take it as a nightmare, but rather a nice dream, reminding me the significance of life and endowing me with strength to strive out of every predicament.
When I was in high school, I was in the advanced class.
Famous for our naughtiness and haughtiness, the class was nicknamed 'the Devil Club'.
However, the name made us feel different and we always enjoyed being the little devils of the school.
But maybe Mr. Felton had made an exception.
Mr. Felton was our physics teacher in Senior 2.
He was a man of 40 and always smiling.
But soon we found that his teaching was very poor: what he taught was either simple or wrong.
Many of my classmates expressed their discontent to Ms. Stewart, who was in charge of our class, but the reply was always the same: we were just not adapted to Felton's way of teaching.
However, the more I tried to enjoy his lessons, the more I felt him a nuisance.
Even his smiling looked silly and disgusting.
Greatly annoyed, Mark and I wrote articles about it and sent one copy to the Principal.
We even had a talk with his eminence yet without any effect.
Disappointed and irritated, we knew what the last thing we could do was.
With the thought of revenge, we welcomed the annual poll on teachers' teaching qualities.
Most of us marked Felton with 'D' (the worst level) in every item.
We even instigated many students in other classes to give him a poor grading.
Only by this means, we thought, could we express our dissatisfaction.
As the new semester of Senior 3 was coming, we prayed day by day to have a new physics teacher so as to get rid of Felton.
Yet far beyond my expectation, I was told that he was fired!
I felt a bit sorry for him.
Had he not been assigned to the advanced class, had he not met such devils as we were, such things would never have happened.
A year later, news came that he had got cerebral haemorrhage and become paralyzed.
It was too late to say we didn't mean it.
But maybe after such experience, we could know how to treat people even when they were wrong.

Patriotism  Patriotism means the love of one's country.
It makes one ready to sacrifice his life for his country, and to do many other deeds which can bring benefits to his people.
It makes a country strong and her history glorious.
It also improves a man's character and secures for him widespread fame.
If the people of a country are not patriotic, the country must be very weak.
English Department Sydney University Sydney Australia Foreign Languages Institute Guangzhou China Dear Sir, I am most delighted to have been offered the appointment for he period beginning from 1 February, 1997 to 31 January, 1999.
I am most willing to accept your kind offer.
However, as I am now doing some translation and compilation work in London, I am afraid that the work will not be finished until August, 1997. therefore, I would like to suggest that the appointment be made from 1 September.
1997 to 31 August, 1999.
Thank you very much for your offer.
I sincerely hope that my work in London will be of great benefit to the Institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation work I may be called upon to do.
I look forward to your early reply.
Yours sincerely,                 Robert Lee
A patriotic person will do anything for his motherland, even to die.
In the history of our nation, there are numerous patriotic persons, such as Yuefei, Zhen cheng gong and Li zhe qu.
The general meaning of patriotism is the same, however, the definition of it in different eras varies.
You can compare what Yuefei had done with what Li zhe qu had done.
On the other hand, the patriotism of the revolutionary period is quite different.
What they have done was to liberate the working class, to liberate our whole nation, not for a man, but for every Chinese.
The definition of patriotism had been developed and advanced.
Guilin's waters and mountain also help the city to make a lot of money.
That's to say, the income of the tourist cites depends on tourism.
They can hardly give you any impression because they themselves have few features.
When I contrasted it with GUFL, which I'm now studying at, it showed a great difference.
In order to identify it completely we can try to make contrast about their fame, area, environment, teaching facilities and entertaining facilities.
I'm sure that GUFL couldn't be so attractive .
We don't have to know the exact number.
We can find that half of the area in GUFL is covered by teachers' buildings.
That's quite different from the situation of ZU.
With the help of Baiyun Hill, GUFL provides a beautiful scene to s --- trees and flowers are seen all around.
The roads in ZU are usually kept tidy, while we can often see dust on the roads in GUFL.
The main reason why ZU can enjoy a good fame comes from its perfect teaching and entertaining facilities.
Its library is the largest of all university libraries in Guangdong.
When turning back to GUFL's poor library and its football field, which is overed by high grass, we have to shake our heads with pity!
A Friend is a person who shares the same feelings of natural liking and understanding, the same interests, etc.
It can be divided into two: close friends and common friends.
When your friend was sad or uncomfortable, you had no reason to be happy man.
But that's impossible for a common friend to do--- they even don't know when you're sad and hen you're happy.
That's quite different from what a close friend shows.
For example, we meet some of our teachers almost everyday, but not all of them can be our friends.
Sometimes we even hate them.
In this case we meet to have classes, not for the purpose of making friends.
"A friend in need is a friend indeed.
" Those who cannot help you solve your problems aren't called " A FRIEND.
" A real friend will try his best to help you --- this kind of help is based on faithfulness, not on money or some other benefits.
Generally, a friend will always support you and fight with the difficulties and your opponents together with you.
But if necessary, he will fairly point out your mistakes to help you improve and make more progress.
One day I chatted with my close friend Denise in the institute.
We sat side by side on a bench.
Suddenly, she cried in joy " Look!
Cat!
" How fat and lovely it is!
" Denise said, with her eyes twinkling.
" Yes," I was surprised " Do you like cats too?
" I thought that normally girls would like dogs better than cats.
" Certainly, I loved them when I was still a little girl.
" She became more and more excited.
" I know.
How is it now?
" She turned her face and said in sadness: " She has been dead.
" " I'm sorry ... Because of illness?
" I asked.
" Maybe, She didn't eat anything although I fed her with much delicious food.
Later, she got dead.
I know the mood that she was in.
" Denise slightly nodded her head.
" She has gone.
" I noticed that she was staring at the cat which had the similar appearance of hers, and now ran away.
No doubt, she was referring to it.
" I continued.
" Yes.
And I wish I were, but.
.." she stopped and sighed.
" Life is life.
I loved them more and more, and, spent most of my spare time playing with them.But they were lost or killed by others.
You seem to be comparatively lucky, right?
" " Yes," Denise sighed again and said.
" Why can't the animals be treated as equally as us human-beings?
" " Ha ha.
" I laughed, " That seems not possible yet.
But let's wish that some day in the future it will come true.
Well, I have something to do now.
See you next time.
" " See you".
Then we left.
Describing A Person: When the sun was shining in the middle of the sky .
Now and then he put his right hand upon the pistol tied on the belt.
The gun was so heavy together with big hand that the belt sloped to the right a little.
But at the moment he seemed totally unaware of the weight on his waist, heading to the police office.
Under the smart velvet hat was his clear- cut feature: keen eyes, dark eye brows, straight nose and the firm and dignified jaw.
he looked serious.
His eyebrow frowned and his mouth tightly shut.
He had a well-built figure and a straight back, from which one could conclude he had used to be a handsome young man and popular among the community.
Even though today his youth had faded with years, his popularity remained, not because of his apperance but because of his trust-worthiness.
Nov. 8th.
An early morning, a father with his two little girls has arrived at the gate of the hospital, waiting to visit his wife who has just given birth to a boy.
It is still early; the locked iron with wire screen looks like a stern guard, resolved o separate the hospital and the outside world.
A scarlet number 27 is printed on the wall, contrasting the grey pavement.
A lovely girl, about two years old, is sitting on his father's shoulders.
Her little hands are dragging the collar of her father's flannel overcoat.
The father, like his little girls, looks wistful, firmly holding the girls little leg, with his sinecry big hands.
Her hair looks like a mess of cabbage.
Her hands are grasping the cold iron bar; it seems as if she wanted to squeeze her little head through the gate.
Describing What People Do I am one of those who are never able to sleep like a log, so I can tell exactly at what time the lights are turned on every morning.
The biological clock in my body works so well that by the time the lights are on, that is at six o'clock, I have been turning over on the bed, fully aware the light will be on at any time in the next fifteen minutes.
Usually at this moment most girls are still struggling on their beds to get up, so I am always the first one to get there.
I first remove the lid from the sterilized bottle, take out the fragile lenses and put them on my left palm.
Then pour several drops of sterilizing liquid on them and use my right forefinger to gently rub the lenses.
When they are dried up, I carefully put them into my eyes, as if I was holding a precious diamond on my finger-tips.
The above is just what I usually do in the morning of Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
After lunch when I am in bed again for a nap, your little Mary(is it?
) is hammering on the floor, giving me another 2 tomenting hours.
And I have to stay up till 2' clock in the morning, waiting for the music to stop.
You know, I havn't got enough money to buy a new flat and I rally don't want to break down at this age.
I hope you will understand me and help me.
Classes I have Attended  There are two kinds of classes I have attended: Useful and useless.
No matter they are useful or useless, I have to attend them throughout the terms.
I am very interested in these classes and pay great attention to them.
I come to these classes 5 minutes before the class begin and eave them 10 minutes after the classes are over, asking questions to the teachers.
During the classes, I take down every word of the teacher.
I have my eyes on the teachers throughout the classes.
I have never missed any homework of these classes.
In these classes ,I learn how to write an English address for my neighbour, I learn how to talk with a foreigner on the train.
The rest of the classes I have attended are completely useless.
I have never been in time for these classes.
More often than not , I leave these classes 15 minutes before the teachers leave.
During these classes, I either play my " game boy", or make plans for inviting my girlfriend, Mimy, to Kara OK.
I neither listen to the teachers nor take notes.
Actually, I got nothing from these classes.
These are the classes I have attended, I hope all the classes I attend will be useful in the future.
Shi Zui Xian and Yun Bei Beside the north gate of GIFL, there are two Da-pai-dangs , One is called Shi Zui Xian, the other is called Yun Bei.
The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are well ventilated and very bright, while those of Yun Bei are not.
The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are also more spacious than those of Yun Bei.
So, I really think that Shi Zui Xian is a much better place for dinner than Yun Bei.
This time you just listen to the tape played by the teacher and do the exercises in the book.
.
After that, you should be prepared to answer the teacher's questions.
What follows reading is usually the writing task, you are often required to write a short paragraph or something else , The most interesting thing of the class is the talking activity, in which the class usually ends.
In this activity, you should form either in pairs, or in groups, The topics are usually given in the book.
Sometimes you have debates besides discussions with your classmates.
Quite often you will finish your class in great exhaustion and of course, you will learn a lot in this class.
Boredom Boredom is the feeling that one has when he has too much to do or has nothing to do.
Everyone is complaining about boredom and trying to get rid of it.
I waited and waited at the busstop for a No 10 Bus.
"Excuse me.
"Well", he said even more anxiously, "Could you tell me how I can get to Jiang Cun?
" I was quite familiar with that place, and pointing to the board of the bus stop, I said " Bus No.
36 will take you right there.
" And I turned back from him to see whether my bus was coming.
"Bus No 3?
" he said again, pulling my shirt.
"And how much does the ticket cost?
" Oh, 40 fen," he said, seemingly even more anxiously.
" Well, could you please give me 40 fen for the ticket ?
" " Why?
" I became a little bit angry.
" I'm very sorry " he said, putting his bag in front of me.
I just want 40 fen to return home.
" This time my anger disappeared and groped in my wallet for 40 fen.
However, I could not find the small changes.
" I'm very sorry, I really have no small change and the smallest note is 10 Yuan.
" No sooner than I had finished saying, he said happily, "Ok, I can give you the change of 9.6 yuan !
" I said nothing.
I was sure my mother had prepared supper for my father and I .
This was a round shaped and black table with four legs.
And then, on the table, there was a vase which was made of glass in the centre of the table.
On the right of each bowl.
You can see many black powder on it.
It looks a bit dirty.
It is made of cane.
This cushion is black and white.
On the right of the chair .
(there is ) a broom stands there.
On the low of the globe .
A man and his two little daughters are standing in front of a gate which is made of iron.
From his wrinkly hand and rough profile.
I can say he is a blue-collar worker.
Years old .
She is wearing a white coat which is furry.
She is sitting comfortably.
She is standing beside her father, putting her hands into her pockets.
They look a little sad and very tired.
Because the man had a quarrel with his wife about a trivial matter yesterday.
This room No.
27 is her aunt's house.
They got up very early this morning and came here for apology.
They are looking through the gates eagerly and waiting for someone to open the locked door.
I do hope his wife will forgive him.
The first thing I do is to make my bed.
After washing, I begin to prepare my breakfast.
I put some water into my electric cup.
Maybe I pay much attention to my breakfast, because it makes me full of energy during the day.
Until 7:30 .
Etc.
At 7:45.
I walk on my way to the classroom  To be a secretary is not as simple as you think.
Guangzhou is an attractive city.
Since the open policy was practiced in 1978.
Its economy is developing at a rapid rate.
People think that Guangzhou is an ideal place to earn money.
So many people crowd here to make a living.
Lifany was one of this kind of persons.
She was twenty years old with a pretty face.
The young man told her that he could find a good job for her in Guangzhou.
She asked the young man when she could work..
The young man told her that he had found a secretary job.
He took Li fang to the room and asked her to wait for her boss there for interview .
Lifang did as the young man said.
She stayed in the room alone after the young man left.
The room had nothing except a bed and a chair.
After a while, someone opened the door with a key.
He closed the door and locked it.
When he saw Lifang, he sprang on her liked wolf.
Lifary was frightened and struggled hard to get free.
The old guy told her coldly that he had paid the young man 30,000 yuan for buying her.
If she did not obey him, she had to pay back to him.
I think I can do nothing except breaking the contract with you and move out immediately.
I was told there are three girls living together above me.
I don't understand why they make noise all the time.
It seems they never get tired.
I can not sleep any more.
So drinking coffee in the morning has become my hobby.
In order to make me awake .
I usually say to myself, Please allow me to have a good night.
Read 10,000 volumes and travel 10,000li.
I think I prefer scenic spots to ncient relics.
Last summer vocation.
I went to Xian with some friends for travel.
We traveled the tomb of the Chinese Emperor and thousands of life.
I could not enjoy it.
Another thing I disliked is that we could not take photo there.
I am not interested in ancient history, so I felt very dull and went out alone before they finished the visit.
It has many small pavilions, terraces, display rocks and flower beds.
I can remember the whole story, and I often tell the other people, Then we traveled the lake by boat, The water was green clear and very quiet.
On the each dike.
This place is really strongly impressed on my memory.
People say in heaven is paradise, on earth are Suzhou and Hangzhou.
This saying is true.
I have been to two kinds of restaurants .
When you enter a high class restaurant, you must dress well.
Then, two or three waitresses in uniform will come to you, one will make tea for you.
She is so patient and hospitable that you don't want to refuse her.
She smiles broadly on her face, try her best to please you.
When you look around, everywhere is so quiet.
Of course, the environment and condition of the restaurant are luxurious.
The service charge of high lass restaurant will make you headache.
During the meal, you can not talk freely.
Sometimes, fter you finish your meal, you still feel hungry.
But the bill of the meal is very expensive.
There is no service charge there and the tea is free too.
You can talk willingly.
Friend Friend is one part of our life.
Because they like to make friends .
They think friends are as important as their life.
And live a happy life .
They enjoy loneliness.
Two or three close friends are enough for them.
A friend indeed is a friend in need.
This is my definition of a friend.
When I come across difficulty.
In daily life, we can share joys and sorrows.
Once, I got fever.
In school .
Only lay in bed all the day .
Susan knew this, she came to my room quickly after class.
She took me to the school clinic.
Cooked meal for me and took good care of me .
I cried the second time.
In my daily life.
They think a boyfriend is enough for them.
To me.
I can't accept this.
This will make me crazy.
Rose is my roommate.
She is very lovely and amiable.
We always play together, going to the classroom hand in hand every morning, making joke in our dormitory.
She has become my close friend since we knew each other.
So I get up earlier than Rose.
Other roommates usually go out very early.
The room was so quiet yesterday morning.
I knew only Rose was still in bed.
I concentrated my mind on the VOA report.
Suddenly, I felt two hands was holding my neck tightly behind me.
" Oh, ghost!
She walked away.
We didn't talk to each other for a long time.
I persuaded myself to forget it.
I looked at the watch.
" Shall we go to the classroom " I said gently.
She still kept silence on our way to classroom.
I told her a humorous conversation.
Last Sunday was my birthday and my mother asked me.
" What kind of gift do you want me to send you " I prefer a peace and quiet environment " I answered.
Dear sir.
I have been your downstairs neighbour for nearly one year.
I am quite heartened to have a hard-working and easy-going neighbour like you.
However, in recent mouths, I have been suffering a great deal of noise coming from your apartment which makes me quite upset and to write you this letter.
I am not criticizing your schedule here,but I do need uiet as your neighbour.
I used to have the habit of going to bed early at night.
But I am now changing it for your sake.
Every night you return rather late and make a lot of noise which awakes me quite often.
Again I am not blaming you for your habit, but I would be most grateful if you could make your steps softer and your movement less noisy on return.
It always took me half an hour to wait for the end of the noise of the bumps of door and chairs etc.
Your final two heavy bumps of throwing your leather shoes sometimes almost frightened my heart to jump out.
Living in the same building, I think we have got to establish a good relationship between us, which simply means our mutual respect to each other.
I hope you will share my opinion and allow me a quiet and easy life.
With my best regards.
Yours faithfully     Zhang Long    Parties I Have Been To Three kinds of parties have presented me with various feelings: festival party, birthday party and farewell party.
They have brought to me happiness.
Festival party is the kind that I enjoyed most.
For I did feel happy in attending it.
While celebrating the festival n forms of singing.
I met lots of acquaintances in the parties, who were equally cheerful as I was.When talking about the impression,we all agreed that the party was great.
Birthday party sometimes made me feel bored and embarrassed, for I was sometimes invited to a stranger's birthday party.
Not knowing how to formulate my best wishes, I sat there in silence, ith a forced smile on the face, This always made people feel that I was uncommunicative and I often failed to give any xplanation to redeem my image.
Even when attending a friend's birthday party I still felt uncomfortable.
I used to attract so much attention that the host, who had expected to be the key man in the party, became unhappy with me.
And it has always been too late for me to realize that I had made myself ridiculous.
Farewell party is the kind of party bringing me unspeakable sadness.
The atmosphere of it had been expected to be joyful.
But we always failed to restrain our reluctant feeling to part and the party used to end up in a sad atmosphere, with everybody in tears or in a bad mood.
There will certaintly be more parties ahead for me to ttend.
I will also be supposed to behave properly.
I wish there would e some new kinds of parties different from those I have tended nd I could feel happier and comfortable in them.
Two Different Schools Guangzhou University of Foreign Languages (GUFL) and Linan University are surely of two different types as far as their environment.
As to INU.
Moreover, the four main gates of INU are usually open to the outside world, which makes people outside always go in for a sightseeing or merely for a rest.
So the school is now becoming more and more like a public park.
The academic atmosphere in INU seems to be more active than that in GUFL.
Various kinds of lectures , discussions or debates are held in INU almost every week, focusing on international trade and finance issues stock market problems and social phenomena etc.
Students take active part in these ctivities and bring their talents and knowledge from textbooks into full play.
However.
People in GUFL seem to be indifferent in such activities which will actually benefit them a lot.
GUFL is proud of its colorful entertainment activities which include singing contest.
Every season we have various activities to add colors to our life.
All these activities are organized by the school and are all successful.
In INU the situation is a bit different.
So you can only find some small scale entertainment activities held by each department.
They thus don't cause any sensation.
There are only few activities which are organized by the school and can round off.
CUFL and INU may have many things in common as an university.
But they really differ in the above aspects.
How to learn the CECL Course  The full name of CECL is Communicative English for Chinese Learners.
It is a course for English majors and is taken as a practice in GUFL.
In using this textbook, students will be instructed to do the reading.
For the listening comprehension exercises, students will be required to listen to a dialogue or something else about how the foreigners feel about Chinese food or the process of cooking a Chinese dish etc.
Students will then need to grasp the main ideas and write them down or to use the information they have heard to fill in blanks or charts.
The most active step in learning this course is the oral practice.
Students will be encouraged to discuss certain topics about the unit between them, Sometimes with the help and organization of the teacher, the students will have an animated debate.
Having finished the unit, the students will usually be asked to write an essay or composition about the topic they have dealt with, writing down their feelings or impressions.
A pair of earphones is also provided for each student for their listening exercises.
CECL does have many advantages in training students' comprehensive ability.
It helps to broaden the students' knowledge as well.
When you are lonely and depressed, you may need a friend to be with you, for you need someone who is patient enough to listen to you and to propitiate your sorrow or anger.
A friend is a person who knows you well and is inclined to share your misfortune when you are in trouble.
Sometimes you may merely feel like to talk to someone to have our happiness shared by more people.
Again you need your friends to be with you.
You may have a good time together and this hilarity will surely drive away your loneliness.
Some people may think that a friend is a person who can give help and support.
But I would like to claim that a friend is a person whom you need not to wear disguise before.
You may tell him or her your secret and he or she will keep it for you.
When you suffer frustration in job, life and love etc.
You may go to find your relief and pleasure in friendship.
A friend is a person whom you may go for help without the least hesitation and ceremony.
That was a rather cold winter morning.
But there were a group of homeless people-a father and his two daughters.
Several little children, who were tidy, lovely, were playing happily around their mother.
They are singing, dancing, playing with their little dog.
They apparently knew nothing about the cold world outside the room.
The little girl sitting on his father's shoulder appeared to be totally attracted by the sign she saw.
Something was glimmering in her bright blue eyes.
Maybe that night she would have a good dream of cake and candy.
Her eyes were directed by every movement of the woman.
The tears dimmed her eyes.
He appeared to see nothing about the happy life inside because at that moment he was occupied by the hard work of thinking out a place for his two kids to sleep before dark.
Every morning in the school, my life is just like a race in which I have to try best to get ahead.
If not, I will surely be put in a very negative state.
In cold winter morning, getting out of my warm bed is always a terrible thing for me.
I have no time to listen to her nonsense because my mind is fully occupied by another urgent business-- capture a tap in the washing room!
At that moment, I make a vow that next day I will get up very early!
People are running with their wild hairs, a cloud of dirt like thousands of horses passing by.
But you never think the annoying struggle is coming to the end.
Then I sit at the table and supplement the energy lost in the previous struggles.
When I look at my watch, I find this only enjoyment is impossible.
Because it is always over crowded.
I got to the station one hour's early of the departure time.
Many of them could not buy tickets and wandered all away outside the station.
The situation there was not much better than outside.
All the seats were occupied by peasants who unvariedly carried three or four bags with them, Many without a seat simply sat on the ground.
Her mouth opened slightly and slumbered.
All seemed that the girl concerned nothing about her manner.
With great disgust, Zhang shouted at her " Hey!
Even with a lay of dust on her face you could find immediately that she had a very smooth and fair skin.
And then she spoke to me: "Get ready for pushing.
Following the nimble girl who was like a fish swimming skillfully in the sea of people, I almost lost my sense.
I didn't know whether my feet till touched the floor and my left arm pulling my bag behind still belonged to me.
I only knew that somebody's leg would vp9,3-2] tripped me up if the girl had not held my hand.
I thought I was done for at that time.
Something hooked my sweater and made a big hole in it.
What a nightmare!
What a terrible experience!
At that time, I thought of the beautiful girl and looked around the train, but I never saw her again.
Since the tourist industry is flourishing in recent years, and more people are involved in it.
Many young people are holding jobs as tourist guides.
Like other occupations, the job of a guide has its own advantages and drawbacks so it is hard to say it is good or bad.
Sometimes it can be very attractive and profitable, Sometimes it will be rather unpleasant.
I remember that was a sunny spring day.
When I first saw her, I almost couldn't recognize her.
" I am gong to die.
" She said with little energy as soon as she saw me.
Then you have to answer all kinds of silly questions raised by dozens of them.
It is very boring.
I have to repeat the same story hundreds of times and even so, still there are some foolish fellows who can not make clear and keep asking without an end.
Usually, I can't have lunch in time which causes serious problems in my stomach.
So, I advise you: Do not take up the job as a tourist guide, or you'll regret!
" "No, I won't " she refused me without hesitation.
"You know, though the job is rather tiring, it is really a money-making one.
" Her answer confused me.
Sometimes I just can't understand why people do things which they don't like.
Is money so important?
Maybe, I'll understand it in some future day.
Gary Cooper was the kind of man who you will never forget once you see him.
Even in a crowd of people you can have no trouble in pointing him out at once both because of his enormous height and a scarcely-seen stern face.
He was wearing a smart white shirt and a pair of black trousers.
A high quality black leather waistcoat was suitably covered on.
His nose was extremely long and straight which made you immediately associate with the one made of plaster stone.
His mouth was held tightly and the corners of the mouth bent downward cynically.
His eyes was fierce and full of determination.
There was always a slice of sneer hanging on his face where some kind of murderous intent was hiding behind.
He was forging ahead with a face as cold as ice.
For this time, I have to admit that being a neighbour of your family is really a great suffering and a nightmare.
I can hardly find a word to describe the disturbance you've brought to us.
Sometimes Your activities can even go late into night.
All these bring much unhappy experience to us and also do great harm to our health.
However, friends of the second type are very sentimental.
patient and warm-hearted people.
They do not like talking too much and always seem to be sunk into deep reverie whenever you meet them.
But they are surely good listeners and worth of full trust.
Once I was treated unfairly by a person and felt very annoyed, wanting to blow off the steam.
I told the whole thing to my friend.
After that I felt quite comfortable and to a certain extent, a sense of victory.
They listen to you and never lose patience until you feel better.
I love my friends of the first kind, for they bring me much happiness.
Can you choose another time?
Or if you do feel you can't live without singing.
Besides, you should pay more attention to your vulnerable throat !
I like those people of sanguine disposition.
They are out-going, never short of friends or companies.
They are the friends talking with my deep heart, which is isolated from the reality and some time become my own voice.
They don't talk much, they only like to listen.
Through their eyes, you know they care about you,despite the indifference shown on their faces.
When I think about my friends,I think of myself.
Since friends are always a mirror of your life.
Among them, two impressed me deeply.
It was set up during Han Dynasty by a county official and now becomes one of the key schools in our province.
>From its buildings, which are covered with red and green stones located in the garden, which are enclosed with the dates and events happened down the history as a monument to the school, you will have no surprise to hear that it was appointed by the state government as a historical preservation unit.
Dear Sir, I'm sorry but have to write to you, otherwise, I'll probably lose my hearing if your children continue leading a life in such a mess.
Usually the radio is turned on with some "bang" and crash sounds.
Then, they start their morning boxing exercises instead of going to school.
I should admit they're making progress, because I found more and more sands falling down from your balcony.
The wheels make a harsh sound killing my ears.
I'll be very grateful if I can spend a day quietly.
Yours, CLASSES I HAVE ATTENDED Three kinds of classes I have attended make my way of taking classes changing from time to time.
All the students lower their heads, seemingly attentive to something.
The teacher finds some materials that we'll never find, then, read one sentence by sentence to us.
Of course, not all the classes I've attended are like that.
Usually the atmosphere is warm.
Only at that time, can I feel the art of teaching and experience the happiness of learning.
This has been my impression on the classes I've attended in this institute and I wish I'll always have that last kind.
But there's only a bituminous road between the schoolB's, gate and the main teaching building -the 10-storey chemical Building.
The chemical Building is obviously newly built.
As you go further, you'll find that, as a college, A is much smaller in size than B which is a university.
Only two or three more teaching buildings are scattered around the main building of A, containing all the classrooms and offices for 4 departments.
About 10 minutes' walk will be enough for you to get a general idea of A's layout.
However, you can hardly make B's layout clear if you have no bike and are not willing to spend at least half an hour.
Both boys and girls choose what interests them as their majors.
In A, girls wearing beautiful clothes are walking on the campus practising oral English or, with a radio in hand , listening to VOA'S special English.
But it's a totally different picture in B--in dormitories, books everywhere, dirty clothes thrown on beds and socks under beds, boys are sitting quietly at the desks, working on piles of assignments the professors have just assigned.
So, to take a CECL class, students do not necessarily preview the text.
The only thing they would do is to get their earphones ready .
In sports, there will be the names of various sport games, rules, etc.
In every unit, there are activities for students to act and talk.
Thus, in CECL class, the atmosphere is always warm and exciting.
It's not listening lesson, neither oral English lesson nor writing lesson.
A Friend A friend is who, when you have been painstakingly travelled along your river of life and want some support , appears like a paddle of a boat.
A friend is the breeze in summer and the bright sunshine in winter.
" he says slowly but firmly.
"How about a wrestling, we two?
" He finds a way for you to blow off your steam.
you have got to work now!
A friend shares your sorrows and happiness.
But you know him and understand him just as he always treats you appreciate your.
As time passes by, maybe you have charged a lot and so has he.
Maybe you two are far away from each other.
But a friend, who really deserves the word "friend" ,will never be far away.
A friend is a priceless treasure.
Returning books During the break, I went hurriedly to return some Chinese books.
Suddenly, I heard an angry voice," These cheats!
Such rotted gourd worth $2 per jin!
" With these words , a head rose from below the counter.
Then another, "you have got to stand it !
They can do anything for that !
" And she then started to complain how she had been cheated once.
" They stopped, turning to me.
It seemed as if a volcano would erupt.
"Pass it to me!
" the younger lady came to me, checking the books," you made these marks?
" she asked me coldly, lifting her eyebrows.
" You are doomed!
" I said to myself.
" She raised her voice.
I made no answer -I could only admit it was a good lesson.
At the very moment, the elder lady joined the younger one.
"Another scribbler?
FIWE!
How many has she got?
One ...Three... Six ...!!
That's $ 1.
2!
" No sooner had I caught what she said them a fine fill was in front of me.
Skillful assistant!
And I spent $1.2 buying a good lesson..
Dear Mr Smith, I'm sorry to disturb you .
I've been living for 5 years and used to have a peaceful and tranquil life.
But since you moved in last month.
You go to concert every night and come back late.
When I wake up.I am unable to drop back to sleep soon.
The music is good but a little bit louder.
In addition to that.
It drives my sleep away.
When I am lying in bed with eyes open, I can clearly hear the jazz music from the recorder,the laughter f your friends and I even know that one of your friend is nicknamed " cooodpecker" .
I do not mean to put my nose into your affair, but how can I possibly keep the noise out of my house?
With best wishes.
Because it is rare to obtain.
Common interests link us together and critical time tests the soundness of the friendship.
They are unlikely to make offences for we know that such frankness is true and sincere.
We share the secrets, rapture and sorrow.
I welcome nodding friends and cherish good will and sincerity toward them.
And when meeting by chance.
Even when we happen to have disputes no one bother to speak out .
They often bring laughter and fun to my life, and even a "Hello" in the street makes my heart light.
Because I know they can flatter me to the top of the sky when I am in luck, and they can also shovel me on the ground and pique my dignity.
I have been in two middle schools to receive my secondary education.
One is the Attached Middle School of GUFL, the other is Guangzhou No.2 Middle School.
First, No.
Due to the large number of applicants, the school is able to undergo strict selection.
he students are not only required to digest the knowledge in the book, but also trained by doing a lot of additional and more complicated exercises to expand their skill.
Although it is not a boarding school.
There are often sudden checks on this.
Those who violate the rules would be criticized openly.
This phenomenon however has never happened in the Attached School.
In each unit, there includes the training of listening , reading, oral English writing and role play .
Students may look up the words in the dictionary and get themselves familiar with the meanings and us ages.
Listening exercises, which , often is the first part in a unit , need no preparations.
Before the exercise begins, the teacher will give several minutes for the students to look through the instructions as well as the questions.
Then they may listen to the tape twice and do the task (either fill in some blanks or answer questions ) at the same time.
Since the articles in a certain unit are all selected to introduce the topic from different angles, it is important that the students have mastered the essence of it.
Group discussion appears in a unit frequently.
The topics discussed are closely concerned with the unit.
Students are encouraged to express their ideas freely.
Role play is another kind of practice.
It calls for the students to take part in the play without teachers intervention.
They use what they have learned from the unit and try to make the play as vivid and real as possible.
There is no doubt that our life is colorful .
What is boredom then?
It is a dull, uninteresting tedious feeling people have when they have nothing to do or are not interested in doing the things at hand.
Students in our class all agree that The Construction of Socialism is boring, not at all because we have anti-government idea or we dislike the idea.
What use does his lecture have while we have eyes to read the textbook ourselves?
Boredom is a company not only to students but also to those who work and don't work.
You may still feel bored.
It is how I felt when I went to the Trade Fair a few weeks ago.
When there were few customers we did nothing but talk or go round and round.
This let's-sit-here-and-talk-to-kill-the-time pattern bored me a lot and I was tired and uninterested in anything.
This is a funny experience I will never forget.
One day, with 20 yuan in my trousers' pocket I went to downtown area with a friend.
The No.
36 bus we took was crowded .we got on and stood near the door .
Just then, I felt there was a slight touch of my pocket, as if something was moving inside I looked down to find the money was somehow drawn out and was about to fall to the floor I could hear my heart beat faster than ever, knowing clearly that I had become a bait of a thief.
Hurriedly I pushed the money back, turned suddenly back and faced the young man behind me.
Obviously he didn't expect that would happen .
"well," I said in a low voice, "didn't get it , Eh?
" my words took him by surprise.
Perhaps he had wanted me to keep silent or abuse him loudly and get beaten.
"It is really bad luck, isn't it ?
" I asked him, nearly jokingly.
I was surprised why my heart was not at my throat when I spoke to the man and I still do not know now.
And this moment is 1997, arriving in several hours from now, as we are approaching July 1st.
Patriotism, which is something beyond words, is what people of different nationalities share universally, and is also a blessing for every nation.
They care for nothing but their country.
We Chinese always take pride in our patriotism.
We owe all our delighting and impressive achievements to our leadership, to our people's efforts, to international aids and above all to the profound patriotism in everyone of us.
In this sense, patriotism means a lot to a nation especially to such a big country as China which was burdened with myriad historic wounds and is expecting countless obstacles and challenges to come.
The story of Hong Kong tells much of this.
People of the same nationality and therefore possessing the same ardent patriotism want to be united together and have to be together.
It is a dream to come true.
My Grandmother  My grandmother is a kind peasant woman.
She spends most of her life in the village.
She takes good care of her grandchildren and gives them every comfort.
They all love her and she loves them also.
My grandmother had too much to do in running a house.
As our family was not wealthy, she had to do everything herself.
She fed the pigs, chickens, ducks and geese, and watered the vegetables.
She prepared the meals and washed the clothes.
In the harvest season, she must help in the field.
She is also a thrifty and industrious woman.
She saves every penny as she can.
But she works as hard as ever.
Now she is still raising a group of chickens and planting a patch of vegetable.
Often she says to us, "Work while you work, play while you play.
If you do not work, you will become lazy and of no use.
" What good advice she has given to us!
We must live up to it and always keep it in mind.
What does my father look like?
Each time when we were together, I just wanted to escape from him.
Common as he was, I wouldn't find anything particular about my father to brag before my classmates.
I would ask myself whether I would choose to be his son if I had the chance before I was born.
Also, it seemed that he didn't care about me much and just let me go my own way.
There must be a gap between us, I always thought.
It was just after I had received the notice that I was accepted by Zhongshan University that a banquet was held.
All of my relatives came to congratulate me on it.
He wasn't the one he used to be.
What astonished me most was that father got drunk that night, for as a bus driver, he never drank more than a little glass of beer.
I felt something unusual about dad that night.
I knew he was proud of me, and I was proud to have a father like him as well.
I will be his son.
Forever.
In western countries, there has the first day of Xmas gift shopping the shopping is on all day long, street lights and store windows are decorated with the traditional Xmas colours of red and green.

Quickly, Spring Festival ends after the traditional Lantern Festival.
Galileo  Galileo was born in Pisa, Italy in February, 1564.
He was the famous physicist all over the world when he was 19,he made his first important discovery-the Isochronism of Pendulum, by chance, which is applied today in the measurement of time, the eclipses of the sun, and the movement of the stars.
Galileo had even been a professor of Mathematics in the University of Pisa.
During that time, he challenged the great Aristotle's theories by conducting an experiment regarding the laws of bodies in motion and got the famous theory that two different weights dropped simultaneously from the same height, would fall to the ground at the same time.
While in Padua, Galileo had written a book concerning the movement of heavenly bodies.
I'm against the verdict that the boy was not guilty.
First, I believe that what the old man said was true.
It's possible for him to hear the boy say "I'm going to kill you" though the train was roaring over and it's also possible for him to walk to the front door from his bed within 15 seconds.
If the old man did hear the words and then hear the sound of the falling of a body, think of it, it's not a wonder for the old man to get to the front door as quickly as possible to see what had happened.
It's true that people usually don't wear glasses to bed.
But that does not mean there is no exception.
What's more, the woman's eyesight has not been examined, and in fact, we have no idea about her exact eyesight situation.
How can we draw the conclusion that she could not see the murderer even if she didn't wear her glasses.
Finally, let's turn to the downward angle of the knife.
They said if the boy had ever used a switch knife, he would never stabbed downward.
But how can we know the boy was experienced with switch knives?
And even if the boy was, since the stabbing probably happen after a struggle, the knife was not necessarily used underhanded.
We can not exclude the possibility that the boy killed his father accidentally in the struggle.
In that case, the angle can be downward.
So, all comes to this: the boy was guilty.
Chinese and Americans have different cultures.
In China, the Spring Festival is from December 24 to January 15 next year in lunar calendar.
And you will see many kinds of colorful balloons and firecrackers everywhere.
Snowmen, Santa Claus, shepherds, angels, and Nativity scenes appear in countless shop windows.
Families decorate their homes, inside and out, with colored lights and evergreens.
The whole family will enjoy a big happy dinner which we call a reunion dinner.
In China, on the New Year's Day, the children should get up earlier than their parents and kowtow to them, then they can get their lucky money.
Now of course they needn't kowtow.
So in the new year the children are very rich.
They can buy everything they like.
Although the Spring Festival in China is different from the Christmas in US, they are of the same importance to people.
Perhaps the Americans have the same feeling with me.
In fact, I don't think so.
I think it's a serious problem.
In studying the two different courses, there are resemblances and differences.
The resemblances are such as carefulness, memory, and observation.
Carefulness is the most important in doing everything.
With care, you can distinguish two similar things easily and can find something other people can't see.
So carefulness can improve your memory and observant skill.
You will confuse them easily unless you rememorize them frequently.
In studying science, there are only some main formulas you should memorize.
Then you should learn to use them to deduct the others.
So if you have a good head for logic, that's very good.
Studying is very flexible.
It's hard to say which method is the best.
Different people study in different ways.
But, I have a special night on that day.
Time flies, that night is still my most memorable d-Autumn Festival night.
I used to enjoy the Mid-autumn Festival night together with my parents.
I'd never made an appointment with a young man at night before.
I'd never fallen in love with a man before.
The Mid-Autumn Festival of this year was the most memorable.
In the past I spent the festival with my family at home.
This year, I had to stay at our university and spent the night with y fellow villagers.
I felt as if I had come back home and stayed with my family.
On that night, I enjoyed myself, enjoyed everything.
It happened it was also my little niece's birthday.
It was a surprise, she said.
My niece looked sad and asked, Don't you think you forget something?
" We pretended not to notice it.
"Oh, yes, I forget to turn off the tap.
" said my mother, smiling, and went to the kitchen.
"Let me help you, mame.
" I excused myself into the kitchen.
"Happy birthday to you, honey.
" With tears in her eyes, the little thing gave each of us a kiss.
We spent the night joyously, which I will remember forever.
I will never forget that Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
My friends and I went to climb Baiyun Mount to see the lunar eclipse.
We planned that we should arrive at the summit of the mount before 1 am.
The bright moon hung in the sky .
The breeze brushed trees as it they were singing pleasant songs.
We were so excited that we climbed up to the top non-stop.
When we watched the total lunar eclipse, l we could not help cheering.
We had a good time that night.
So do I.
It was the saddest and happiest one in my life.
I missed them very much and I felt sad.
That night we had a good time together.
We bought many things to eat and played many games.
We sang and danced .
They knew me had strong homesick, so they tried to make me happy by telling a lot of jokes.
Then we hurried off the mountain to go to school.
Watching the changing moon on Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the most wonderful things while tasting delicious food.
Almost at the same time it became a NEW MOON again.
I was very excited at this.
At 8.
00 P. M, we lighted a lantern to keep the evil spirits away.
Though not staying with my family at that time, I felt at home because of such a enchanted night.
Last year, I became a college student.
Needless to say, I felt proud and delighted.
At the same time, I was also scared and a bit down --- I would have to live alone without my family.
As the Festival drew upon, I felt more upset.
"Who is it?
" I asked.
There was no answer.
I went out looking around, but could see nobody.
Puzzled, I turned back.
To my great surprise, my best friend, Xiaohui, was in the middle of the room.
She had travelled a long way to be with me.
" I will never forget that Mid-Autumn.
My most memorable Autumn Festival Night is the one that just passed.
Contrary, this day is so wonderful for me.
The beautiful moon was bright, and rose higher and higher.
Having enjoyed ourselves, we started walking back, and arrived at midnight.
August 15th, by Lunar Calendar, is the Chinese traditional festival.
As a rule, the whole family gets together for a happy night.
children were carrying lanterns for fun.
I had no mood in doing that thing.
Just at that moment I realized I was alone in a strange city.
Imagining the whole family sitting around the table happily, I felt a little upset.
I really missed them all.
Thinking the past time I spent with my former friends, I felt like visiting them.
On that night I could see the lunar eclipse so I would never forget it.
Later, the moon became darker.
I couldn't help crying, because they were so thoughtful and so kind.
That night we played till midnight, singing, dancing and talking.
That night was so pleasurable that I will keep it in my mind for ever.
Mid-Autumn Festival is a Chinese traditional festival.
On that night, children like to go out lighting?
It was so interesting that I was attracted.
I was frightened and threw away my lantern.
Certainly, it burnt.
Being unable to light a lantern, I returned home crying sadly.
Until my mother promised me to buy a more beautiful one for me the next year did I stop crying.
The Mid-Autumn Festival night of this year was my most memorable night .
What a beautiful night!
The full moon was hanging high up in the wide sky.
The breeze was blowing gently.
What a pity!
For me, it also was my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night.
Last year I entered South China Normal University.
It was my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night.
At that time, I had an impulse to cry, but, in the presence of my roommates and other people I tried my best to hold back my tears of sadness.
I can't forget the mid-Autumn Festival night of 1996.
Last year, I spent a special Mid-Autumn Festival night here.
The apples were large and red.
The moon was full and bright.
It gave me a special memory.
On that night I had a good time.
The moon was very round and bright and the sky was blue.
Our campus was full of laughter.
I was invited to a party with my friends.
The last Mid-Autumn Festival night was significant.
There as lunar eclipse in that night.
Before it appeared the lunar eclipse the earth was covered with silver.
The moon was so big, so bright that we could see the palace in it.
We even couldn't see each other.
After a while, the moon struggled to show itself out.
How fun the last Mid-Autumn Festival night was.
The most unforgettable thing we did in the party was burning firecrackers.
In a word, I will never forget that wonderful Mid-Autumn Festival night.
There was a little difference in this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, because I spent it with my room-mates in Guangzhou far away from myhometown.
That evening, we enjoyed the moon , singing songs and dancing.
On that night, I ate too much to eat anything else.
But this time is the special one, I spent it with my classmates instead.
At first, we just stayed at the dormitory eating some food.
About fifteen classmates took part in the games we planned.
Though the games were silly and not fashionable today, we all enjoyed ourselves.
The Mid-Autumn Festival night was different this year.
For the first time I spent this night at school.
It was my classmates who were going to have a party.
I joined them.
It was the most exciting part of the night.
We forgot he time.
it was almost midnight before we knew it.
It was a special and happy night.
I missed my family and felt lonely.
We held a happy party.
We played interesting games, such as charades and "two men three feet".
All of us had a good time.
Now, he is in charge of the moon.
You must be surprise.
Why is that?
" My cousin gave me one.
I was so excited that I ate it immediately.
She put some pepper in it.
After eating a little, my eyes and nose were running.
I didn't mind.
It was one of my family's games.
People usually have a warm welcome to the birth, while try their best to avoid death.
There is an old saying in China: debt is better than death.
People now put more emphasis on the quality of life than the merely quantity.
A comparable short, happy life is accepted by many people.
Most of old people don't have the fear for death as they did before.
Many people want to die with dignity and peace.
They don't want to experience a long waiting period before the death.
Modern medicine science can use various methods to maintain the painless of the death.
The unscrupulous persons will take advantage of it and dubbed the murder as "mercy killing".
We have to agree that this is the aspect we should pay attention to In this case, a good law should be introduced to protect the legal euthanasia.
We should ensure that the mercy killing is performed at the patient's request with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.
The doctors should have joint approval of all medical personnel attending so that to ensure the patient is really beyond hope.
We can even set up the institutions to supervise the practice.
At the same time, the education on death should be carried out.
Euthanasia should be legalized in China.
It has been considered in various levels, from different angles.
Thus people and society will get much more benefits than bad effects.
Except that what the war left us is just a memory full of violence and a deep thought --- people are still fighting for their country.
The Gulf War began on January 16, 1991.
It lasted for 42 days, including 38 days' air battle.
The war ended with the multinational army controlling South Kuwait and Iraq.
Tens of thousands of Iraqis were killed.
Human history is a long story of conquering and being conquered.
It is often very difficult to tell which side stands for justice.
Patriotism comes from love to one's mother.
Mothers give birth to their children and bring them up without any complaint.
Children's love to their mothers is a combination of gratitude, tenderness and faith.
Everyone has the intention of belonging to a certain community.
Nobody wants to be lonely.
It is miserable for people who have no motherland.
They hope to be accepted and protected.
We long for peace, or we fight for peace.
There is always contradiction between war and peace.
But one thing is clear: no one will be blamed because of fighting for his country.
On the other hand, wars are doubtlessly nightmares which have brought about countless tragedies.
Then how should we evaluate wars?
And is it still a great thing to fight for one's country?
Usually, it's the conflict between nations that brings out wars.
Wars also happen when a country means to conquer the other one such as the Gulf War.
Because war is the quickest way to span a country's territory and obtain large amount of wealth.
A war span varies from a few days to several decades, which depends on the purpose of a war, the military power of both sides and the interference of the third country.
Most People oppose war which they think may destroy the civilised world and cover man's history with humiliation.
But can we find another better way to solve so many disputes?
Some kinds of disputes can be solved according to laws.
Tom must submit to the law.
At a time, we were proud of the United Nations which was expected to keep the world in order.
But we are disappointed to see that UN's power is still very limited.
The worst thing is that UN was just a political card played by some country in a period.
Then, war turns out to be the only approach to end endless disputes.
Kuwait would have been diminished by evil Iraq in no time if it had refused to join the war.
For example, fighting, weapons have been developed greatly since war appeared.
Hence, Hi-tech has become a key point which can decide the final to a great extent.
Most people oppose war because they're afraid of war.
We can't always say war is unjust.
Because on the part of the defence country, war is just.
We call those national heroes who devoted their lives to the defense war and we erect monuments for them.
But we never do so for the dead on the unjust side.
A war doesn't always result in tragedies.
If the bad side is defeated, then the war has pushed the world a step forward.
Fortunately, most of wars ended with the victory of the just side.
It conforms with Mao Zedong's conclusion, "Victory always belongs to justice.
" War is the exterior form of the interior conflict.
Like any other things, war has two sides and no one can avoid it.
It won't disappear as long as human beings are living.
From their point of view, I got a conclusion that feminists are not only necessary but also imperative.
Thinking of feminists, many people would associate it with those extreme radicals, who advocated that females controlled the world and domineered over males.
There is no doubt that men and women are different.
In fact, every person is different from others.
If used properly every person could contribute to the society greatly.
No one or one kind of people is inferior to others.
Women are as intelligent and enterprising as men, evidences can be found all around the world.
It harms our whole beings.
After so many years and so many people's struggle, the condition of women has improved greatly.
However, in some area like Asia, the situation is not pessimistic.
Due to the religions and historical influence, women in China are still struggling for living.
It's women's legal rights to enjoy equality with men socially, politically and economically.
However, it's not totally true in reality.
Though China has been liberated for more than forty years, feudal idea still exists.
The Confucius's three cardinal principles are still obeyed by many Chinese especially those in rural areas.
To go to work and show yourself will be considered as immoral.
Their condition is simple: just five boys.
Naturally, the institute doesn't agree.
They want to make a bargain: How about three boys and two girls.
(By the way, the two girls' academic mark is much better than boys') The company turned down firmly: "Even if you give us four boys and one girl, we wouldn't accept.
The company's reason is quite straightforward: "Women are weaker both in body and in intelligence.
What's more, women will have birth and they'll have vacation.
It's uneconomic for us to employ girl students.
" I answered directly: "If we love each other.
" "What does that matter?
" She told me professionally: "Men should excel women.
(t9-3) 	Nowadays, women's status in many aspects has been elevated.
For centuries, the women's economic position was at the bottom of the heap.
The family economy depends on men.
For that, men thought that women must be very grateful to them.
Eventually, men had the sense of superiority, for "it is us to feed you.
you can't live on without us.
One can see how insignificant women's post is both in family and society because of their economic dependence.
"Walk out of the kitchen!
" is what feminists call for the women.
" 	In addition, it is not unusual that women's income is lower than men's.
In the social field.
Feminists demand that women must have the same chances as men of education, job, social activities, etc.
(t9-4) 	If you open Bible, you will read about the myth of Eva's creation from Adam's rib.
For centuries, Chinese women were confined in their fathers' and later their husbands' houses, taking care of domestic chores, seldom went out, not to mention working equally with men.
Women in Islamic countries have to wear long gowns and thick veil outside their houses.
Even today their education and profession aren't encouraged.
Women in Japan, Korea and Taiwan seldom go out to work even though lots of them have received university education.
Even in the modern society of the 20th century, unfair treatments of women are still very common.
Some people hold the false idea that girls are slower than boys in academic study and consider it a waste of money to send them to school, esp.
higher educational institutes.
The misunderstanding and discrimination of women even exist in universities and colleges.
When fewer women make the grade in academic life, their smaller numbers are taken to mean that they don't want to or are not capable of finishing complicated academic study.
Women have a harder time than men when they are into the job market.
Companies think women are troublesome for their long period of conception and child rearing.
Because of family pressure, women are usually not as active and ambitious as their men counter-parts in work.
As a result, there is a prevailing view in the society that women are home-oriented while men are career-oriented.
As to "not sufficiently deferential to men", the boss continued to explain, "You don't play second fiddle to your male co-anchors, you don't hide your intelligence to make the guys look smarter.
" In this case, the female anchor was unfairly paid.
Worse than that, she wasn't able to keep her job for she's too outstanding, too intelligent and she even took the leading role from men.
As a result, many women are kept at home, and many career women are treated unfairly.
The movement includes persuading, protesting and education, hoping to wake up human race from its false tradition, help them, esp.
women, to understand the essence of the status quo.
Enthusiasts of women's lib write articles, make statements to enlighten the masses, pointing out the unfairness.
In treating of women's role in the family, they hold that it is not correct to assume that women are better at detailed work simply because that is the work they customarily do.
While talking about women at jobs, they agree that differences exist between the two sexes, but these shouldn't be the reason to exclude women from well- paying jobs or keep them in inferior positions.
They are strongly for the equal status among all human beings, women and men.
Mainly, their points of views are correct and means, suitable.
Though there are some radical actions, they can't represent the whole.
Men are better estimating their old and new relations with women.
They go out of their home where they have been tied to for thousands of years.
They receive better education, have jobs and have more chances to see the world.
In a word, they are trying to act as an equal social force as men.
(t9-5) 	No longer was it possible to operate on the assumption that most women would spend the majority of their lives tending the home or taking care of children.
The social struggles of the feminist movement had clearly produced far-reaching and impressive gains.
Therefore, in my opinion, feminists have done more good to the cause of women than harm.
We can analyse the reasons from five aspects.
In the first place, political discourse and behaviour also reflected the impact of changing gender roles.
The distribution of women in jobs historically defined as exclusively male also showed substantial change.
Partly as an indication of all these social shifts, the family also changed dramatically.
The shifts in family composition also testified, at least in part, to "new rules" governing attitudes toward sex, self-fulfillment, and gender roles.
The standpoint indicates that the woman is not a plaything.
According to this, many governments begin to pay attention to the woman's position in work and try their best to decrease the sexual harassment.
Even in the army, American government will punish the man who does the sexual harassment to a woman.
They think it can improve human rights for everyone.
Many employers only like to use the beautiful women to attract the customers.
Sometimes it is effective, but if your quality is not good, you still will lose the customers.
The most emphasized and first demanded equality is about the job.
Therefore, what the feminists want is the equality that both women and men should stand on the fair ground of competition and that no discrimination should be exercised.
One is worsening sexual harassment in work places by their bosses.
Those who refuse will probably be fired or have no chance of promotion.
The other is the family violence.
Because the equality on other aspects such as economy and social role are embodied and consolidated by political right.
Apart from the above, feminists also appeal for other rights like abortion and lesbian.
These, are too extreme, because language is the result of remote history and are only signals.
Obviously women and men have still not been equal, women are still not liberated.
No wonder a crusade for women's right becomes more and more thriving.
For no matter how low the boys have got the marks they are the first choices to many companies.
What an unfair world!
Battered Women Shelter, which is mentioned at the very beginning, reveals another serious problem in our society.
Traditional custom which requires women to give up their careers and go back home taking care of the family while their husbands devote themselves into their careers, confines many women to their housework.
According to a book named "See U.S. from the University", we get to know that many female M.A.
Couples like Mr. and Mrs. Curie are not easy to be seen.
What a waste of such females' good brains!
From these, we can see that movement for women's rights is necessary for improving the females' social standards.
Governments should set up some laws about that.
But are they equal?
Absolutely not.
Yet someone said: "Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
" Is that true?
To answer this question, we'd better have a look at the situations now.
From newspapers, we heard from time to time about the cruel husbands and battered wives and all kinds of unfairness towards women.
Though the government has stressed many times that men and women are equals, and we often say "women are half of the world".
There are always people who just neglect all these.
This is the reality facing Chinese women and women in other countries as well.
Answering this need, Feminists appeared.
So what have they done?
Women's Liberation Movement emerged in 1960s.
It is not a long history.
Above all, they have waken up the consciousness of women in the world about the serious matter, and lead the struggle for a better world.
Now we can say "no" to the previous question.
I don't think this would do any good and situation wouldn't change because of this simple change of words.
We need more practical action rather than such formality.
In conclusion, Feminists have done more good than harm.
(t9-9) 	Feminism is no longer a new concept to people nowadays.
Advocators and fighters of feminism make every effort to realise women's equality with men, which is women's great ideal for centuries.
In most western counties, series of laws and regulations have been made and put forth to protect women's legal rights.
But if we turn to the rest of the world, the situation is quite different.
Have they ever thought or heard of feminism?
Personally I hope there is a day they'll become aware of this and try their best to change it.
In Japan and South Korea both of which have been deeply affected by Confucianism in social psychology, women's social estate is "traditionally" rather lower.
A rather popular saying may tell us something elusive: "Japanese women are the most submissive wives on the world".
Although feminism has been exerting its influence in the two countries, the achievement is little.
(t9-10) 	Do feminists and women benefit from feminism greatly?
Do they suffer from it?
And what is the specific definition of feminism?
That is why the feminism caused so many serious problems later.
This is the root.
As we all know, everything should have their own place for moving.
It is necessary to limit their own activities in the place and it is seldom allowed to go beyond.
For instance, army men should do things according to military rules; human beings should obey the law of nature, otherwise, they are punished.
Men and women are completely different.
It is impossible to win the equality between them in all fields.
I don't mean women should always follow men in every field.
As to the equality with men, the society has offered equal opportunity for both men and women.
In this condition, women and feminists should take effort in improving their own ability in order to contest with man.
In most cases, feminists don't do like that.
They just call on those women to quarrel with men for equality.
To those married female feminists, the most direct struggling action is to ask for equal rights in family.
I don't know why all these things developed so quickly since then.
Why don't those Islam countries have these problems?
It is because the women in these countries just do women's own things.
They are in their legal scope.
All in all, feminists should take effort in improving women's own ability so that they can enlarge their legal scope gradually.
(t9-11) 	"Should men and women be equal?
" This is a question much discussed by people all over the world today.
Many say that men and women should not be regarded as equal, because many things men do could not be done by women.
They say that men have always shouldered the responsibility of protecting women, therefore men are stronger than women and should have more right than women.
From a certain point of view, these remarks may sound reasonable.
Women are playing an increasingly important role in society today.
Having repeatedly demonstrated ability in roles traditionally held by men, they are showing just how much they can contribute.
No longer can it be said that women's place is only in the home raising children and keeping house.
But some say that it's the women's liberation that makes women's situation worse.
They argue that it is too much for women to work full-time outside the home and take care of home as well.
As a matter of fact, this argument is groundless at all.
With the changes in their social role, women's position in the family has been improved as well.
The wife no longer is obedient to her husband but, instead, exerts an influence on the children and family affairs equal to that of the husband.
The idea of a man doing all the housework was little thought of as laughable.
There is a revolution in sex-roles.
In this case, we say, working outside while taking care of the family, the wife benefits a lot.
Firstly, the wife is independent economically.
She'll be subject to nobody.
Thirdly, if she just stays at home to do house work and take care of her children, she'll gradually feel life is so dull that she'll be tired of it.
Occasionally, she'll be in a bad mood, which is not good for the family.
(t9-12) 	A famous Chinese saying "Women can hold up half of the sky" can mostly portray the situation of Chinese women in present days.
Before 1949, women were at the bottom of the society.
Discrimination can be reflected from many aspects.
In a man-chauvinist country like old China, women could not keep their own names at the moment they were married.
During the four decades after liberation, China has seen conspicuous improvement in women's social status.
The constitution stipulated that women should gain equal job opportunity as men.
Most urban families, consequently, have the wives as one of their bread-earners.
The history has ceased of Chinese women wearing their husband's family names before their own.
Chinese husbands can be attributed to this great success for their lenience and kindness.
Most Chinese husbands don't feel ashamed of the nickname.
Why should they?
What is undeniable, however, is that China is the country that makes the greatest accomplishment in women affairs and the whole world recognizes it with the honor of the 1st World Women's Conference being held in this country in 1995.
(t9-13) 	What should a woman look like?
But this has been severely criticised by feminists who strongly advocate that women shouldn't be confined to housework and they have the right to work as men do.
To some extent, they do help women gain some equality, especially in China where women have been fettered by the feudal tradition of the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues for so many years.
But in my opinion, generally they have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
Although most women are still clinging to traditionally feminine jobs such as nursing, teaching and office work, some pioneers have ventured into new fields which used to be men's patent.
They run business, become astronauts, lawyers and take up politics.
The tide of working women seems to sweep the world.
" Women's new role in the society has created some striking effects on both the society and the family.
As a result, today's women tend to marry later.
Their devotion to their career results in the decline of birthrate.
Perhaps this is welcome in some developing countries with overpopulation, but it poses a threat to some western-European countries whose population is too small to coincide with its rapid pace of economic development.
In the second place, women's new role touches their family life.
The most direct victims are their children.
They spend most of their time not with their parents but with baby-sitters and teachers in the kindergartens.
Due to the lack of motherly love, they tend to have an uncommunicative and eccentric disposition.
For the working mothers have to devote themselves to their work, they can spare little time to take care of their children.
Consequently, their children drift apart from them.
Some working mothers make a success in their career, which does give them pride and self-confidence, but also makes them "guilty" towards their children.
Owing to the long-time lack of communication, the children no longer tell their secrets first to their mothers, nor act like a spoiled child in front of their mothers.
All of these deeply hurt the working mothers.
They always try to make some compensation.
Some of them have to take up a double career --- both as a working woman and as a housewife.
Every day, they're kept constantly on the run between their home and office.
Endless social activities and the drudgery of housework almost become the main content of their life.
They are tired of the inflexible life but they have to put up with it because they want to be both a qualified career woman and a qualified mother.
However, they're deficient in energy.
They feel a heavy burden, which makes them at the edge of collapse.
They're exhausted both mentally and physically.
So, working women do have gained self-confidence and independence, but haven't gained real happiness.
Thirdly, women's new role has a bad influence on the relationship between wife and husband.
It must be admitted that more and more husbands are willing to share housework with their wives.
But we must realise the deep- rooted tradition that the housework is mainly under the charge of women.
So, most men only accept the theory of sharing chores with their wives, but they don't put it into practice.
They have got used to being greeted by their wives when they come home and being served the delicious meal when they sit at the table.
When their wives take a career, all have changed.
The two points become the main reasons for the increase of divorce rate.
Usually it is the wife who hurts most because women are more fragile in sentiment (we cannot deny women's nature).
The last point I'd like to mention is that feminists' view of women's complete equality to men is unpractical.
The physical differences between women and men determine that women can't be qualified with any career that attracts them.
If a weak woman insists on doing the job of carrying luggage at station just as the man does, it will only ruin her.
It's pointless to compete with men in this aspect.
It's a fact that women often meet great difficulties on their way to the success of their careers which are beyond their traditional ones.
The factor of themselves and the factor of the society have both prevented them from reaching the top.
Nowadays, working women see themselves in a new light.
They've realised their own value.
But for women, taking a career involves sacrifice --- either their family harmony or their physical health.
However, most of the working women are bearing a heavy burden --- the double career (home and office).
(t9-14) 	Men and women compose a wonderful world and the relationship between them remains changing throughout the history.
In the ancient matriarchal society, women dominated the society.
It's a great challenge to the traditional concept and it made women re-consider how to carry out their self-value in the society.
As a result, many women return to the colourful society and become career women.
Some say that it has done more harm than good to the cause of women.
Yet I'm afraid I can't agree with that.
Women should go out to the society as men do.
First, what on earth is the cause of women?
Of course, family is a great cause to women, yet it's far from enough.
Besides taking good care of her husband and kids, a woman should also try her hand in society --- take a job.
Everyone is born equal, so women and men should have the same right, the same freedom to choose one's own cause.
Admittedly, there does exist difference between men and women, yet it doesn't matter.
Since there are divisions of labour, people should cooperate with each other.
As long as people take the job which suits them, it's O.K.
And only when women go out to the society can they have enough chance to realize their value, to exert their ability fully.
If you come to China and have a look, you will find that this worry is groundless.
Most women in China have a job as her husband does and they also have a happy family, lovely kids.
To go out to the society is not only good for women themselves, it can strengthen the linking between husband and wife as well.
Even worse, she will be out of keeping with society because of her lack of contact with it.
She will have no idea of what's going on except the price in the market.
Then gradually, the husband and wife haven't much common language, and the link between them will break.
In reality, it's also impossible for all the women to stay at home.
So what about encouraging the women to go out to the society and make the world more colourful?
(t9-15) 	Feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In my opinion, it goes the other way round.
Since the women liberation, women have raised their social status.
Women have obtained more freedom.
Women are more confident than ever.
In short, feminists speak out for women, hence, women can have as equal chances as men.
The duty of women was to wait on men, attend to family chores and care for children.
It is, of course, totally unfair.
Women possess their unique merits.
They are fit for a large number of jobs.
They certainly can support themselves and even compete with men openly and fairly.
Feminists stand out and call on their sisters to strive for their own rights.
They stir their sisters' sleeping consciousness in order to help them out of men's domination.
Women are not born to be confined to a family.
They infuse the active power into the original men-dominating world and thus promote the development of the society in all aspects.
As women enter the outside world, the competition becomes more and more fierce.
However, women should not be misled in the process of self-support.
There exists sexual discrimination in the division of jobs.
Most of these jobs are regarded as unimportant by men.
Therefore, that women go out to work does not necessarily mean women have equal opportunities.
Meanwhile, women should not be blind to see their own limitedness.
They must act in accordance with their existing and potential abilities.
Although women can do more jobs than housework, they are not supposed to do all kinds of jobs.
Husbands may not value their wives very much and tend to have affairs with other women.
As years go by, women sacrifice their youth and beauty.
They take pride in, if any, only their husbands or children.
However, their husbands or children will do better jobs than they will if they support them.
All in all, whenever possible, women ought not to hide in the shadows of men.
They have all reasons to struggle against the oppression and discrimination of men.
Women don't have to submit to men.
Women are free to choose to do what they like or what they are fit for.
As Chinese say, women can hold up half the sky.
Then, what are the consequences after continuous devastating destruction of nature?
Human beings sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.
In some urban cities and developing areas since pollutants discharged surpass the ability of natural purification, these places become unsuitable ones for people to live in.
Noise pollution and atmosphere and water pollution are the major problems.
People also suffer from the acid rain.
Manmade intervention also disrupts the ecological balance.
In addition, we lost something precious that we can not obtain forever.
It is reported that some materials in the tropical forest, which are the elements of medicine against cancer, Aids or other dangerous diseases disappear because of the deforestation.
Fortunately, humanity is finally aware of and face the degenerating environment.
Various conferences on environmental protection were held.
Laws on pollution control have been established.
Some countries commence to concern about the endangered species and publish laws and regulations to ban illegal wildlife trade and set up natural reserve.
This situation is urgently calling for improvement.
They have to achieve higher marks than boys so as to attract attention.
Concerning work, women have made greater efforts to get the jobs.
The unfair payment surely dampens women's enthusiasm for their professions, on the other hand, it encourages men's arrogance and unconscientiousness.
The depression of those enterprising women?
The satisfaction of the incapable men?
They are considered as personal property of men.
Through efforts, women gained the right to hold the first women sports games in 1993.
But, ridiculously, no men were allowed to watch any match in it, because the women had exposed their bodies.
Only because their long neck is considered to be elegant, women have to torture themselves to please the men.
Women have no identity at all in many places.
They are only accessories of men.
The situation has to be changed.
Women should stand up to fight for themselves if god doesn't bless them.
Feminists are pioneers in this move.
(t9-1) 	I don't think feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In the past, women were universally looked down upon by men.
The man was the master of the house.
He should be respected and listened to by his wife.
Women were considered housewives more than anything else.
They were expected to stay at home, rear children and take care of the house.
With regard to the children, boys were always cherished in a family.
Girls could not do the same thing as boys did.
They had no right to go to school, to go out and play with other boys and to do what they wanted.
All they were permitted to do was to sit at home and to do some sewing.
What a pitiful life they lived!
The majority of women receive good education.
They are doing what they like: taking up advertising, furnishing or interior decoration, studying science, medicine or law, etc.
All these prove that women are obviously not inferior to men in their working ability.
They make friends with both sexes without feeling uneasy or embarrassed.
On the whole, they have more freedom to choose what they like to do.
To draw the conclusion, I think that both sexes should regard each other as equals.
In fact, women have a lot of potentials.
In this aspect, feminists have played an important role.
(t9-2) 	I don't think this opinion is right.
In countries like China and Japan, the males were much respected by the females.
Many people also have the old-fashioned idea that a married woman should stay at home to look after the house and that her education and knowledge should be a heritage for her children in later years.
Most women nowadays are able to be independent of a living.
We can find women working with men in some fields of occupation, distinguish themselves by their ability, efficiency and cautiousness.
In fact, they do good to women.
Through their persistent struggle, women though not exactly above men in everything, are almost parallel to men in their social life as well as in their profession.
Women work side by side with men and some of them even hold higher position than men do.
(t9-3) 	We are told according to the history book that long time ago there used to be a society in which men and women were cooperative and both sexes were living in peace.
Unfortunately, feminists have been mistaking "equal rights" for "equal power", consequently they have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
One fact is that the word "superpower woman" ("nu qiang ren") has come into being.
What is a "superpower woman"?
Maybe this example is not quite proper.
An ideal society is one in which both sexes cooperate, help each other and live in harmony.
To strive for such a society.
we should not go beyond the proper limits in correcting an error.
What we should do is to establish a new world in which women cooperate with men but not dominate men or do everything bad that men do.
(t9-4) 	In 1880, seeing her husband come into her bedroom, the honored empress had to kneel down before the emperor, calling herself *"his slave.
**" In 1980, women walked with their husbands hand in hand, happiness shown on their faces.
This great change would not have taken place without the persistent efforts of feminists.
It was feminists who realized that the inequality between the two sexes were unjust and made other women conscious of their situation.
Through lectures, advertisements and brochures, they call on women to struggle for their rights they deserve.
It has been very hard because most men, accustomed to their predominance in the society, are strongly against the feminists.
Their efforts have brought positive results.
By doing so women are more independent than their ancestors and therefore more confident and happier than before.
By having jobs, women share men's great burden.
All this could not have been achieved without feminists.
Feminists are continuing their efforts, trying to change some tokenism to real equality.
I hope they will get more support from the society.
(t9-1) 	According to the dictionary feminism is the belief that woman should have the same rights, power, and opportunities as men.
Feminists are those who believe in and support feminism.
In my opinion feminists have done much good to the cause of women.
Feminism helps to promote women's position both in society and family.
As far as women's social status is concerned, nowadays there are quite a large number of female politicians, scientists, professors, doctors, etc.
Women have almost entered every field of work.
Politically speaking women have the same right to vote and be elected as men.
Thatcher is a good example.
Economically speaking women are able to earn as much money as men.
In the current of reforming women take up doing business as well as men and some get quite rich.
It is no longer true that making money is men's task.
Women can do the same.
In addition girls can do as well as boys in school.
Many teachers have noticed the phenomenon that in the early years of education girls averagely tend to receive higher marks than boys.
This provides strong evidence for the idea that women and men are mentally equal though they cannot be physically equal.
We have to admit that men are stronger than women with regard to physical strength.
But this difference does not exist in the aspect of mental ability.
Many girls get their MA or doctor's degree as well.
Since in so many aspects women's ability is the same as men's, why should not women get the same rights and opportunities as men?
Before women were liberated from the traditional view that women are born family caretakers, they were bound to their children, husbands, and families.
They did housework all day long.
No opportunity was provided for them to participate in social activities.
Under such conditions how can women show their talent?
We can be sure to say that many talented women lost the opportunity to become somebody.
In this sense feminists have done much good to the cause of women because their belief contributes to the establishment of women's self-confidence and self-respect.
Because of feminism women can have their own cause for which they exert themselves.
Once offered the same opportunities as men, women are able to compete with men and even surpass them in some aspects.
One reason may be that women are apt to love students due to their experience of looking after their own children.
They may like to be with children to help them grow healthily, and to impart knowledge.
Being a woman she possesses particular qualities that can never be found in a man.
So it is unfair to say that women are inferior to men.
Since all men are created equal, women should have the same rights, power, and opportunities as men.
What feminists have done is greatly helpful to the cause of women.
No one can disregard the achievement of feminism in discovering women's ingenuity for the society's use.
We must accept the difference between the men and the women.
We must deal with the view of feminists correctly.
(t9-3) 	Feminists could have appeared with the development of the society.
They stuck firmly to the feminism, the principle that women should have the same rights and chances as men.
We could say its original meanings and aims were good.
But actually, feminists have gone to extremes to exaggerate the women's status nowadays, so it's not surprising that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
Why should we think so?
It's the same situation to the human being.
At last, what's the true meaning of the cause of women' after all?
Feminists usually limit its meaning to the liberation of women.
Men couldn't be pregnant.
This is only my personal opinion, do you agree with me?
So in most countries the role of women is changing.
However, they still run up against some roadblocks since many government jobs are closed to them, and certain jobs are not considered honorable for women.
In general, they feel they are more liberated now and have an alternative to their old way of life.
In some countries, such as Russia, over half the doctors are women, over 30 percent of the engineers are women, practically all the teachers are women, and women comprise over half the university students.
But, the majority of manual laborers in Russia are women.
In fact four-fifths of Russia's working women are engaged in physical labor.
As in most countries, women predominate in the lowest paying professions.
In some ways, Chinese women are rewarded for their hard work.
They can rise to positions of prestige more easily than elsewhere.
But the thing is not so good.
Every day, after their working, women can't have a rest like men.
In fact, women do the double of work.
It is not real equality.
This result will cause the disintegration of the family unit.
In 1970s came finally the women's movement.
The aim of the women's movement is to overcome the legal, economic, and other inequalities that have been termed institutionalized sexism.
It's not surprising that these women are highly sensitive to attitudes and practices which try to limit women's work roles.
As societies become more technologically advanced, sex roles change gradually, despite institutionalized sexism.
Even in some traditionally male-dominated societies, women are moving toward equality.
These aims also require changes in the traditional family structure.
Feminists believe that man should play a large role in housework and child care.
Feminists are trying to change certain cultural myths as well.
Two of these concern working women.
The first is that working women are not as happy as housewives.
However, the young working women have slightly greater marital stability than those without jobs.
Now women are not only housewives, they can also work as men, they have their own independent lives.
(t9-7) 	With the progress of society, women have taken an important role in many areas.
Although wearing tradition clothing and staying at home used to be the rule, today many women are going into professions, such as medicine, law and engineering.
They have their own home, they have to do housework and take care of children, this is a heavy burden.
I think our educated gentlemen could treat women equally in today's life.
The government should offer some work which is easier for them to do.
The women will have much time enjoying their happy life.
In fact, feminists have done more harm to the women, whether in their work or in their daily-life.
So women hadn't right in any way.
So the women now do double of the work.
(t9-9) 	Firstly, I have to say that I can not agree with the given title.
I believe feminists must have already done something beneficial to the cause of women.
If not, why will the fourth world women's conference be held next year?
We can find support from the 38th meeting held from March 7th to 18th by the United Nations' women's status committee.
The preparatory meeting discussed the draft of 'the programme of action', and the detailed rules of procedure.
Deputy secretary-general of UN Desay said, the development level of a society can be measured by its women's position.
It must be changed that men dominate organs of power and wield the power procedure.
Yet in many countries now, the number of women leaders in governments, big enterprises and parliaments is reducing.
Even in the United Nations, the percentage of women at policy making positions is only 13%, far less than 25%, the target percentage to be reached by 1995.
They pointed out that elimination of poverty is the question which claims precedence over all others.
And women should be taught to read, and enjoy health care, including birth control.
The problem of elimination of violence exists in developed countries as well.
If a peaceful environment without violence can not be ensured for women, all the efforts promoting equality and development will turn out to be futile.
how can someone say feminists bring more harm to women than good?
(t9-10) 	In the Bible, it is stated that everybody is equal before the God, no matter how poor or rich he/she is, no matter how strong or week he/she is.
Accordingly, "All men are equal" as it is said by George Orwell, thereby, everybody in the world has the right to live, to be educated and to defend himself/herself, and disabled persons are treated equally as normal people, they can live and enjoy themselves as anyone else.
In a multi-nationality country, minorities are always looked down upon, and fewer chances of employment, as well as poorer education are supplied to those minorities.
In the United States, the laws have admitted the equality between peoples of different colors.
In the world, many people in Africa are going hungry, sometimes even suffering from starvation, but some people in other continents are enjoying themselves without taking money into consideration.
(b2w-t9-1) I am not in favor of this idea totally.
As we all know, women's position was very low in the past.
They were inferior to men.
After husbands died, they must depend on their male children.
So women's fate was tightly connected with men's fate.
Or they would be considered dissipated.
There were so many codes of ethics that women should follow that women's potentiality couldn't be brought into full play.
God creates women and men to develop society together.
Without women's efforts, productive forces couldn't be promoted very quickly.
Women are more intuitive than men.
In addition, once women go outside to work, they are economically independent, which makes them break away from men's control.
They are never men's accessories again.
Feminists help women to gain more and more rights.
In China they can go to college; they have the vote right; they are entitled to be paid equally for equal work.
That was unthinkable in the old China.
Now when you enjoy Olympic Games, do you know that women were forbidden to participate in it in the beginning?
Someone may say, "If parents all go to work, no one will take care of children.
" Yes, perhaps parents can't spend more time caring about children.
But mothers don't reduce their love to children.
And children also need paternal love.
Isn't it a good thing?
Anything, only if it fits the development of history, can survive in society.
(b2w-t9-2) Since the 1960s, feminism has improved women's life in many respects.
It has been encouraging them to work more diligently, to tap their potential, to make them become more aware of their own existence.
Feminism has also affected men's life in many respects.
It shakes the absolutely dominant position of men.
Their wives who used to be docile are no longer obedient.
Men find their power weakening.
Of course they feel a sense of crisis.
Some women are totally independent.
They think they can manage their life without men's help.
Husbands, children are not their business.
They live by themselves and they like this way of life.
They lose themselves in the light of men.
Their roles in the society are only husbands' wives and sons' mothers.
They live on their husbands just like vines crawling on the trees.
I think this is their own choice which other people shouldn't put their fingers in, though I personally don't like the two kinds of life.
They are too radical.
In my opinion, the true meaning of feminism is: It is really very important for a woman to keep a kind of intimate, friendly and deep relationship with a man, but such relationship shouldn't be all she wants.
There are many other important things to do.
Feminism is aimed to help women develop themselves, help them become confident of themselves as independent human beings, to help them get the most benefit from their career, from social and individual life.
Are they afraid of it?
Actually feminism liberates both men and women.
When a woman can take care of herself, she has lessened the man's heavy burden.
If they both work hard, both support the family, both look after the children, the burden will be halved.
If they share the joy, the joy will be doubled; if they share the sorrow, the sorrow will be halved.
Feminism is misunderstood and misinterpreted by some people.
(b2w-t9-3) What is woman?
This is a question even more puzzling than Sphinx's riddle.
Nevertheless, some men and many women who may be called feminists, stick to their own philosophies.
More credit should be given to the feminists.
"New woman " came to be used in the popular press and widely spread.
As time goes by, feminists never stop their pursuit of full equality for women.
Socialists are usually feminists or the supporters of the feminism, because they believe a cooperative society would show respect to the right of women, so in China, women are supposed to hold up the half of the sky.
Since nothing is perfect, feminism itself certainly has some troubles to deal with.
Was it expressed in the way that all the difference between man and woman has to be abolished?
To sum up all of these, women like men have to think of one question first that is, "What is woman?
Anyway, we are the world, we can do without the opposite sex, neither man nor woman.
(b2w-t9-4) In recent years, feminism has achieved many of its goals.
Women began to be treated in a really equal way.
Still, there are many negative opinions, one of which is that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
Society comes to recognize the claims of women's rights equal to those possessed by men.
In the fields which used to be regarded as man's privilege, women are making contribution not less than men.
It was impossible in China a century ago that a woman had the right to refuse the marriage imposed on her by her parents, that she could refuse to become a life-long widow if her husband died without society's condemnation.
This right was possessed only by men in old times.
Women's legal rights have been claimed after centuries of oppression from religious dogmas.
The same is the case of feminism.
The history of feminism is a history of struggling and overcoming unfavorable conditions.
Every step they take is surely confronted with strong objections, which will certainly bring difficulty to the cause of women.
It is not out of expectation.
For instance, feminists' effort has gained much job opportunities for women, but new problems arise.
They are now almost free from chores, but the old relationship with their family has to be changed or even destroyed, which doesn't mean happiness at all.
Furthermore, in some cases, because of prejudice, women are treated even more unfairly.
All that has been written shows the unfavorable conditions of feminism, but they are temporary.
In addition, the achievement of feminists is also a plausible proof of their contribution to the cause of women.
(b2w-t9-5) Feminists have played an important role in promoting the social status of women.
But today, their activities have been bringing damages to the cause of women.
As we know, many jobs can be done better by man than by woman.
It doesn't mean any difference in social status, but in social division.
If any woman assumes that the jobs dominated by men show high social status, she can try to do it.
If she can't do it well, she should not have any complaint.
What they think about influences a great deal in women's mind.
So many women don't do the work they are fit for while taking the job they can't necessarily do well.
Second, feminists think that women's rights should be specially protected.
They set up many organizations in the name of protecting women's rights.
Actually, it is redundant to do so.
It is known to all that people are equally protected by law, regardless of man or woman.
As for casual violation of women's rights, women can resort to the law.
So, we can safely say that women are enjoying equal rights today.
Is there anyone who wants to see such a matter?
Definitely not.
On the whole, it's needless to specially advocate the protection of Women's rights today.
It will be better for women's cause if feminists stop appealing for women's equal rights which are actually equal.
Two hundred years later, people all over the world still struggle for equality.
Firstly, to some extent, it appears that all men are equal.
Human beings, male or female, tall or short, plump or slim, beautiful or ugly, clever or stupid, are equal.
Not a single person can escape from death.
Not a single person can live without air.
Not a single person can fly to Mars without a space shuttle.
All of us have the desire for eating and drinking.
However, we are not exactly the same.
In addition, we have a lot of differences.
That is to say, we are not equal all the time.
Inequality comes from everywhere.
Although we must die at last, some people were cut off in the prime of their youth, while others lived to over one hundred.
Although you worked much harder than your boss, you suffered from poverty while he continued to lavish with money.
You will not deny the facts above.
When thousands of ordinary people were in danger because of disaster, war and threat of violence, President Clinton stayed comfortably in the White House, with hundreds of bodyguards around him.
Furthermore, not Clinton but the state was to pay this bill.
Racial discrimination is proved to be the most suitable illustration to demonstrate the problem of inequality.
They don't have as many equal rights as white people do.
They have been tortured; they have been looked down upon; they have been driven from the schools.
(t10-2) Despite the saying: "All men are created equal", no absolute equality exists among human beings, whether in China or in other countries.
Power corruption is a worldwide problem.
Those in power exchange it for money or convenience.
In a seaside city of China, the ex-mayor was so powerful that no one dared to accuse him of power abusing.
He owned a beautiful modern house and had a huge bank account.
His salary couldn't provide him with these things.
The money, of course, came from back-door or other improper means.
His two sons both engaged in smuggling.
They were the privileged class.
Only when their father fell out of power were they arrested.
It was reported that of the smuggling cases, at least 50% involved the government organizations, state-owned companies or even China's foreign offices abroad.
In some cases, the public fund was used to smuggle.
Things are no better abroad.
Political scandals --- mostly the exchange of power for money or the other way around, are so common in Japan that its people lose confidence in the government.
Nothing can illustrate "some people are more equal than others" better than the American presidential election.
The US constitution declares that every citizen has the right to vote and be voted.
The truth is, unless one has strong financial support, he can never hope to be voted.
For a common US citizen, he has to work at least 10 years for a house of his own.
Then he raises a family and lives from hand to mouth.
There is no fair play.
"This is understandable", someone said, "otherwise, what's the use of money and power?
Share it with the public?
Work for it?
Almost impossible!
" The same is with education.
If one has enough money, he can buy himself an education.
Diplomats stationed in other countries enjoy a special right: They can commit crimes without being punished.
In fact, the same goes for almost every field of life, in the past or at present, here and abroad.
George Orwell summarized it: All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
(t10-3) "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others".
This shocking slogan comes from Animal Farm and it is a typical black humor.
I cannot help being stunned by their intelligence, they are skillful language-users and can express their ideas in a way beyond our imagination.
I, like the rest of the world, am so naive that I only know "unequal" before I come across "more equal".
"Let's fight for justice" --- it's right, we are born equal, we are endowed with the rights to fight for the rights we deserve.
So people all over the world stood up to support it, they sent all they had to help it: their food, clothes, medicine, even their husbands and sons.
And they at last brought it to the sunlit path of equality.
But we just cannot forget it.
I don't know if we can say "more corrupt", but surely some are corrupt enough to be called "more corrupt" if we have this usage.
Otherwise the people will overturn it.
We have officials in the government in order to control and promote the country, improve people's living standards, not to exploit people.
We have realized it and have done something.
But what remains before us is still a long road.
In that case he'd better go into the basement to have his own special right of enjoying darkness.
We are all children of God.
We are brothers and sisters.
But, more than two decades have now passed, and I am forced to say that mankind is still lumbering on its way to the paradise of equality.
The book recounts the ups and downs of an animal farm where rebellion finally broke out when the high-pressure rule of the animal king was unbearable.
But the animals did not enjoy the expected peace and happiness after they turned over the king because the new king, one used to be among them, turned out to be even more domineering.
It is easy to draw something common to mankind from this story.
It is impossible for human beings to be equal with each other insofar as personal interest and wealth, together with social status are concerned.
Our world is a material one, but it cannot afford to guarantee equal treatment to every person.
Wealth rains down on the rich; power attaches to the bigwigs; respect goes to the noblemen.
This seems to be the constant scheme of human life.
Can it be possibly altered?
The answer is no as long as someone sits on the very top of a humble group brandishing his symbolic cane.
The answer will never be yes unless the world drips with abundant wealth and opportunity for everyone's demand.
Every nation has been striving for a more secure and prosperous vista.
In the course of developing economy and building up strength, nations on the earth and people of these nations should bear in mind the age-old desire for equality which is still languishing for full blossom one day.
But for the time being, a material prosperity throughout the world, which is one of the essential basis for valid equality, has not yet appeared.
Let's pray for those suffering.
Later, the constitution was promulgated, providing that all citizens are equal.
What on earth makes the Chinese unequal?
Power and money.
Quite a number of Party members and leaders ignore the party discipline and the law of the state.
Their families and relatives can also enjoy many privileges.
It's very easy for them to enter some good institute or state-run company.
Most of them are not needed at all.
All this trouble was taken to please some leaders.
Perhaps there will be real equality in the communist society?
(t10-6) The famous word of "All men are equal, some are more equal than others" is really an alternative way to say "not all the men are equal".
It is very true today if we cast our eyes on the society we are living in.
When God decided to create human being, he created inequality in advance.
He intentionally made them into different colors.
So we have white, yellow, black, brown peoples.
Then he even unfairly and unreasonably put them to different circumstances, providing the whites with the fertile plains, favourable climate, fat sheep and horses and rich natural resources and the blacks with barren deserts and a harsh living condition.
This is the inequality in Nature, it is not directed by any human's will.
This time, the God is far beyond reproach.
So we have Martin Luther King's influential nation-wide boycott asking for equal rights in 1960s.
To say nothing of these so-called less democratic nations.
Let's look at the condition in Somali, a country which is almost destroyed by hunger and wars.
Its people are starving to death.
These people are even deprived of the most fundamental right of a person --- the right of life, how can they be equal to others?
It is no doubt that every democratic government declares in their constitution "All men should be equal.
Every society has its privileged class which is made up of a number of big fish.
They usually get more economic opportunities and political advantages which can not be obtained by every common countryman.
Not surprisingly, there out of the ten are the children of Mr Suhato, the nation's president.
But I would not doubt that they were less likely to be as they are now if they didn't have any strong support behind.
So no matter in what society, the absolute equality is impossible.
Maybe the beautiful dream of "All men are equal" is always a distant destination for us to strive for.
More significantly, they destroyed the board on which "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" was written.
One can find many examples in history: The American in the Independence War, the Negroes in the Civil War and the oppressed and exploited Chinese in the Liberation War all fought bravely and hard to win their equal rights.
For even today, "all men are equal" remains a hope.
They take advantage of the power they seized or given to them by people.
So, it produces an unequal scene: some men are above others.
Such a condition easily leads to corruption which is existing among any government.
Let's have Japan as an example.
Look at those millionaires, who can go from the U.S. to Swiss to have a holiday while ordinary workers are working hard to make a living.
If they are in the mood, they can buy all the tickets of an amusement park for one night and enjoy themselves madly, just like the popular singer Mickle Jackson, which may deprive so many others of their happiness of playing in that park that night.
In some places, enough money enables you to do whatever you like, including even committing crimes without punishment.
Martin L King's dream hasn't fully realized.
A world in which all men are equal remains a dream in everybody's heart.
When will it become true?
" This is a famous saying from the film "Animals' Farm".
Till now, the condition this sentence described is still commonly seen around the world.
Perhaps we can learn something from it.
" These words have also inspired a lot of people to fight for their equal rights, like the American Revolution, the Civil War, the two world wars.
Indeed the democracy has thus been pushed forward greatly.
For example, the law stipulated that everyone could elect or be elected.
But the fact is that only the millionaires or politicians supported by powerful financial groups can afford the amazingly high expense of election.
They indulge in luxury and extravagance all day and all night.
In contrast with this, a large number of poor people are on the edge of starvation.
In addition, the blacks and the whites are not equal, either.
Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem.
Although they have fought for over 200 years, their miserable fates haven't any change.
They are forbidden to enter the door of great opportunities and therefore can only do the dirtiest, hardest job.
Some day, I'm sure, the volcano of anger of these blacks, who have been kept at the bottom of the society, will explode.
Now, our social legal system isn't strong enough.
Sometimes some leader's words are the law.
If the leaders' children break the law, they can easily escape the punishment freely.
So it's necessary for us to change this unfair situation.
Secondly, the media and the public should supervise and expose the repulsive deeds of the officials as soon as possible.
(t10-9) In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others".
As far as I see it, this statement is still perfectly true in the present world.
Consequently, they cannot enjoy equal rights both in material and in democracy.
It is obvious to say that people are not equal in wealth.
If a rich person is accused of a certain crime, firstly he is able to afford the usually high bail and to wait for the trial outside prison.
However, a poor person may not be so lucky.
His empty pocket may even put his life to an end as well.
There is no need to mention how many rich people bribe or threaten witnesses, so far we can see that the rich and the poor are not equal.
Then, let us look at what happen between civilians and government officials.
Once mankind has power to administer others, he will abuse it more or less without doubt.
Corruption and accepting bribes are common practice throughout the world.
Certainly there are impartial officials as well.
However, this is only one of the most distinctive examples from numerous acts of racial discrimination in various ways.
Many white people seem still to be unable to reject the idea of despising people of another colour totally because of traditional, cultural and economic reasons.
What is the situation today?
Have all the people got equality?
If these questions were raised fifty years ago, you could easily find the answer from a newly-published novel named Animal Farm, written by a Russian writer.
In the novel it said "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.
To me, I will say yes.
Here I am not denying that in each country of the world more and more people have got their equality, and great progress has been made in the equality of man.
But it is still not enough.
The rich is becoming richer, and the poor is becoming poorer.
In real life, they are not equal at all.
One is formed by the group of people who have power in hand.
In other words, it is formed by officials.
The other stratum, of course, is formed by civilians.
Power is a kind of commodity between the officials.
The last one is the main cause of the racial discrimination, which is becoming a great obstacle for mankind to reach the hill-top of the equality of man.
In a same nation, they cannot have the same right like other dominating races have.
It's a famous cartoon reflecting the political situation of the former Soviet Union during its communist revolution time in 1917.
" And for all the cartoon's artistic exaggeration and fabrication, this sentence is true and still effective in today's world.
However, it does not stop here.
Compared with these "rich people", the teachers, intellectuals and workers are simply leading a "miserable" life which is carefully budgeted only to have both ends meet.
Three hundred years have gone now since we dedicated to that proposition.
Can we boast of our feat and engage in the luxury of cooling off, thinking that we will get our final success soon?
No!
Man is far away from his most beautiful goal --- real and complete equality.
Fortunately, in this equal world some men are rich and some are poor.
So we have the comfortable country villa with the shabby cabin in the ghetto.
So we have tender beefsteak and black bread.
Their promotions are more difficult and rarer compared with the males.
"All men are equal" is a dream for us to try to realise.
" I think this is still true today.
Let's not discuss the racial discrimination existing in some countries for the present.
We just take a common social phenomenon as an example.
It can be said as a world-wide phenomenon.
One is the men who possess authority.
Most of them hold an important post or a lucrative post.
The other kind is the rich men.
Though they haven't authority like the former one, as they have money, they can share the privilege as well.
As they have money, they can solve sticky questions under the help of expensive gifts.
(t10-14) In George Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote that "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" Scores of years have passed since then, however, this still proves to be true today.
It is said that all men are born equal, regardless of their race, color, sex and nationality etc..
They do whatever they like, ignoring the law, ignoring the social conventions.
It is the law that has promised the equal rights for all races.
It is also the law that sentences criminals of different races in a different way.
This is the case not only in the States, but in almost every country around the world.
Go back to China.
It is known to all that lots of government officials, along with their families, lead luxurious and corrupt lives, becoming the privileged class in the society.
They make full use of their powers to seek for their own interests.
They do this by hook or by crook, even by committing crimes.
They are not afraid of any punishment, for they have the so-called "relation web" which will protect them quite well.
They have contributed a lot to the rapid development of the economy.
But what have they got?
They haven't been guaranteed the basic rights of payment, safety and freedom.
How could this tragedy happen?
Where are their rights of safety and freedom then?
Who is to be blamed for this tragedy, their capitalist boss or our socialist law which has promised every citizen equal rights in labour?
Surely it needs our great efforts to achieve human equality for all the people.
But we will always cherish the hope of an equal society in our mind, we will always strive for this aim.
Those leaders promised people equality and democracy.
But after they gained power, they became dictators.
They had special authorities which others couldn't possess.
Now, the U.S.S.R has collapsed.
Russia has taken the place of it.
Russia was set up as a democracy.
At least, Russian President Boris Yeltsin claimed that Russia was a democracy.
Before he was President of Russia, he had preached pluralism in politics.
His words represented people's wish.
Therefore he was elected the President.
About the method of reform, there were different opinions.
Some people preferred a gradual reform.
Some advocated a radical one.
The Russian Parliament supported a gradual reform while the Russian President was in favour of a radical one.
There was controversy between the Parliament and the president.
Without parliament, no one could control his power and oppose his policy.
He became a real dictator.
The parliament didn't obey his order.
Then, he sent troops to surround the parliament building.
He threw the leader of the parliament into prison.
Is this a civil rule?
No.
His power came from the barrel.
Now, he has more power than others.
The president has advocated pluralism before.
He said different idea should be allowed and opposition party should be allowed to take part in the election.
But before the new parliament election, the president announced that his opponent, Ruslan Khasbulatov, whom he had thrown in prison, was not allowed to take part in the election.
He cracked down on his opponent by military means.
The president will have no opponent in the election.
His party will certainly win.
But all the significance of election will lose because people have only one choice.
He defends his interest at the expense of other's rights.
It is impossible for the officials in his government to regard themselves as ordinary citizens.
The officials have the authority to deal with the possession of the country.
They illegally sell some important material at the market to hit big .
This has led to the disorder in economy.
The Russian economy has been declining.
The unemployment rate is soaring and the living standard is falling.
Russia is not a real democracy.
(t10-16) I saw the Animal Farm from the video.
Actually, this was an interesting story.
The screenwriter made use of the animals to reflect the idea and emotion of the human being.
"All animals are equal, no animals kill the other animals.
" This was one of the rules of the animal farm.
But in fact, the animals did not obey this rule.
Finally, the good animals rose up and wiped out the bad animals.
"I HAVE A DREAM" was an article which I just finished.
This speech was made by Martin Luther King Jr.
In his speech he expressed his strong hope that one day all black people and white people were equal in America.
All that made me sad.
I asked myself why the human being could not unite and live friendly.
I couldn't help thinking of the situation at present.
Maybe I was born in 70's and have not experienced hardships.
I am growing up in a happy environment.
Living standard was improved.
People work very hard and earn their own money.
Then they use their money to buy services and goods that they like.
Some people even run their own business.
Gradually, you will find you live in a competitive society.
Everybody has rights to compete.
The more money you earn, the more happiness you enjoy.
My mother works in a plastics factory.
They wire the bag on a piece-rate system.
The plastics materials are divided into two kinds.
They often call on him, bringing a lot of gifts and try their best to please him.
In return, they usually get soft piece and good marks in the monthly report.
She often blows off steam at home.
My father persuades her to be a yesman.
That's unfair and unequal.
I hope one day the millennium will arrive.
All people can live equally.
(t10-17) In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" Though this statement is seemingly ridiculous, it is sadly true.
All men are created equal, as the Bible says.
And some countries have already put it into their constitutions because they regard equality as a most valuable thing.
However, in reality, when all men are crying for equality, inequality has its firm position almost everywhere.
It is not unusual in many countries that a small group of people enjoy higher social status along with more privileges, more freedom and more priorities at the expense of unequal treatment of others.
Nothing, I think, illustrates the inequality between people better than racial discrimination.
In many developed countries which boast of being the most democratic countries, white people always take precedence over colour citizens, especially over black people.
They have to live in special sections of the city and they have to accept their unsatisfactory living conditions.
Since their children can not receive proper education, they are not likely to get high-paid jobs and improve their living conditions.
So a vicious cycle forms.
Brazil, one of the original homes of black people, has gradually become a white country.
It boasts of no racial segregation as it has no laws against black people.
But the white are taking the lead of this country in its politics and economy.
The black illiterates are twice as many as the white illiterates.
From this, we can imagine what the life of the black is like in other countries which have stipulations against the black in explicit terms.
Colour citizens are always in the second class of the society.
They give more, but receive much less than they deserve.
Although people have struggled for equality for quite a long time and have made some progress, racial discrimination and racial segregation are still a big social problem.
When can the manacles and chains that have crippled colour people for so long be smashed?
Inequality between men and women in this man-dominating society is also remarkable.
Though women's conditions since then have been greatly improved, women are still far from being equal to men.
You will find the following common: Women get less pay for the same amount of work; women are always sort of discriminated by others while working together with them; and it costs women a lot more to get the same position and so on.
In a word, women have less opportunities to fulfill themselves.
In rural areas of China, many girls are not allowed to receive higher education because their parents consider it useless for girls to receive any higher education.
They think that being helpful in housework or even farmwork is much more valuable than studying any books.
So many girls leave school after graduating from primary schools, or even before their graduation they have to quit.
It mainly results from unequal distribution of wealth between people and results in unequal economic status, political status, social status, etc., which lead to further inequality.
So, in order to fight against inequality efficiently, people from the lower classes must learn how to gain equal economic status first through every possible measurement.
Then all other things will follow like a stream.
Being equal between all men is a sweet dream, in which "all men will be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness".
(t10-18) "That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
" The architects of the America wrote these magnificent words in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
Now, more than 200 years has passed.
Has this wonderful dream of all Americans come true?
Are all American people equal?
When asked to answer this question, I would have nothing to say but "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
But it is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note so far as most of the citizens of the country are concerned.
It seems that people in that country are equal to one another and it is really very fascinating to a lot of people.
However, this is only the specious writing and the superficial phenomenon.
In fact, there are many restrictions to these rights when people are to exercise these rights.
Although the law states that all men are equal to have these rights, no chances are provided for most of the people.
For example, the law says that everyone has the equal right to be elected.
However, it will cost one several million US dollars to run for the congressman and even more for the presidency.
However, there are very few people who have so much money to cover the cost.
So, to be a president of America is only a wonderful dream of the common citizens of America and it will never be possible for the common citizens to be a president, no matter how equal they are.
So I have to say "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
White men are still having better education, are living in better houses, and are occupying higher positions.
However, the black men are still languishing in the corners of American society and find themselves exiles in their own land.
Although the black men have struggled for a long time for equal rights, the local authorities still reflect the popular prejudices against the black; there are many cases of injustice.
The riot in Los Angels broke out a few years ago just because of the police brutality against the black.
In fact, the black men are still the victims of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.
So, what we can say is still "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" (t10-19) I think today it is still true to say "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.
" The famous saying was first written by George Orwell in his novel "Animal Farm".
The novel tells a story of an animal kingdom.
At first all the animals lived and worked together equally.
One day they rose up and drove their master away.
Then things changed.
Since a pig was elected as the leader of the kingdom, all the pigs realized that they were in a privileged position.
So they began to work much less than other animals or even stop working at all, and enjoy the best food produced by others.
We know that all men are created equal.
Even in the United States, a country always shows great concern about human rights in other countries, the situation is not so satisfying.
Most of its black people are living in ghettos.
Their children cannot receive good education, and the adults cannot find good jobs.
If they do wrong, they would get more serious punishment than those white men.
Racial discrimination has prevented them from enjoying the prosperity which the white people are enjoying.
But little can be done to change it in a very short time.
The white men don't want to give the black men the same amount of wealth and opportunity, for fear that they would lose a lot, or even their dominion.
Only when people learn the exact meaning of "All men are equal", and keep it in heart, can the black men enjoy the same rights as the white.
We can find examples for this very easily.
The following is one.
Each year there are many students who would sit for the College Entrance Exam.
It is said that only those high-level students can win the competition and enter colleges.
But in fact, we can see that many students of lower marks can enter a better college and choose a better speciality to study.
People can do nothing to stop it but complain.
They just think it very natural for those with power to make use of their power, they would make full "use" of the power as well.
It's almost a truth that men are selfish animals.
And it seems impossible for all the men to overcome it.
(t10-20) In his novel, Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others".
At that time, it was considered as a reflection of the situation in the Soviet Union.
Dozens of years has now passed since it was written in 1930s, from my point of view, it is still true today, although the world has changed a lot.
In every country all over the world, you can easily perceive that the case still remains true.
But let's be specific by taking American society as an example.
Though after the war Negroes were set free, it was nominal.
I was surprised to hear that instead of being punished in the legal way, he got brutal beating by two white policemen as his punishment.
Let's look at the American society once more.
The constitution says every citizen has the right to vote as well as the right to stand for election.
The reality is another story.
Closer to the point, you will lose in whatever election it is without sufficient money support.
Thus, in a sense, most of the American citizens have no right to be elected at all.
So, in a nutshell, the case which George Orwell described sixty years ago remains true.
A woman will be in a great trouble if she puts forward a claim for breaking up her marriage.
The rumors and slanders will engulf her.
But it is quite natural for a man to submit a case for divorcing his wife.
In a family, the wife is dominated by her husb
