The Chinese diet is considered to be the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> healthies </ERR> in the world.
So I am very happy to be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Chinses </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> worset </ERR> thing is that many westerners die in an early age from the heart illness.
So I <ERR type=[vp6,s-][vp1,2-2]> thought </ERR> eat more fruit and vegetables, not to <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> ear </ERR> too much sugar and fat is a real healthy diet.
They're the <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> basicest </ERR> food in our life.
Next, people should have more green vegetables & <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> , they're a part of a healthy diet.
People should have <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> fewer </ERR> food which contains a lot of fat, sugar, western diets are always quite unhealthy, we should <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> ear </ERR> less.
The foods which contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on is a healthy <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> diet </ERR> .
However, a new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hamburgar </ERR> restaurant in Beijing was quite popular.
A doctor advised people not to have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hamburgar </ERR> for it's not a good diet.
The <ERR type=[vp3,1-5]> diet </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> between </ERR> Chinese and <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> Western </ERR> are different.
Some people said that the western food is good <ERR type=[fm2,1-][wd3,1-]> eatting </ERR> .
It's good <ERR type=[fm2,1-][wd3,1-]> eatting </ERR> but it isn't good for your healthy.
Because most of them <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> are </ERR> contain too much flower, fat and sugar.
People need energy everywhere, every <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> time </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> western </ERR> eat too much food with sugar and fat, like <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hamburger </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fired </ERR> chicken, coca cola, chocolate and so on.
Most of the <ERR type=[np3,1-]> westerner </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> had </ERR> weight problem and heart illness.
If every <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> thing </ERR> you eat just right and do more exercise, you will be healthy.
<ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> People </ERR> considers Chinese diet is the healthiest of all.
The <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> things </ERR> which people needs are all in the Chinese diet.
Some people say that the food in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Mcdonald's </ERR> restaurant and Pizza Nut is delicious.
You eat too much sugar, your <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> body </ERR> becomes fat, after that <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> You </ERR> will have heart illness.
The Chinese diet is thought of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> healthies </ERR> in the world.
It <ERR type=[fm1,-]> coutain </ERR> a lot of fruit and green vegetable.
But in the west, people love <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> eat </ERR> hamburgers, potato crisps, potato chips, butter, and chocolate.
But if people eat more <ERR type=[aj1,1-]> these </ERR> food, would put on weight very easily .
So people should <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> be </ERR> eat less fat and sugar.
This is <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> a </ERR> good advice.
Eat more <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> and green vegetables are good for healthy diet .
I think this diet list is good for people: everyday eat two <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> , eat more vegetables in dinner .
It's good for <ERR type=[wd7,1]> skin </ERR> .
You need water and <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> a </ERR> diet of healthy foods.
The Chinese food is considered to be the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> healthist </ERR> in the world.
Once you start to eat it, you want to eat more <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> it.
<ERR type=[wd5,1-]> It's </ERR> also contains a lot of fat in the form of cakes, soft drinks, sweets and so on.
So, if you want to have a healthy body, <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Please </ERR> don't eat much western food.
" I think <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> everyone </ERR> want to know it.
Energy is important <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> to </ERR> us.
All of these can make you become fat, and bad for your <ERR type=[fm1,-]> teech </ERR> .
As a result, we now that a healthy diet should contain lots of fruit, green vegetables, because <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> these </ERR> thing are low in sugar and fat but rich in fibre.
Each person cares about <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> their </ERR> life.
To have a good diet can make our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lifes </ERR> longer.
<ERR type=[wd4,s]> There's </ERR> difference between Chinese and Western diet.
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forgin </ERR> countries, people don't eat such healthy food.
<ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> It's </ERR> foods which contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on.
Because of this, they can put on weight very <ERR type=[ad2,1-]> easy </ERR> .
You can't only eat too much sweet foods, but also <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> others </ERR> foods.
For example, the <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> .
If you eat too much <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> , it's bad for your stomach.
As usual, the <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> diet </ERR> food must contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt, fruit, green vegetables and so on.
So to eat more <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> and vegetables than sugar, salt is better .
<ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> Everybody </ERR> want a healthy diet.
That <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> is </ERR> can make <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> they </ERR> healthy.
They eat a lot of potato crisps potato chips, butter ice-cream <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> and </ERR> chocolate and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> these </ERR> things make <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> they </ERR> become fat.
Several kinds of <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> meat </ERR> is not a necessary part of meat are good for your body .
Westerners <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> take </ERR> this kind of food and don't take enough exercises.
They have <ERR type=[np7,1-]> a </ERR> unhealthy body.
Healthy Diet How <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> many </ERR> kind of foods are there in the world?
But there's one thing I know is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ture </ERR> : the Chinese food is considered to be healthiest diet in the world.
Many doctors advise people not to eat the food which high in fat and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sugr </ERR> .
The westerners always eat the <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> high </ERR> fat <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> and </ERR> high sugar food.
In some parts of Britain, one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> preson </ERR> in ten, by the age of thirty, has no teeth left!
That's why <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> lot </ERR> of <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> chinese </ERR> have healthy body and <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> whiter </ERR> teeth.
The western diet <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> are </ERR> high in fat.
Sugar and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sault </ERR> .
As a result, many westerners <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> diet </ERR> at heart illness and most of them have weight problem.
So, if you want to have a healthy <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> body </ERR> , you must have a healthy diet.
If you are thin, you can eat <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hamburgar </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chocolater </ERR> , sugar and so on.
Both fat <ERR type=[np6,2-]> person </ERR> and thin <ERR type=[np6,2-]> person </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> are </ERR> need energy to live.
It <ERR type=[wd4,s]> doesn't </ERR> much sugar.
The western <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> world </ERR> , don't eat too much fat and sugar and don't take enough exercise .
Now if you walk in the street, you can see all kinds of food shop, like coffee shop, McDonald's, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Timy's </ERR> and so on.
Many children very like McDonald's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hamberger </ERR> , fired chicken and icecream.
Many young ladies or <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> boys </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,2-4]> likes </ERR> stay in the western coffee shop.
In fact, the cream, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hamberger </ERR> milk tea, the big <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> piece </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> beer </ERR> has <ERR type=[np8,-1]> many </ERR> sugar and fat.
It's very unhealthy for the person's <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> body </ERR> and teeth.
" Chinese put the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> eat </ERR> in the first" it means Chinese foods are very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dilious </ERR> .
I think the Spanish food, the French food, the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> Japan </ERR> food, the England food are better but the <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> chinese </ERR> food is the best.
and the most important thing is <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> chinese </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> food </ERR> are more healthy <ERR type=[wd4,s]> than </ERR> another countries.
So, I advise the boys and girls, the mothers and the fathers and the little lovely <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> childrens </ERR> .
They eat different <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> of </ERR> food which <ERR type=[vp7,1-]> change </ERR> into energy.
Even when you are asleep, you are <ERR type=[wd7,2-2]> sing </ERR> energy- about 65 calories an hour.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> You </ERR> might be using 400calories an hour.
On sports <ERR type=[wd4,s]> day, </ERR> may be using 650 calories an hour.
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> contain </ERR> fruit and green food.
This food <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> just </ERR> contain a little fat, sugar, is better than western food .
<ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> It </ERR> contain so much fat, sugar, some people didn't take enough exercise.
Healthy <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Diet </ERR> is main some fat, some fibre, many fruit, many vegetables and enough exercise .
<ERR type=[wd4,s]> And </ERR> will have bad teeth.
Now, many hamburger restaurant open on <ERR type=[wd6]> many </ERR> places.
This will hurt <ERR type=[pr1,3-]> yourself </ERR> .
I advise <ERR type=[wd4,s]> people </ERR> eat enough fat and sugar.
And remember do more exercises and wash your teeth <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> every </ERR> day.
I had heard lots about the plane, someone told me by air was very <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> dangerous </ERR> thing, but some say no.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> at </ERR> that time I was a little boy, I felt deeply afraid.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-]> When </ERR> I got on the plane.
The plane began to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> taking </ERR> off.
<ERR type=[pp2,1-]> n </ERR> the plane, I watched the TV.
<ERR type=[vp1,-2]> Listen </ERR> the music, <ERR type=[vp6,s-4]> eat </ERR> the food, and talk happily with my parents.
I didn't feel <ERR type=[fm1,-]> afaid </ERR> any more!
From then on, I became <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> like </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s]> to </ERR> by air.
lesson, <ERR type=[fm3,3-]> That </ERR> can make me stronger, or the music class, It's wonderful.
I like <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> so much.
I <ERR type=[vp1,s]> can </ERR> know the music from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffirent </ERR> countries.
I can hear <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffirent </ERR> kinds of music.
Basketball <ERR type=[fm1,-]> matchs </ERR> , I also like it .
It's definitely <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> in </ERR> !
When I read the beautiful <ERR type=[np6,s-]> paragraph </ERR> , I feel natural.
In any case, I like <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> .
Some of my <ERR type=[np3,3-]> friend </ERR> often went cycling <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> very </ERR> much.
Thought here were still a <ERR type=[aj2,1-]> lot </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> hurt </ERR> on my body, I felt very pleased.
[fm3,-1] Teacher.
Last weekend the P.E.teacher <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> told </ERR> there would be a basketball match next week.
<ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Every </ERR> Team he should do this <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> suddenly </ERR> thing.
How <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> can </ERR> we get ready?
Also he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> wants </ERR> to make a normal match.
But he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> doesn't </ERR> have enough ability.
The watch would not be <ERR type=[vp9,s]> stop </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[fm2,1-5]> adjudgers </ERR> are poor in the <ERR type=[fm3]> sdjudge </ERR> of basketball match.
Can you <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> close </ERR> what I wrote?
I remember one day, the weather <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> rainly </ERR> .
Susanna took <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> my </ERR> <ERR type=[vp2,3-]> up </ERR> and went <ERR type=[fm3]> tomy </ERR> home.
Then she <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> look </ERR> after me carefully, because my parents didn't at home.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> glad I have a good friend.
Every time, I always <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> though </ERR> my monkeys.
Oh, By the way, they aren't common <ERR type=[np3,s-]> monkey </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> On </ERR> that time, Mom called me to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> saw </ERR> the monkey.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> siad </ERR> Yes.
I think the monkey was <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> play </ERR> .
But that's wrong, one of the monkeys called Bobby, when I saw her, she lay on the floor, and the floor had <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> very </ERR> a lot of blood.
That's very <ERR type=[vp6,s]> terrible </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frighent </ERR> , I called my Mom came here .
She saw it when she <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> arrived </ERR> the house, the monkey <ERR type=[vp7,s]> was </ERR> died.
We <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> don't </ERR> now how she died.
I just know Bobby is my good <ERR type=[vp6,s]> friend </ERR> .
I cannot <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> never </ERR> forget her.
Maybe you think this <ERR type=[wd4,s]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> smell </ERR> thing.
I saw Bobby <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bron </ERR> .
I saw Bobby <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> died </ERR> .
She is very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> importen </ERR> to me.
I think not body can instead <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> of </ERR> her.
But <ERR type=[fm1,-]> luckly </ERR> , we was waken up by the dog, and we put out the fire in time.
At that time, I was always afraid of travelling by <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> plain </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> watch </ERR> too much of flying accident on TV.
So when I got on the plane, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shaked </ERR> my hand all the time.
Flying accident is much less than road accident," I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> become </ERR> less hand shaking.
But it's flying from Beijing to Moscow, it <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> take </ERR> ten hours <ERR type=[ad1,1-]> nearly </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> can </ERR> see only white heavy cloudy beneath us.
<ERR type=[vp6,s-]> It's </ERR> Beautiful, but <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> I'm </ERR> not so interesting in it.
" <ERR type=[fm1,-1]> luckly </ERR> , this <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> does </ERR> not happen.
But the most impressive thing in my life I think is <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> this </ERR> .
I remember it was Sunday afternoon, I was <ERR type=[vp1,1-1]> listening </ERR> music, suddenly father <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> change </ERR> the tape.
Then I heard my voice <ERR type=[vp4,1-]> come </ERR> out of the trumpet and it surprised me.
Then father came and he said: " <ERR type=[fm3]> silly </ERR> boy , you're not in it.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> that's </ERR> what you said two days ago and I recorded.
During last term, I very hard to study, and I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> always </ERR> did my homework after seven <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> lesson </ERR> .
So, in the middle exam, I get the good mark for myself, the math's mark is one hundred and thirty-three, the <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> chemistry </ERR> is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ninty </ERR> (the full mark is one hundred).
My <ERR type=[wd4,s]> rank </ERR> is twenty.
During these fifteen years, many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> thing </ERR> happened.
But the <ERR type=[wd4,s]> only </ERR> thing I still remember, is <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> this </ERR> .
The sun was shining <ERR type=[ad2,1-]> hard </ERR> .
At first, <ERR type=[wd4,s]> we </ERR> all very happy.
Then we <ERR type=[wd4,s]> reached </ERR> .
And their lives was very <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> easy </ERR> .
The thing they ate every day was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> porrdge </ERR> and some things which were bad to eat .
After a meal, we went to the children's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> framily </ERR> .They were really poor.
We found no <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dest </ERR> in their house.
By the talk between us, I knew all the children in that village all <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> work </ERR> hard.
I <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> though </ERR> "They were poor, but they were all hardworking.
?ut I, <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> I </ERR> richer than them, my study were very bad .
From that journey, I knew a truth: If you want to study well, you have to <ERR type=[wd4,s]> give </ERR> .
The most impressive thing in my life North Korea is a <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> socialism </ERR> country near China, I couldn't remember when I had been on this land, but its wonderful <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviorment </ERR> & <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> korean's </ERR> passions was still in my heart.
I miss the Chinese brave warrior who had bled <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> here </ERR> , had fought for the freedom, had fought for the liberation!
There are plenty of Monuments for commemorating the friendship <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> of </ERR> China & Korea.
To impress me most is a monument on a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mauntain </ERR> , Chinese national flag & <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> korean </ERR> national flag were put together, it meant that our friendship would never change, and a coffin was put in a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tempel </ERR> near the monument, though I <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> didn't </ERR> who was lying in it, one thing was <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> certain </ERR> , he was a hero.
Ping <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> yong </ERR> was a crowded city with clean air and good weather.
sadness was <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> arounding </ERR> over the city, it remained me the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucessgful </ERR> thing he had done, he gave precious <ERR type=[np5,1-]> peaces </ERR> to North Korea, he will always stay in Koreans' hearts.
There is a river in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frunt </ERR> of my house.
When I <ERR type=[wd4,s]> was </ERR> child I often swam <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> their </ERR> in summer.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> One </ERR> thing is coming into my mind.
When I was <ERR type=[wd4,s]> eight </ERR> old, that year's summer was very hot, one day, some children and I went to this river to swim.
The middle of the river was very <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> deeply </ERR> and I could not come there.
After a <ERR type=[wd4,s]> short </ERR> ,they saw me standing at the side of the river <ERR type=[wd4,s]> then </ERR> called me <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> swam </ERR> to the <ERR type=[wd4,s]> middle </ERR> .
but one of them said: " It doesn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> metter </ERR> , have a try.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> shout </ERR> " <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> help </ERR> ".
Then all the children swam to me and pulled me <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> into </ERR> the river, took me to the side of the river and said: " Are you ok?
" I said: " it doesn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> metter </ERR> , I will be ok soon.
Because I was a newcomer, when I came to the school <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> the </ERR> classmates were having class.
When I reached the class, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Istanded </ERR> in front of the classroom's door.
The foreigner <ERR type=[wd4,s]> teacher </ERR> me.
Every <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> body </ERR> in the class looked at me.
I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> standed </ERR> for a moment and answer the foreigner teacher.
The classmate looked at me strangely, and then they laughed, I didn't know why they <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> laugh </ERR> at that time.
Because I just can answer the question <ERR type=[wd4,s]> with </ERR> word, "Yes, Yes is my answer.
But the foreign teacher told the students not to laugh at me, and told me not to worry about it, and then <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> call </ERR> me to go to the seat.
There are <ERR type=[wd6]> many </ERR> impressive <ERR type=[np3,2-]> thing </ERR> in my life.
It happened two years <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> age </ERR> in a summer holiday.
We <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> meet </ERR> a big air.
So many people didn't catch the safe <ERR type=[wd4,s]> belt </ERR> flew to the top of the plane.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Luckly </ERR> I caught my safe belt.
In that night, my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mothe </ERR> got up and helped me to eat the pill.
My mother very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stricted </ERR> by me.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-]> Since </ERR> three years ago, I began to get to know this society.
We <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> don't </ERR> knew each other at all.
Miss Wang was also our head teacher and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> maths </ERR> teacher.
In my life, there were <ERR type=[wd6]> many </ERR> impressive things, they are all <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Improtant </ERR> for me.
This for me is very <ERR type=[wd2,-]> impression </ERR> .
Before that time I was sure that is boy's games and it was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffcult </ERR> for us.
So every classes must be <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> chose </ERR> some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> helthy </ERR> girls to do this .
We often make some excises not to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratise </ERR> .
When <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> hand </ERR> teacher Liu found this, we were <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> lessoned </ERR> by him.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> form </ERR> that time, we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratised </ERR> that on time, and hare working .
After one week, we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratised </ERR> very well, other <ERR type=[np3,1-]> class </ERR> were <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> frighten </ERR> us and we score that we will the winner .
We all felt afraid, but <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> hand </ERR> teacher Lui said to us: "Don't be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> afraid </ERR> , you are going to be the first.
You not only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratised </ERR> well, but also the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> storgest </ERR> .
We heard the other classmate said, " <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hoory </ERR> , you are well done *" How the most impressive thing in my life.
While I was young, I didn't go out because I was afraid the other children would <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fighten </ERR> me.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> uausally </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> help </ERR> my mother with housework.
One day, my mother went out, I came back from school, but I didn't <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> bright </ERR> the keys.
I thought: if I said <ERR type=[aj1,1-1]> wrong </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> something </ERR> .
Suddenly, when I played with a nice knife, I hurt my hands, then my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pinger </ERR> was bleeding.
The boy ran to his bedroom and brought some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> medisines </ERR> .
Every player <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> were </ERR> very hard.
Everybody <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> were </ERR> very happy.
In one's life, I think there are so <ERR type=[np8,s-]> much </ERR> impressive <ERR type=[np3,s-]> thing </ERR> will happen.
So <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> am </ERR> I.
When I was a child, I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> don't </ERR> know everything.
My father <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> want </ERR> to buy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sth </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> to </ERR> him and put them on his?
[wd4,1-] When I grow up.
<ERR type=[fm3,s-]> My </ERR> father tell me this thing.
The most impressive thing in my life In my career, I have many impressive <ERR type=[np3,3-]> thing </ERR> .
They thought that was dangerous and absurd " It was absurd of you to suggest such a thing" Many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> head </ERR> of a family said.
The most <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> impression </ERR> thing in my life
Especially in the morning and the afternoon when the people have to go for work or come back from work, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> althought </ERR> you stand near the subway station, a lot of people walk quickly towards you and leave you in no time, you just have no place to stay for a minute, maybe time for them is the most important, I could really understand "Time is money" The third day when I got <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> here </ERR> , my elder cousin showed me around his university: The Hong Kong Science University and we had a good time there.
Of course the environment <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> here </ERR> is wonderful.
The lives <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> here </ERR> are interesting.
The environment <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> here </ERR> is wonderful.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> here </ERR> are many things impress me a lot.
But there's one thing I feel so deep, and I'm sure that it makes me <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wanna </ERR> be a nice people .
That was a <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> saturday </ERR> afternoon, I was sitting on the floor and drinking a bottle of juice.
My father sitting beside me, <ERR type=[wd6,4-]> he </ERR> was looking a newspaper.
Suddenly, I heard a loud <ERR type=[fm1,-]> noice </ERR> : " son!
If <ERR type=[fm1,-]> veryone </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> throw </ERR> some can below, what'll be.
<ERR type=[wd4,s]> " </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,s]> "sorry </ERR> , Dad" then I picked up the can and throw into the right place.
Both girls and boys in our class non the preliminary contest, so the two match <ERR type=[vp4,-]> holded </ERR> in the same time .
At first, the girls in our class was lead two points, but not long after, the class <ERR type=[np1,2-]> two </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cought </ERR> up with our class, and then the class <ERR type=[np1,2-]> 2 </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> surpass </ERR> us, <ERR type=[cj1,1-8]> though </ERR> our class spare no efforts to play, but at last our class lose the match, but we still got the second place.
This <ERR type=[wd4,s]> match </ERR> impressing me very much.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Febray </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd4,s]> 19th </ERR> our Great Chairman Deng Xiao <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> Pins </ERR> died and all the people of China were sad.
He rescue China <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whe </ERR> she is very backward country he save China anew life .
He <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> make </ERR> the Hong Kong come back.
He let China unify so quickly, we all can't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forset </ERR> him.
He and Lu Bo <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> Chen </ERR> lead the army to hit the enemy, and liberate all the China with all the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comard </ERR> -in-arms, He is one of China's founding fathers.
He gave <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> China's </ERR> people rich life but he is die .
He is a Great man of the world, so went he was die, UN <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> fall </ERR> half of the UN flag.
A lot of foreign <ERR type=[fm1,-]> counteries </ERR> Chairman give Chinese <ERR type=[fm1,-]> totelegram </ERR> of condolence .
I was a Chinese, I must study hard to <ERR type=[fm3]> Build </ERR> the modern China, and don't lost Great father Deng's hope.
That was <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> at </ERR> 1989?
: at that <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> the </ERR> New Year, My father gave me one hundreds year for pocket when I took a pieces of one hundreds year, I was very happy.
That <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> hundred </ERR> year I used for three months.
But now <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> hundred </ERR> year can't used for one day something.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-]> On </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Septemper </ERR> , 1994, my parents sent me to this school.
Though you're unhappy now, I'm sure after some days, you <ERR type=[wd4,s]> will </ERR> happy again.
My childhood is full of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> happy </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> bitter </ERR> .
But sometimes I did <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sth </ERR> wrong and made them worried and sad.
I remembered when I was a school girl, <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> A </ERR> new student came to our class, she is a tall girl.
Slowly, I changed, I always came home late and did not work hard, my parents and the teacher noticed <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> my </ERR> many times.
At last, she asked me to go out for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> glaying </ERR> , but I had no much money, because my mother didn't give me any more, and I knew they wouldn't let me go our with her.
So she suggested me to take mother's money away without telling her, and my mother <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dioovered </ERR> my bad deed.
She didn't hit me but cried, and I was frightened because my strong mother never cry before people, I began to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> realized </ERR> that it was rather serious, so I conceded my mistake, but when my tall friends knew that, she was angry, she said I was foolish and never had a word with me, after that when I told my mother about it, Mum said: " as friend she shouldn't ask you to come home late, ask you to steal, she is not a real friend or a good friend.
And I realized that I was rather foolish at that time, because I made a person who nearly let me <ERR type=[wd4,s]> go </ERR> the wrong way as my best friend.
I'll <ERR type=[fm1,-]> neven </ERR> forget this lesson.
When I was six years old, my parents sent me to the swimming school and learn how to swim you may ask me: " <ERR type=[fm1,-]> why </ERR> ?
" I think that may <ERR type=[wd7,s]> be </ERR> my parents wanted to make my body stronger and stronger than the others of my age.
But later, I found it more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffcult </ERR> than I had thought .
So I didn't like swimming and began to take it <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> .when </ERR> the teacher asked me to jump into water and <ERR type=[vp5,7-]> swimming </ERR> a long way, I just told a lie to the teacher, and sit near the water just looking at the other children in the water.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-]> That </ERR> is the most impressive thing in my life?
When I was a baby, my mother often filled the bathtub with water <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nd </ERR> put me in it when she was going to get ready for the meals.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> like </ERR> playing with water very much.
In fact, I had never tried to swim more than ten <ERR type=[fm1,-]> metres </ERR> .
In this winter holiday, my sister <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> invite </ERR> me to her birthday party.
Her birthday <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> February 13th.
On that night, she <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> invite </ERR> seventeen people to her party.
First, we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> say </ERR> to her " Happy birthday!
" Then, we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> sing </ERR> the " Happy birthday" song, "Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday *.
Um, how <ERR type=[fm1,-]> delicrous </ERR> !
There have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plichards </ERR> , fruit pies, sweetmeat, many kinds of fruit.
They all very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> delicrous </ERR> !
And then, we <ERR type=[vp6,s-2]> watch </ERR> TV, play cards, some people <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> play </ERR> game <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bad </ERR> , some people <ERR type=[vp6,s-4]> catch </ERR> seize, some people talking* Look there <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> my sister and her friend Mary, they were talking happily.
She giving drinks to Mary and John, and she put her gifts beside the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Jalip </ERR> .
In this party, everyone was <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> happily </ERR> .
Everyday I must <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> payed </ERR> a New Year call to other one.
Or other one <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> payed </ERR> a New Year to me.
I think I will have more money, and I am very tried and <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> pity </ERR> in this week.

Get to <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> winshop </ERR> we are all anxious go to have hot spring.
So I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> call </ERR> them meet on the playground in the minutes ago.
Because we were playing a very interesting <ERR type=[np3,3-]> games </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> first </ERR> , I was idea how to play?
But suddenly Li Fei <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> says </ERR> " What about have a 100-metre <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tace </ERR> ?
So I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> stand </ERR> at the <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> sind </ERR> of the playground and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> says </ERR> " Ready I Go!
First, they were <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> neck </ERR> and neck.

I like play basketball, I played basketball in spring holiday, Every day, I got up at a quarter to six, then I went to play basketball, Maybe some body will laugh me, some one <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> will </ERR> said: " you're <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stiput </ERR> , if I <ERR type=[vp8,1-]> am </ERR> you, I <ERR type=[vp8,1-]> will </ERR> sleep to eleven or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> twlve </ERR> " But I didn't mind, because it was my favourite.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-3]> thought </ERR> if something was your favourite, you will do it yourself.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> likes </ERR> dogs very much.
I was very glad, because Dad said that he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> will </ERR> give me as soon as possible, so I asked Dad: " Oh, Dad, Did you say you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> will </ERR> give me a present?
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> I </ERR> was "101 Days".
I was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suprised </ERR> , because I wanted to buy it many days ago.
She <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> had </ERR> two big eyes, a lot of black <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hait </ERR> , and a fat baby.
The doctor said : The baby <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> sleep </ERR> for twelve hours one day.
I think: <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> She </ERR> is very happy.
One day, my parents and I to the Guang zhou <ERR type=[fm1,-]> epartment </ERR> store.
At last we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> go </ERR> home.
<ERR type=[wd6]> Many </ERR> people go to Eastern Park for weekend.
So I went to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Easten </ERR> Park also.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> we </ERR> had a good time in the park.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> because </ERR> it and tide wait for no man.
I was worried about my spoken English, <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Because </ERR> I'm a little weak in it.
Well, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Anyway </ERR> , I will study hard!
I can have <ERR type=[np8,1-]> many </ERR> time for rest.
But the bad thing <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> coming with me.
It last for a week time.In that week, I lay in bed everyday <ERR type=[fm1,-]> excapt </ERR> went to see the doctor.
When I opened my eyes, I always <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> see </ERR> my mother.

Maybe somebody will say how <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> can </ERR> I talk that, but let's have a think.
For example in summer the weather is very hot, like Wuhan the temperature is always above thirty- six, even forty in the day- time, so many people in Wuhan don't like to go <ERR type=[fm1,-]> our </ERR> in summer.
But at night the temperature will be cool <ERR type=[ad1,1-1]> a </ERR> little.
In winter, some of Chinese <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paces </ERR> are very cold, like Harbin the weather is very cold, sometimes it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> snow </ERR> very hard, and the temperature is usually below zero all day, but after snow, you look around the snow is beautiful, I like the scene very much.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Because </ERR> there were not many people in it.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> They </ERR> were all going to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> bought </ERR> breakfast.
Their <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> milk </ERR> was freezing.
For a long time, the sun <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> were </ERR> going out, but nothing changed, it looked like just now: Very cold!
During the Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Fistival </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> we were arrive at the father's C.O.
And then I take <ERR type=[np8,1-]> many </ERR> lucky money.
After that I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> go </ERR> to aunt's home.

Every year, in <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> the </ERR> Guang Zhoy there had some show.
The <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> brightly </ERR> in the sky, it like beautiful flowers in the sky.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> have </ERR> a enjoyable day.
A day in the winter <ERR type=[wd4,s]> holiday </ERR> The winter holiday I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> go </ERR> back <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> town </ERR> home with my presents.
I'll take the money to <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> the </ERR> back.
I took the broom <ERR type=[fm1,-]> begain </ERR> clean the floor.
Then I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> go </ERR> to clean the floor with the mop.
In a moment the floor <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> turn </ERR> very clean.
And I must go to shopping, mother <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> give </ERR> me a list, oh!
It's <ERR type=[wd6]> many </ERR> things: the fruit, the sweet, the drinks*.
About at five o'clock in the afternoon, I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> go </ERR> back home.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> feel </ERR> tired <ERR type=[ad1,1-]> very </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> much </ERR> .
But I very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> haapy </ERR> .
Because I <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> can </ERR> help my mother of a lot of things.
The forest, grass, building, churches, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Everywhere </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fulls </ERR> of European colours.
It's the neighbors of ours.They played their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sereo </ERR> so loud that I <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> can't </ERR> sleep.
" oh, <ERR type=[vp6,s-3]> I've </ERR> had it, I'm going to go over there and give them a piece of my mind!
I've <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> heart </ERR> <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> it's </ERR> name for a long time.
There <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[wd6]> many </ERR> trees and flowers in it.
Some of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> invaluabel </ERR> trees will die.
Because no one took care of them I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thike </ERR> they're poor.
In that day, I with my mother went to Xing Hua <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> Bookshop </ERR> in Beijing Road.In the bookshop I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> have </ERR> to my heart's content as much as my likes to choose my favourite book.
Most of them <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> about the literature: There <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> prose, essay, and some <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> the novel.

Because, I think, he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> a healthy man.
Why he <ERR type=[vp6,s-1]> can't </ERR> got money himself?
If he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> an old man, I'll <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> think </ERR> he can't work, he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pool </ERR> man.
But he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> a young man, and was strong, he <ERR type=[vp6,s-1]> can </ERR> got money himself, why he was doing that?

I finished my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Juior </ERR> middle school study and <ERR type=[vp6,s-][wd4,1-1]> continue </ERR> study in high <ERR type=[fm1,-]> middly </ERR> school in 1996.Now, I am a middle school student, I found it much different from times ago .
First, I like to study and <ERR type=[vp4,5-3]> known </ERR> study is <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[aj4,1-1]> interested </ERR> thing and it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> become </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> important part in my life, I want to study.
I like all the <ERR type=[np6,2-]> sport </ERR> for example <ERR type=[vp4,2-4]> play </ERR> basketball and so on.
Last <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> study </ERR> term with my classmates won the first price in Grade One, sport <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> become </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> important part in my life too.
And I like music too popular <ERR type=[np6,1-]> song </ERR> , country music and so on.
These are something about me what do you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thing </ERR> about me?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> friend, Jim, is a zoo-keeper in the National Zoo.
Every morning the zoo-keepers have to <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> eat </ERR> up at five to prepare the food for the animals.
Each kind of animals is <ERR type=[wd7,-]> giver </ERR> special food.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> lions must be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> giver </ERR> meat, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> griaffes </ERR> must be given grass and leaves, the parrots must be given fruit and nuts, and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> sometimes </ERR> some animals won't let the others eat their food.
If this happens each of them must be <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> separately </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> .every </ERR> morning each cage must be washed by the zoo-keepers.
This can be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dengerous </ERR> , especially with lions and tigers.
To make the work easier, the animals are locked in the sleeping <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comparment </ERR> while the cages are being washed.
It is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nit </ERR> easy to inject a silk <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lien </ERR> !
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> radio </ERR> and television are very useful in the world.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> may be seen everywhere.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> television </ERR> of course is more useful than radio.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> on </ERR> TV we can see <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> that </ERR> is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happeared </ERR> around us.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> however </ERR> , radio is not <ERR type=[vp7,3-]> disappeared </ERR> .
It can be done very <ERR type=[wd7,s]> small </ERR> .
You can put one in your pocket and listen <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> in the bus or on your bike.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> radio is much more <ERR type=[aj3,2-]> cheaper </ERR> than television.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> once </ERR> there were two mice.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> many years the country mouse saw the city mouse.
He said," <ERR type=[fm3,3-s]> do </ERR> come and see me at my house in the country.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> the city mouse went.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> country mouse took him to his house in a field.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> city mouse said <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> ,"this </ERR> food is not good , and your house is not good .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> why </ERR> do you live in a hole in the field?
You can live in a mice <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> house </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,4-2]> make </ERR> of store.
You must <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> came </ERR> and see me at my house in the city.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> was a very good house.
Nice food was <ERR type=[wd5,-]> set </ERR> ready for them to eat.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> just as they began to eat they heard a great noise.
The city mouse cried: <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> run </ERR> !
<ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Run </ERR> !
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> cat is coming!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> ran away quickly and hid.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> some time they came out.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> they came out the country mouse said: "I don't like living in the city.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> as </ERR> a senior student, you may have realized the importance of English.
But how can you study English well?I think it necessary that you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shoud </ERR> try <ERR type=[pr4,-1]> you </ERR> best to use English.
We study English, not <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> study </ERR> about English.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> that </ERR> a person knows a set of grammatical rules and a lot of English words does not mean that he has mastered English.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> a </ERR> student's mastery of English is ultimately measured by how well we can use it, not by how much he knows about it.
I be <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> live </ERR> that learning English is just like learning to play the radio.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> a </ERR> student of the piano lessons has only one purpose: after practising, he is able to play the piano so you should also here such a purpose: you are able to use English.Using English <ERR type=[cc2,2-]> consists </ERR> of speaking English and writing compositions in English, in order to improve your spoken English.
You'd better take an active part in the teacher's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lecturse </ERR> answer his questions in English, and try to speak as much as you can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aiter </ERR> class.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> the same time you should listen to and read more English.
I work in a factory which <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> make </ERR> farm machinery.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s][wd4,1-2]> it </ERR> in Chongping, Sichuom <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Provinee </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> factory is quite big.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> there </ERR> are five workshops.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> there </ERR> are over a hundred workers on each shift in every workshop .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> there are two big storehouses.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> the factory yard is always crowded.
Such as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> siddes </ERR> , hoes and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shovds </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> every </ERR> day ships and boats come with <ERR type=[fm1,-]> saw </ERR> materials for the factory and leave with farm machines for cities, <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> town </ERR> and people's communes along the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Chang-Jiang </ERR> River and the Jialing River.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> as </ERR> the factory is a new one, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> must </ERR> of the workers are young people.
Three of the five workshop heads are old workers, one <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> is </ERR> young man of twenty-two.
The travel <ERR type=[wd7,3-3]> Various </ERR> runs a TV university branch school for young workers and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couds </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> learn maths.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> chomisty </ERR> physics and English, some the only one or two of the four <ERR type=[wd7,9-]> hours </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> technicians in the <ERR type=[wd7,2-1]> Various </ERR> laboratories help the young <ERR type=[np6,-s]> worker </ERR> in their study during their spare time.There is a <ERR type=[wd7,3-3]> dub </ERR> in every workshop.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> father bought a black -white TV set <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> then </ERR> I was <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> five </ERR> old.
Since then, I've <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> make </ERR> friends with it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> I was a primary school pupil, I liked to <ERR type=[wd7,3-3]> match </ERR> the children's programmes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> interesting stories are very delightful.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s][fm1,-]> though </ERR> these programmes I knew many important events at home and abroad.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> these news <ERR type=[np5,2-]> broadcasts </ERR> became our main topic of talks <ERR type=[fm1,-]> amony </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> us.when </ERR> I was <ERR type=[wd4,4-1]> 12 </ERR> old, my father bought a big colour TV set.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> colourful and beautiful pictures fascinated me.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> how </ERR> glad I was!
Now, I only <ERR type=[vp6,3-]> watched </ERR> the educational programmes and the news, of course <ERR type=[wd7,2-6]> of </ERR> there is a good film on TV.
I was born in Xin <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> xang </ERR> in Henan <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> province </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> my hometown is Xinxang.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> it hasn't many tall buildings .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> the things are cheap in here.
How Xinxiang is dire <ERR type=[fm2,3-]> lopping </ERR> quickly and there are some tall buildings had been set up.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> some </ERR> streets are built so <ERR type=[cc5,2-]> widely </ERR> , but the cars and buses are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dicreasing </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> the evening.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> people <ERR type=[vp6,s]> left </ERR> their home and went to the open air.
some people <ERR type=[vp6,s]> went </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> to </ERR> shopping or eating.
There are many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> school </ERR> in Xinxiang and there're two middle are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gook </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,4-]> school </ERR> in Henan <ERR type=[fm3,2-]> province </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> in </ERR> the north of my hometown, there're many beautiful mountains.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> because </ERR> we'll build our hometown in future.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> a </ERR> dog is a kind of animal, you can find it almost everywhere in the world.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> most </ERR> of them are liked by people.
They feed it and build a little house for it, they often play with the dog and teach it how to dance and how to play <ERR type=[fm1,-]> garmes </ERR> .Dogs can help people, because they can watch the door.
In the country, farmers like to keep dogs not only for pleasure, but also for <ERR type=[vp4,1-2]> watch </ERR> the door.
They can <ERR type=[wd3,2-4]> heap </ERR> farmers keep the door, room, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gruin </ERR> and so on.
In the city, <ERR type=[np6,2-s]> dog </ERR> also help people catch <ERR type=[fm1,-]> theif </ERR> .So dogs are really our friends.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s][wd3,-3]> in </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-2]> an </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Santurday </ERR> afternoon, all of the students in Grade <ERR type=[fm3,-]> one </ERR> of senior school had an English party.
There were English songs, plays, <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> speech </ERR> and so on.
These <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pogrammas </ERR> were all very good, but the one programme I was interested in was a speech <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> which </ERR> from Zhao Shanshan.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> were both interested in English.
I thought it could tell every <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> body </ERR> that my English was better than her .
I had never thought her English would be better, until I had <ERR type=[vp1,1-3]> listened </ERR> her English Speech.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> that time, I found she was better.
[wd4,-s] thought for a long time, I found it wasn't that I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> want </ERR> <ERR type=[cc6,1-1]> enough </ERR> clever, but I need one thing that she had.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> that's </ERR> guts.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> if </ERR> a person <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> have </ERR> ability, he wasn't only clever but also <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> have </ERR> guts.
<ERR type=[wd3,-s]> Of </ERR> you haven't guts, you will not find chance to get success.
If you aren't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cleaver </ERR> enough , you can't stand in the society.
So from now on, I'll work hard, at the same time I'll train my <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> guts </ERR> .
<ERR type=[vp6,-s]> I'm </ERR> be a useful person in the future.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> father is only a common person of China.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> doesn't know lots of knowledge and also can't speak deep <ERR type=[cc4,2-]> language </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> father </ERR> is very hard.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> his </ERR> family was very poor when he was young, so he had to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> word </ERR> early.
After many years, his face <ERR type=[vp6,s]> became </ERR> very black because of the sun's burning, and his two hands are very rough because of many years of hard work.
In <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> summer, the weather is so hot.
He still doesn't stop his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tow </ERR> hands.
In <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> winter.
The <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> mind </ERR> blows so large and cold , father's <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> hand </ERR> still continue to do something.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> I faced my father, I didn't know what I should do.
I'm sure I didn't <ERR type=[wd7,s]> describe </ERR> my feeling when <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> saw </ERR> the picture.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> father who is in the picture, <ERR type=[pr5,-]> his </ERR> thin and black face <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> likes </ERR> my father's very much.
Especially the eyes that <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> is </ERR> full of hope.
He only <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> hope </ERR> that his children will be useful to the society in the future.
Father's eyes told me that the road of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> live </ERR> is too long, and also taught me how to walk out my <ERR type=[wd7,s]> own </ERR> the life of road.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> a </ERR> young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> he got home, he went upstairs to his bedroom and put them on.
He went downstairs, where his mother and his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tow </ERR> <ERR type=[np3m2-1]> sister </ERR> were washing up the tea thing in the kitchen.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "these </ERR> new trousers are too long," he said, <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "they </ERR> need shortening by about two inches.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> his </ERR> mother and sister were busy and none of them said anything.
She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.Later <ERR type=[wd3.1-2]> in </ERR> , after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> she </ERR> was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly up <ERR type=[fm2,3-1]> stairs </ERR> without saying anything to anyone, and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The <ERR type=[wd3,d]> young </ERR> sister went to the cinema, but when she came in, she too, remembered what her brother had said.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> can imagine the look in the young man's face when he put the trousers on the next morning.
I'll never forget- the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> matter </ERR> that I sell books.
I remember that day when it <ERR type=[vp6,s]> is </ERR> July <ERR type=[fm1,-]> 23nd </ERR> 1995.
I collected some <ERR type=[wd5,2-4]> all </ERR> kinds of old books, from my friends and parents.
Decided to go to sell books <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> .at </ERR> 2 o'clock p.m.
I took the books with three of my friends to get <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> to </ERR> book-market.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> put a big piece of paper and put these books on the paper.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> a short while our old Book Market was full of people.
"Hill, <ERR type=[fm3,1-s]> How </ERR> much is this book-Beautiful Friend ?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> of the girls asked.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "two </ERR> Juan".
I <ERR type=[vp6,d]> answer </ERR> shyly.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "oh </ERR> , it's old.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> all it's my first time to be a seller.
Finally she spend <ERR type=[wd5,2-4]> paid </ERR> only 150 fen for it and went away happily.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> just </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,-]> there </ERR> a boy with glasses came up.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "what </ERR> can I do for you?
I turned it over and said <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "you </ERR> see the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fice </ERR> 3 yuan and you may pay only 2.5 yuan for it.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "well </ERR> can you make it a little cheaper!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "sorry </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> it's quite a nice book, isn't it?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> last he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paud </ERR> 2.5 yuan for it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> soon </ERR> 58 books had been sold and I myself sold 21 of them.
<ERR type=[fm3,-1]> how </ERR> wonderful!
I learned a lot from this practice and it can't be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> learnal </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,4-3]> fool </ERR> from text books.
What an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unforget </ERR> take <ERR type=[fm1,-]> experienle </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> hometown is <ERR type=[fm3,-]> LinZhou </ERR> city.
In town many <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> people are rich, but the village which is my hometown is very poor.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> village next to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ShanXi </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> province </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> there </ERR> are a lot of hills.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> on </ERR> the hills, many flowers and plants are grown.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> is </ERR> very beautiful place.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> often wear old clothes.
They eat potatoes and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> drind </ERR> porridge.
Last year, <ERR type=[wd7,2-4]> 2 </ERR> went to my hometown.
I met <ERR type=[np7,d]> the </ERR> family.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> later.
I like teacher and <ERR type=[wd1,4-1]> my </ERR> classmates.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-2]> the </ERR> girl cried.
"LiLi, you <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> are </ERR> good girl.
But our family <ERR type=[vp6,d]> was </ERR> so poor.
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> That </ERR> a pity!
I couldn't help crying and I <ERR type=[vp6,s]> give </ERR> them 50 yuan.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s]> knew </ERR> this is very little.
I hope all <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> people help <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> to </ERR> the girl.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> please </ERR> help that pity <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> girl </ERR> !
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> day, my brother and I decided to go fishing.
The river wasn't wide, but the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nater </ERR> was very clear and the river was rich in fishes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> what we saw there surprised us very much.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> instead </ERR> we saw rubbish every <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> where </ERR> on the surface of the river floated something dirty and dead fish.What's more, there was a foul smell.
We wondered how fish could <ERR type=[wd7,4-3]> lice </ERR> in such water.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> waited and waited.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> how </ERR> disappointed we were!
At last we couldn't stand the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> temible </ERR> smell any longer and had to go home.
<ERR type=[wd3,-3]> I </ERR> was awful that with the development of our industry <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> move </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,s]> and </ERR> more rivers were being polluted.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> must do some <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> thing </ERR> to prevent out rivers from being <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pollnted </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> two </ERR> years ago, I met a boy about seven years old.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> was always quiet.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> first I thought perhaps he was a quiet boy.
But soon I found he was as clever and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aetive </ERR> as the other <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> children.when </ERR> the summer holidays were over, I had to go back to my school and he was sent to a school for the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> handieapped </ERR> children.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> since </ERR> then I had never <ERR type=[vp6,d]> seen </ERR> him again.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> last </ERR> winter I happened to meet him again in the street.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> how </ERR> glad we were!
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> then </ERR> he "told" me that he was interested in drawing.
At last he "told" me a <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> secret </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> wanted to go to college when he finished middle school!
I'll never forget the day-May <ERR type=[fm1,-]> 23nd </ERR> , when I sold 21 books.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it's </ERR> really an unforgettable experience to me.
Pan Hao, chairman of the students' <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Urion </ERR> , called for us to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> orgainze </ERR> an old Book <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> Market </ERR> , I was the monitor of our class then.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> bell rang and school was over.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> a short while, our old book market was full of students.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> of the girls asked .
<ERR type=[fm3,-1]> "one </ERR> yuan.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "oh </ERR> , it's old.
It's worth 50 <ERR type=[wd7,3-3]> for </ERR> at the most.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> finally </ERR> she <ERR type=[wd3,1-s]> said </ERR> only 60 fen for it and went away happily.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> looking </ERR> at her, I said to myself, "I must be braver nest time.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "what </ERR> can I do for you?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "ah </ERR> , I want this cartoon book," he said.
I turned it over and said, <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "you </ERR> see, the price is $2.50 for <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> it </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> ""well </ERR> , can you make it a little cheaper?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "sorry </ERR> , but it's quite a nice book, isn't it?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> last he paid $2.50 for it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> soon </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> after </ERR> 58 books had been sold and I myself sold 21 of them.
I learned a lot from this practice and it can't be learned from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> teat </ERR> books.
What an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forgetable </ERR> experience!
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> dear </ERR> friend, did you <ERR type=[vp9,2-3]> gone </ERR> to Hong Kong?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> if </ERR> you go to Hong Kong by air .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> will arrive at Kat Tak Airport.
Because there was <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> no </ERR> enough land, this was built out in <ERR type=[fm2,s-]> to </ERR> the sea.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> only </ERR> a few kilometres from the people's Republic of China.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> can get there by ship or through a <ERR type=[fm3,2-]> Tunnel </ERR> under the sea.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> much </ERR> of Hong Kong is farm land and mountains.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> population of Hong Kong is over 4 million.
Chinese and English are spoken by many people there, clothes, computers, radios and TCS are made <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> on </ERR> Hong Kong.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> but </ERR> all kinds of things.
such as weathers <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> computers </ERR> are very cheap.
Hong Kong will be returned to <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> china </ERR> , welcome to Hong Kong!
LEARNING A <ERR type=[fm1,-]> LINGUAGE </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> in </ERR> school all over the world boys and girls are learning foreign languages.
It listens to what people say and it tries to imitate what it <ERR type=[vp6,s]> heard </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> is using the language.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> if </ERR> people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly.
But it is not enough only to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> memerize </ERR> rules from a grammar book.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> practice </ERR> is important.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> day , my brother and I decided to <ERR type=[vp1,1-1]> go </ERR> fish.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> some </ERR> years ago we often went fishing by a small river ten <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kilometors </ERR> away from my home.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> river wasn't wide but the water was very clear and the river was rich in fishes many fishing fans used to go there for a good catch.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> set off very early that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> merning </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> about seven o'clock we got to the river.
We couldn't find any people there <ERR type=[fm1,-]> istead </ERR> we saw rubbish everywhere.
On the surface of the river <ERR type=[fm1,-]> twated </ERR> something dirty and dead fish.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> what's </ERR> more, there was a foul smell.
We <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wordered </ERR> how fish can live in such water.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> waited and waited.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> how </ERR> disappointed we were!
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> last </ERR> Saturday, our grade <ERR type=[vp6,s]> hold </ERR> an interesting English Party.
The students <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> who </ERR> in our grade took part in it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> some </ERR> teachers who taught English in different grades took part in it, too.
In the party, the students <ERR type=[wd5,s]> who </ERR> in different classes <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> give </ERR> us some very good programmes.
Their good programmes <ERR type=[vp6,s]> make </ERR> everyone here very happy and glad.
Sometimes a student <ERR type=[fm1,-]> should </ERR> loudly <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> "well </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Done </ERR> !
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> sometimes </ERR> the teacher laughed, too.
After that I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> this party is very useful and very good for us.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> us were interested in English .
I hoped it could be <ERR type=[vp4,2-]> hold </ERR> every year.
I hoped it was more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> better </ERR> and better.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> long </ERR> long ago, my hometown was a very beautiful place.
There <ERR type=[vp6,d]> is </ERR> a river which was <ERR type=[cc4,3-]> light </ERR> and had kinds of fishes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> land which was by the side of the river of the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> soil </ERR> was very good.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> people </ERR> lived happily here.
They made the river become dirty and the river went <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> had </ERR> day after day.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> cut down trees, so that the soil <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> often </ERR> was washed into river by raining.
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> At </ERR> a result, the land was to <ERR type=[wd7,4-2]> good </ERR> than before.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> everything </ERR> in the town had changed.
The nature was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> destroied </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> .many </ERR> years later, a man <ERR type=[pr5,2-3]> which </ERR> was a scientist came here.
At first, the unknown men didn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> belive </ERR> him, but he didn't give up.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> by </ERR> his hard work .
People could <ERR type=[fm1,-]> belive </ERR> him and support him.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> then </ERR> the scientist made a fair programme.
A few years later, when the nature <ERR type=[vp6,s]> become </ERR> the best .
If you a <ERR type=[wd7,3-1]> boy </ERR> it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> crops grow ever better.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> every </ERR> morning .
I'm very happy, because it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> become </ERR> so beautiful.
I also <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> thank </ERR> the scientist to help us.I love my hometown!
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> day a Frenchman went to New York.
he took a taxi to a <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> hotel.the </ERR> day was Sunday.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> the Frenchman decided to go out for a walk.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> left the hotel and went out into the street.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> street was narrow and not very long.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "now </ERR> I know the name of this street, " he said to himself.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "and </ERR> I can get back to the hotel safely.
Then he felt tired and wanted to go <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bank </ERR> to his hotel.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> took the notebook out of his pocked and showed the name of the street to a young man .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> young man read the words in the Frenchman's notebook and looked at the Frenchman.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> what </ERR> does he want?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> stopped an old man and <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> wanted </ERR> him the words in his notebook.
But the old man didn't know <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> that </ERR> the Frenchman wanted.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> luckily </ERR> this sailor knew some French.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> these were the words in the Frenchman's notebook: one way street.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> her </ERR> parents bought it for her when she was eleven years old.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> colour was good and she <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> hide </ERR> wearing it very much.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> now it is too small to wear <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> it </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> she <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to get a <ERR type=[wd7,1-1]> man </ERR> one.
Yesterday she went to <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> shop </ERR> with her mother.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> she </ERR> looked at many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shirks </ERR> , but she <ERR type=[wd3,d]> was </ERR> not like them.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> she </ERR> said to her mother," I'll wear this shirt for another year, will you buy me two skirts <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nest </ERR> year"?
She liked a talking <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> tea </ERR> , so Mary bought a small electric machine, it could make tea and bought a small electric machine.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> could make tea and then wake you up in the morning.
She brought it <ERR type=[wd3,s]> is </ERR> her mother on her birthday and showed her how to use it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "before </ERR> you go to bed, put tea and water in it ," she explained to her mother," and don't forget to turn the electricity on.
" Chinese tea is the best tea in the world so many <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> of </ERR> people like to eat Chinese <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> tea </ERR> , also I like it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> a few days, the old lady telephoned her daughter and said, "Mary, there is one thing I do not understand: why do I have to go to bed to make tea?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> can't </ERR> I have tea in the afternoon or in the evening?
WHY DO I PLAY THE <ERR type=[fm1,-]> CLARICET </ERR>
I have found I had <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> interested </ERR> in playing it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> I was very young, there was a small field by the east to my home .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> we had finished our supper, my dad often took me <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> to </ERR> there, I found my dad often took a strange black <ERR type=[np3,3-]> things </ERR> every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> times </ERR> , and when I was playing, my dad was playing it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> that time, I only knew that <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> it's </ERR> name is "clarinet".
The actors of the party <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> all the girls in the whole!
If it had the boys were all <ERR type=[fm1,-]> appered </ERR> with another leading <ERR type=[np3,2-]> players </ERR> .
I was very sad at that time, so from then on, I wasn't willing to see the dance, the piano playing or the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> also </ERR> by girls and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> at </ERR> that time, I <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> think </ERR> "why do the boys couldn't put <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> on </ERR> and act the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> programmes </ERR> ?......Hmm!
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> day , I must mount on the stage, and tell the girls: <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> 'the </ERR> boys are also good on the stage!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> I was very young, I <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> had </ERR> interested in music very much.
At that time, I had no tape but my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> neighber </ERR> had one.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> I often went to his home and listened to the music.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> mother found I had interested in it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> she </ERR> bought a new tape for me.
I was very <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> happy.when </ERR> I was a pupil in Grade 4, my father had begun to teach me to play the clarinet.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> after more and more years, I found it was very interesting.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> because </ERR> I could <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> playing </ERR> many <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> songs.but </ERR> it isn't the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> importance </ERR> .
I found my diathesis have <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> improved </ERR> more and more.
I think that is the most <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> importance </ERR> .
At <ERR type=[wd7,1-3]> cast </ERR> , I must say, I have played the clarinet for 6 years, I must play it again and again.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> I have been <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> important actor in our school I think, the boys are also good on the stage!
IN SCHOOL BOYS AND GIRLS ARE LEARNING FOREIGN <ERR type=[fm1,-]> LAUGUAGES </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> do </ERR> you know how many <ERR type=[np3,3-]> language </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> these </ERR> are in the world?
<ERR type=[wd3,-s][fm3,-s]> these </ERR> are about one thousand five hundred, but many of them are not very important.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> millions </ERR> of boys and girls in schools are trying to do <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so.many </ERR> English children study French.
Russian, Japanese and <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> Chinese.which </ERR> is the best way to learn a language?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> it wants some <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> thing </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> is using the language, thinking in it and talking in it all the time: if people use a second language all the time, they will learn in quickly.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> is best to learn all new words through the ear.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> can read them spell them and write them later.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> water </ERR> is very important to living things .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> without </ERR> water there can be no life on the earth.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> all </ERR> animals and plants need water.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> water </ERR> covers most parts of the earth.
Water is found almost every <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> where </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> cannot see it or feel it when it is the part of air.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> water in the air is not a liquid but a gas.

They may also be made of snow <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> crystals </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> snow </ERR> <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> crystals </ERR> are little crystals of ice.

<ERR type=[np6,-1]> teacher </ERR> told me my text's result.
I didn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> past </ERR> that exam.
Saw the moon and wanted <ERR type=[wd7,s]> anything </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "did </ERR> my ideals break?
Because it retained my <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> sweat </ERR> .Several months <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> late </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> mother, my <ERR type=[wd4,4-4]> teacher </ERR> my classmates were very <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> happily </ERR> .I will never forget my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> follew's </ERR> season.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> was very bright though <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> it </ERR> just six o'clock.
I had to get up but I was so tired.There were many students <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> whom </ERR> were doing exercises when I got to the playground.
I took part in them to <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> sport.seven </ERR> to twenty was at <ERR type=[wd7,s]> breakfast </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[vp6,-]> drunk </ERR> some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> porride </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> and </ERR> a piece of bread.
[wd4,-3] Seven o'clock I have already <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> studied </ERR> in classroom.
Because Wang <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> sir </ERR> would <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> exam </ERR> us, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> so </ERR> every one tried his best to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> the text, and the classroom was filled with voice.
At mid <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> noon, </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> returned </ERR> the classroom soon as I had <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> eaten </ERR> lunch.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> text </ERR> of the end term was coming nearly and <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> nearly </ERR> , I had to work hard in order to get a good <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> set </ERR> in class, though I was so tired for it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> after </ERR> 1:5 <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> hours </ERR> I thought I had better have a rest, so I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> vent </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> to </ERR> bed-room to sleep for a <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> while.In </ERR> afternoon we had PE class.

<ERR type=[fm3,3-2]> Terrible </ERR> , full day it was today?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s][vp6,-s]> did </ERR> you think so?
I <ERR type=[vp6,d]> thought </ERR> so.
[wd4,-2] GOOD TEACHER
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> I was a primary school pupil.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> is my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mathes </ERR> teacher my classmates and I often talked about <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> he </ERR> after class.
Because <ERR type=[pp1,1-s]> of </ERR> he has a serious face.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> that </ERR> many be so .One day "doing...... the alarm of the clock <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> wake </ERR> me up.
On my way to school it began to rain hard.When I got to the door of <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> the </ERR> our class room .
I was all <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> wit </ERR> and shivering with cold.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> our </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mathes </ERR> teacher had already <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gegun </ERR> his lesson.
It was a Mr Wu <ERR type=[pr1,-]> he </ERR> was about fifty years old.
" With these words he quickly took off his own jacket and quickly handed it to me "Now take off your wet coat and put this one on <ERR type=[wd5,-]> to </ERR> you'll get ill?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> said kindly.I went to my seat with my <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> teachers </ERR> jacket it was a bit big for me but I felt very warm in it to my surprise, I found for the first time, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mathes </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> was </ERR> became so interesting and how well I couldn't forgot it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> was an old man but he was very healthy.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> always had a strange way to make his lessons interesting.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> with </ERR> the help of him, we had made progress.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> grammar is <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> improve </ERR> , but I find idioms and useful expressions hard to learn.
"Mr Wang said with a kind <ERR type=[fm1,-]> voise </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> "not </ERR> really.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> often </ERR> the little words have meanings of their own, you should learn them by heart.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> you don't understand <ERR type=[pr3]> it </ERR> , you can try to guess the meaning from the rest of the sentence.
" I heard what he said and then asked, <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "but </ERR> how to <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> use </ERR> English language?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> "do </ERR> you know the story of Karl Marx ?
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> said, "Marx could master many foreign <ERR type=[np3,2-]> language </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> in </ERR> one of his books .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> if </ERR> they do this, it shows they haven't mastered it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> they use the foreign language, they should try to forget all about their own.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> if </ERR> they cannot do this, they have not really learned the spirit of the foreign language and cannot use it freely.
He <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> nan </ERR> Normal University
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> now </ERR> , I tell you something about my home town.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> home town's name is Xin <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> xiang </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> is in the east of He <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> nan </ERR> and is not far from Zheng <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> zhou </ERR> .
Though <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> it </ERR> smaller than Zheng <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> zhou </ERR> .
because it is very <ERR type=[wd6,-]> very </ERR> beautiful.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> has hills and rivers.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> has flowers everywhere.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> markets here <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> sold </ERR> peas, carrots, potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes, apples, pears oranges, chicken, pork, beef, fish, and so on.
I like eating fish very much, but I never buy fish in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> marked </ERR> .
On Sunday, I and family often <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> "fishing </ERR> by the river <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> band </ERR> and we cook it ourselves.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> by </ERR> the river bank, there are a lot of <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> trees, </ERR> the trees have a lot of fruit in autumn.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> home town has many busy noisy roads that make the town lively.
Kate, what about your home <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> town </ERR> ?
Best wishes.Yours <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> wen </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> the </ERR> Chinese people will never forget the biggest earthquake in Tang <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> shan </ERR> , in 1976.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> houses </ERR> and tall buildings fell down.
I was having my summer holidays with my uncle in Tang <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> shan </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> uncle got me out at once.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> our neighbours were not as lucky as we were.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> were killed in the <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> earthquake.today </ERR> , we have rebuilt Tang <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> shan </ERR> and made it more beautiful.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> I do hope we can do some <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> thing </ERR> later to stop earthquakes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> one </ERR> day, my brother and I decided to go fishing.
Some years ago we <ERR type=[wd5,1-s]> after </ERR> went fishing by a small river ten kilometers away from my home.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s][wd7,-s]> had </ERR> the river was rich in fishes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> what we saw there surprised us very much.
We <ERR type=[wd4,d]> could </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fund </ERR> any <ERR type=[fm1,-]> 0eople </ERR> there.
<ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-s]> instand </ERR> we saw rubbish every <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> where </ERR> .
On the surface of the river floated some <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> thing </ERR> dirty and dead fish.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> how </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disappouned </ERR> we were!
It was awful that with the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> derelopment </ERR> of our industry, more and more rivers were being polluted .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> we </ERR> must do something to prevent our rivers from being polluted.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> when </ERR> I was young, I'd listen to the radio, waiting for my favorite songs.
When they played I'd sing <ERR type=[cc5,1-]> along </ERR> , it <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> make </ERR> me smile.Those were such happy times and not so long ago.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> how </ERR> I wondered where they'd gone.
It can really make <ERR type=[pr4,1-1]> my </ERR> cry.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> just </ERR> like me.
Looking back on how it was in years gone by , and the good <ERR type=[wd7,3-3]> tomes </ERR> that I had makes today <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> seen </ERR> rather sad.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> much has changed.
Now I <ERR type=[vp6,s][wd4,-]> changed </ERR> a serious girl, with <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> out </ERR> smile on my face.
I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> hoped </ERR> that I could go back to before, but I can't.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> what </ERR> should I do?
I <ERR type=[vp6,d]> needed </ERR> help very much.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> gave me a good idea.
Now, I <ERR type=[vp6,-][pp1,-]> change </ERR> a ripe girl.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> my </ERR> life <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> are </ERR> full of <ERR type=[wd2,-]> live </ERR> .
THE <ERR type=[wd4,-]> FAMOUS </ERR> OF <ERR type=[fm1,-]> WOULDS </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> there </ERR> are three of the biggest man-made projects in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> would </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> they </ERR> are the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt and the Aswan High Dam which is also in Egypt.First, the Great Wall of China was built during the Qi and the Ming periods.
In those periods, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Emperox </ERR> and Empress had made lots of labour force to build the defence line in order to resist the foreign <ERR type=[np6,s-]> invader </ERR> .
They didn't know the <ERR type=[wd2,2-3]> live </ERR> of the people in country <ERR type=[cc1,-]> city </ERR> , town and <ERR type=[np6,2-]> village </ERR> .After that, many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> peasant </ERR> had <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rase </ERR> up <ERR type=[pp1,-]> during </ERR> every year.
What a <ERR type=[cc7,2-2]> pity </ERR> of them!
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> because </ERR> of the wars during the period, most of the Qi Wall was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> distoried </ERR> by people.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> during </ERR> the Ming period, the Emperor <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> made </ERR> people building the great Wall.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> the Great Wall which you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> looked </ERR> at is bigger and longer <ERR type=[fm1,-]> then </ERR> the Qi Great Wall.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> today </ERR> , the Great Wall <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> from Shan <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> hai </ERR> to Jia <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> yu </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> there </ERR> are lots of nations <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> people </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> lived </ERR> there and they were growing many plants for their life.
I love the Great Wall, because it solidified the wisdom and <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> hard-working </ERR> of the Chinese.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> everybody </ERR> , I think you all know the Chinese history.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> yes </ERR> , China is a very.
very great country, which is one of the oldest of <ERR type=[wd7,-]> fours </ERR> in the world.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> now </ERR> , I want to talk some <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> thing </ERR> about China.
<ERR type=[wd5,-4]> At </ERR> about 1,700,000 years ago <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Chine </ERR> had already had the people, which were called Yuan <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> Mou </ERR> people.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> as </ERR> their life, it was <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> lasted </ERR> very long time.In the 2100s BC, one people who <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> called </ERR> Qi had <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> built </ERR> Xia <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> period </ERR> , which was the first <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> period </ERR> in China.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> was the first slavery country.
It disappeared in about 770- 476BC, which <ERR type=[wd4,-1-5]> contained </ERR> Xia, <ERR type=[fm3,1-2]> sheng </ERR> Zhou <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> periods </ERR> and so <ERR type=[fm3,-s]> on.in </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> 475-221 BC, China built the other <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> period </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> which </ERR> <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> called </ERR> Zhan <ERR type=[fm2,1-1]> Guo </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> period </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it </ERR> was the first Feng <ERR type=[fm2,1-1]> Jian </ERR> country.

There <ERR type=[vp6,d]> are </ERR> many people.
<ERR type=[wd4,-]> Some </ERR> workers, some students of university .
& some <ERR type=[vp6,d]> are </ERR> high school's students.
Most of them <ERR type=[vp6,d]> are </ERR> youth.
And they <ERR type=[vp6,d]> speak </ERR> English very well.
But my vocabulary ?and y| is so poor that I just <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heared </ERR> a litter.
After a while, a , am <ERR type=[vp6,1-]> come </ERR> toward us & <ERR type=[vp6,d]> talk </ERR> with us.
As my friend is in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Gread </ERR> 2, her English is better than me .
So she <ERR type=[vp6,d]> talk </ERR> much more with the man than me.
Now, I must <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> tried </ERR> to speak more and more.
But my homework is so <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> much </ERR> that I can't go to see you.

This week I had two <ERR type=[np3m1-]> exam </ERR> , one is English, the other is Physics.
But the marks <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> was </ERR> very low.
I was so careless that I lost many marks in easy <ERR type=[np6,s-]> question </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> in </ERR> English exam.
On the other hand, my physical <ERR type=[wd4,s-][wd7,2-]> base </ERR> too poor to work out those problems.
It was important that we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> have </ERR> three exams.
Because my results <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> has </ERR> never been so low before.
And I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fough </ERR> the time was too limited to do other homework.
At first, Miss Lin asked some <ERR type=[np3,d]> student </ERR> to act out the lesson ?
How <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> funny </ERR> they portrayed!
After them, the second group was six <ERR type=[np3,1-]> girl </ERR> and a mischievous boy.
At the end of the class, Miss Lin let us <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> listen </ERR> two English songs.
One <ERR type=[vp6,d][wd4,2-2]> is </ERR> romantic song, the other <ERR type=[vp6,d]> is </ERR> Disni's.

In <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> stead </ERR> , she tried to console me, saying that she sometimes would <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> met </ERR> the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> setback </ERR> too.
Here, I thank her <ERR type=[wd2,3-1]> wholehearted </ERR> and give her the best wishes.
I have three likes, <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> listening </ERR> music, collecting stamps and reading <ERR type=[np6,1-]> novel </ERR> .

But it took us a long time to make a fire, so we only <ERR type=[vp6,d]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,1-3]> a </ERR> hour to cook.
But we seldom <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> cooking </ERR> at home, so we cooked very badly.

The thing is: Next <ERR type=[wd7,1-s]> friend </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thve </ERR> will begin the second-class activities.
But now I don't <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> choose </ERR> whether I will join the English class or not.
The question is I like English, and I want to enter <ERR type=[np7,s-]> the </ERR> institute of foreign languages.
I <ERR type=[vp6,d]> worried </ERR> my English because of the low result.
When I was in the middle school, most of my English result is <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> on </ERR> 90 or more, but now I <ERR type=[vp6,d]> did </ERR> not try to <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> be </ERR> on 90.
Last night was a funny night because we went to a game place and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> have </ERR> a good time.
And I <ERR type=[vp6,d]> want </ERR> to go there greatly.
There were so many <ERR type=[np3,2-]> game-machine </ERR> that there were many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> child </ERR> with their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perants </ERR> .
Then we paid some money for the <ERR type=[np6,s-]> coin </ERR> and began to <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> shut </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> he </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> let </ERR> the coin to enter a basket in the game machine.
Because of that, we got fifty <ERR type=[np3,1-]> piece </ERR> of lottery tickets.
I went to another side to grip <ERR type=[np6,1-]> thing </ERR> .
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> consin </ERR> gave me lottery tickets enough to change <ERR type=[cc3,-]> award </ERR> .
They <ERR type=[vp6,d]> were </ERR> very interesting.
It was a nervous and senseless <ERR type=[cc4,4-]> day </ERR> .
It was <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> completely </ERR> because of the exams.
There will be four exams <ERR type=[wd5,s-2]> in </ERR> next week, English, Maths, Physics and History.
They will <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> come </ERR> after another.
The last two day's situation was: everywhere was my books, and the paper <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> can </ERR> be seen here and there.
Though that, I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> don't </ERR> finish going over them until now.
All about it can't prove me is a diligent student , <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> it </ERR> only because I put everything that I will go over to do on Saturday and Sunday .
Long <ERR type=[wd6,-]> long </ERR> , there was <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> emperor.
One day, two <ERR type=[np3,1-]> cheat </ERR> who called <ERR type=[fm1,-]> themself </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> weaver </ERR> came to see the emperor.
The emperor was very <ERR type=[cc4,4-]> pleasant </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[np6,d]> cheat </ERR> began to work.
They <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> pretended </ERR> hardworking.
In fact, there is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nother </ERR> except two empty looms in their room.
Some <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> day </ERR> passed, the emperor sent the Prime Minister to the cheats' room and see clothes.
But the man <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> looked </ERR> nothing.
However, when he got back, he told the emperor the clothes which he had seen <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> was </ERR> very beautiful and he had never seen such fine clothes.
Surely he got a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> game </ERR> answer.
The two <ERR type=[np3,2-]> cheat </ERR> pretended to help the foolish man to try it.
Then the elated man <ERR type=[vp6,d]> march </ERR> in procession with nothing on.
Today I saw a strange <ERR type=[np5,2-3]> news </ERR> in a newspaper.
There was a young <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> modal </ERR> named Anna <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> in </ERR> .
Her inborn condition was very good, so many people <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> liked </ERR> her playing fashionable and dancing.
And she was greatly long for the future, <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> dreamed </ERR> of being one of the best models in the world.
But before long, her right face suddenly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gotanged </ERR> ill.
Her former beautiful <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fact </ERR> shrank by degrees, and <ERR type=[wd1,1-2]> appeared </ERR> many wrinkles.
Saw her from right , she <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> liked </ERR> an old woman whose age was seventy, saw her from <ERR type=[wd3,s]> lift </ERR> , she still was a young girl.
It <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> make </ERR> her very <ERR type=[cc6,4-]> pain </ERR> .
She thought those fine dreams <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> what </ERR> she had ever had were broken at all.
Why she <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> fell </ERR> such an illness, the doctor could not find out the reason, either.
Sunny, Dec <ERR type=[fm2,-]> 31th </ERR> Sunny
There are always strange <ERR type=[np3,4-3]> thing </ERR> in the world.

He found a veterinarian to see it, but there <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> no result.
Because from ancient times to <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> modern </ERR> , countless great <ERR type=[np3,2-]> writer </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> enjoyed </ERR> it and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> writed </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> lot </ERR> of poems and words win universal praise to eulogize it .
In the history, plum blossoms was <ERR type=[wd3,-]> ever </ERR> elected to be the flower of our country.

He <ERR type=[vp6,d]> give </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> order to look for the two cheats.
When he found them, he asked to make <ERR type=[np7,s-]> a </ERR> same <ERR type=[fm1,-]> clother </ERR> for his Prime Minister.
Though doing nothing, the two cheats <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> was </ERR> given some gold.
Then the Prime Minister was <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> force </ERR> to put on the clothes that the emperor made for him, and walked in the middle of another <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> precession </ERR> .
After that, the old man felt shy greatly, he asked for going <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> hometown </ERR> .
From then on, no official <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> dared </ERR> to tell lie to the emperor.
So we <ERR type=[wd3,d]> found </ERR> everywhere.
<ERR type=[pr5,-s]> When </ERR> was the key?
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> In </ERR> that morning.
Until tonight, I have just <ERR type=[vp6,s]> found </ERR> Chenyin and gave her the key.

Seeing from down to <ERR type=[pp2,4-]> up </ERR> , you can see a piece of <ERR type=[cc1,3-]> steam </ERR> even in Summer.
It is on a mountain which is named Yuping <ERR type=[fm3,3-]> feng </ERR> .
It is <ERR type=[wd2,-]> elevation </ERR> 1700 metres.
When Summer comes, it will <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> frozes </ERR> .
And the weather is <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hoter </ERR> , the ice is more <ERR type=[aj3,2-]> thicker </ERR> .
And the people who drink the water from the hold are long <ERR type=[wd2,-]> life </ERR> .
Till now, no one can <ERR type=[wd7,-]> till </ERR> the solution to <ERR type=[np7,1-4]> a </ERR> riddle of this hole.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> it's </ERR> mysterious and fascinating.
If I could have three <ERR type=[np3,2-]> hope </ERR> like Aladdin, the first one is I can see the film completely.
It was September 30th, the day before October <ERR type=[fm1,-]> 1th </ERR> --the National Day.
After 9 o'clock, <ERR type=[fm3,3-2]> Suddenly </ERR> a noise came up, and the sky was <ERR type=[vp9,3-2]> begun </ERR> shining by <ERR type=[wd4,-]> the </ERR> .
And the story of it is <ERR type=[aj4,s-]> moved </ERR> .
At first, you will feel it mysterious and <ERR type=[wd3,-]> calm </ERR> .
When you <ERR type=[vp6,d]> entered </ERR> it deeper, you will find it <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> terror </ERR> .
And when you read the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> truth </ERR> , you will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wrooy </ERR> about the hero and heroine.

Let us catch <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> time </ERR> together to study!
Each of them <ERR type=[vp6,d]> is </ERR> so happy that I couldn't help thinking of my childhood.
During those days I needn't wrong about my <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> study </ERR> , my test and the mark.
But now I am living in a nervous <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> period </ERR> .
Plenty of exercises, lots of test, almost every two days we would have <ERR type=[np7,s-1]> the </ERR> test.
Though it is dull, I hope I can pass the period fast and well and I can enter the <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> University </ERR> that I want to.
Do you have some <ERR type=[np6,1-]> bookmark </ERR> ?
In fact, <ERR type=[np6,-3]> bookmark </ERR> is very useful.
And most <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,3-]> bookmark </ERR> are beautiful.
There are some beautiful <ERR type=[np6,2-]> picture </ERR> and wonderful words on <ERR type=[pr3,d]> it </ERR> .
So I like <ERR type=[np6,3-]> bookmark </ERR> very much.

The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Profressor </ERR> And His Invention
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Profressor </ERR> Hunter was very excited <ERR type=[wd3,s-1]> the </ERR> morning, because he had completed the papers <ERR type=[fm1,-]> off </ERR> his new invention which everyone would benefit from <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> it </ERR> .
He decided to give <ERR type=[pr3,d]> it </ERR> to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goverment </ERR> .
They said they were just the right men coming <ERR type=[wd3,s-1]> for </ERR> London.
As they looked too nervous and were too fast to <ERR type=[cc6,-]> leave </ERR> , the professor didn't believe them.
Shortly after that, the police <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> telephone </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> told </ERR> that the two government <ERR type=[fm1,-]> officials's </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,3-]> card </ERR> had been stopped and their cards had been stolen.
Because he had known that before, he gave them <ERR type=[fm1,-]> papars </ERR> that <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> isn't </ERR> about the invention.
Almost <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> of </ERR> every <ERR type=[fm1,-]> subjust </ERR> has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> homewords </ERR> and exercises.
For example reading some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> novel </ERR> and listening to the radio.
Today is the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forth </ERR> day of this holiday.
I must treasure the leaving <ERR type=[cc4,-]> day </ERR> off this short holiday to do everything that I want and make these days happy.
When you <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> walks </ERR> on the streets, you'll find everyone who is walking <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> have </ERR> many bags with <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> them </ERR> , small or big, with smiles on their <ERR type=[np3,s-]> faces </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Their </ERR> are <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> uninterruptedly </ERR> people in the shop which sells food, wine and so on.
And in the fashion shop, the <ERR type=[np3,1-2]> customer </ERR> are talking over the price with the shopkeeper.
If you feel <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> interest </ERR> in having a walk to the flower <ERR type=[fm1,-]> maket </ERR> , you'll see all kinds of <ERR type=[np3,4-]> flower </ERR> are on sale.
To your joy, you can buy many different kinds of <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> joy </ERR> , too.
It's so <ERR type=[cc4,s]> happy </ERR> to have a Spring Festival.
When you are walking in the yearly flower <ERR type=[fm1,-]> maket </ERR> , you will see a lovely kind of flower -- hung-clock flower.

It's said if every bud has eight <ERR type=[np3,1-]> flower </ERR> , it will <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> brings </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> lucky </ERR> .
The flowers <ERR type=[cc6,-]> open </ERR> downward.

No Word In <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> Deeply </ERR> Love
It is a very <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> move </ERR> story.
When he was a soldier in Fujian, he <ERR type=[vp2,-4]> made </ERR> friend with another soldier who came <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> from </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Eastnorth </ERR> of China.
There was <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> deeply </ERR> friendship.
Once after they finished a task under the <ERR type=[wd4,s]> sea, </ERR> other soldiers came back, the bank.
But his good friend was fast asleep at the bottom of the sea for <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> ever </ERR> .
At that time he kept staring <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> to </ERR> the sea for a long time.
Before he came in, he cried: "Mum, I has <ERR type=[vp9,2-1]> come </ERR> back.
And he would go to <ERR type=[wd2,4-2]> faraway </ERR> to see another mother.
His love gave her the courage of living, and his love <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> move </ERR> himself too.
In the hard to say pain, there is the hard to <ERR type=[fm2,4-]> say </ERR> happiness.
When I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> write </ERR> weekly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dairly </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> in </ERR> the first time, I was very happy.
Because it <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> is </ERR> a strange thing in my mind, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> so </ERR> I was very <ERR type=[wd2,4-2]> pleasure </ERR> in doing that.
But when time passed, I <ERR type=[vp1,1-4]> felt </ERR> it getting more and more troublesome to write <ERR type=[np7,2-1]> an </ERR> composition.
However, it's our task to improve the <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> can </ERR> of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> writting </ERR> composition.
And I must to <ERR type=[vp9,2-2]> learn </ERR> how to use the words and expression freely.
You must have wanted to know me <ERR type=[cc5,2-]> deeply </ERR> .
Now, let me tell you about the school in which I <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> studies </ERR> .
And there are two teaching <ERR type=[np3,2-]> building </ERR> , one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> liberary </ERR> , eight labs and a living-building in it.
And there are also some <ERR type=[wd4,-]> elective </ERR> .
such as computer language and <ERR type=[wd7,-]> coping </ERR> .
Hold this good <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> choice </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> and </ERR> we'll send the five final winners an English-Chinese dictionary.
It is for some time that I haven't <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> write </ERR> to you.
I think I learn Chinese, <ERR type=[fm3,2-3]> Maths </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm3,4-2]> History </ERR> better than other <ERR type=[np6,s-]> subject </ERR> .
On the contrary, I am worried about <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> Physics </ERR> and English class.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Especialy </ERR> the reading <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comprehesion </ERR> and the <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> written </ERR> in English.
And have you any books about the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exerises </ERR> of them.

Well, <ERR type=[fm3,1-s]> Would </ERR> you tell me of your situation?
Best <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Wishes </ERR> !

For example preparation, taking notes and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> reviewtion </ERR> .
And he also <ERR type=[vp6,d]> tell </ERR> me to read aloud every day and do a lot of reading.

He studies hard and <ERR type=[vp3,4-2]> do </ERR> well in physics.

All of us <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> likes </ERR> him very much.
It was nearly <ERR type=[wd4,4-3]> 30 </ERR> centigrade this afternoon for I saw about seven or eight children swimming in the river.
The last time I swam was about ten years ago <ERR type=[pp1,-s]> during </ERR> I spent my holiday in Beijing.
Sunday <ERR type=[fm3,2-]> cloudy </ERR>
It'll soon be New Year, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> a </ERR> lot of shops reduced the price to sell the goods.
It was <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> marked </ERR> down by 50%, 30% ...
<ERR type=[np3,-1]> This </ERR> ideas were very useful, for example a shop of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bossini </ERR> was <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> marked </ERR> down by 50% so that the people must in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> batched </ERR> enter.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> belived </ERR> this landscape is the only one of its kind <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> on </ERR> the modern years.
As a matter of fact this a urge <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> results </ERR> , many shops were kick upstairs or early raise late <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> mark </ERR> down, in fact didn't reduce the price .
Before soon, the Yicheng night paper also wrote about it and criticized this <ERR type=[wd7,-]> amiss </ERR> and unsuitable <ERR type=[np3,4-]> things </ERR> .
[wd4,-2] Saturday afternoon, mother brought me a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nroden </ERR> radio.
[fm3,-] for my birthday I'm very happy and say "Thank you, my mother.
" This radio isn't <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> a </ERR> ordinary radio.
It is the first that I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> saw </ERR> .
It's <ERR type=[fm3,1-2]> Functions </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> was </ERR> most.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> a </ERR> lot of functions that I ever knew <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> example </ERR> .
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-s]> had </ERR> a function <ERR type=[vp4,4-2]> call </ERR> "read again" though I researched a long time at last, I know it mean .
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> mean </ERR> when you listen once if you didn't listen <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> clear </ERR> and want to listen again .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> wouldn't put in the "Rew".
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> you </ERR> only put on "read <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> again", </ERR> radio can read again and again if you listen <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> clear </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> only </ERR> put on the "play" .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> radio </ERR> can read the next word.
It is most <ERR type=[aj3,3-2]> colder </ERR> than yesterday, but we are very happy.
The dinner was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> weathly </ERR> .
When the <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> dinner </ERR> finished, it was <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> night </ERR> o'clock.
After a <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> while, </ERR> uncle took out a birthday cake and said: "Let's sing a birthday song to father, <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> Ok </ERR> ?
" My father smiled and we put the cake on his face, the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> fair </ERR> also had it this time, gather turned off <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> old man, so we couldn't <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> smiling </ERR> and called him grandfather.
"Haha, haha..." The smile came from my home now and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thin </ERR> .
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fiamly </ERR> <ERR type=[cc5,-5]> dropped </ERR> into the middle of <ERR type=[np7,-]> smile </ERR> .
Now it is <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> night </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,3-]> O'clock </ERR> , I just get up.
After a while, when I'm having the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> baskfast </ERR> , the doorbell <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> rang </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> no one answers.
Then I go and open the door, however, I couldn't see anything, So I close the door and <ERR type=[wd7,-]> to </ERR> on with my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> baskfast </ERR> .
While I sit down, the bell <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rant </ERR> again.
Often the <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> door </ERR> , but could see nothing <ERR type=[sn8,s-.> again </ERR>
If they can use this time to make our <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> homeland </ERR> and do some useful things for people, then, our homeland will become stronger and <ERR type=[cc4,s-]> polite </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> but </ERR> the better <ERR type=[fm1,-]> impotant </ERR> is their lives also <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> became </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> instrutive </ERR> .
Teachers usually say: " It is important to <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> listen </ERR> and read English.
For this, I often listen to some English songs when I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> free.
An English song I <ERR type=[vp1,1-1][vp6,s]> listened </ERR> it again and again, but I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> didn't </ERR> understand the meaning, only can <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> hear </ERR> some words.
But when I read the songs <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> paper </ERR> , almost all <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> of </ERR> words I <ERR type=[wd5,-]> both </ERR> understand, and the meaning I also understand.
But I will not give up <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> listening </ERR> English songs, because they are very good, and I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> belive </ERR> I can understand <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> it </ERR> one day.
After <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> a </ERR> time he began to go out again, but he felt even more lonely without his friend, the dog.
He decided to <ERR type=[vp5,3-1]> looked </ERR> for a better hiding-place because he thought there <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> must </ERR> be someone else on the island.
At last, he found out <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> that </ERR> two eyes <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> was </ERR> the goat's.
He went towards the fire, he found a human <ERR type=[np4,4-1]> being </ERR> bones.
If someone <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> asked </ERR> me: "What color do you like?
" I'll <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> said </ERR> : "I like blue.
In the blue sky, <ERR type=[np7,-s> cloud </ERR> floats here and there.
When I <ERR type=[vp2,-3]> catch </ERR> sight off blue, I'll also think of sea, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bonndles </ERR> sea.
A long time ago, the town of Altorf in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Swilzerland </ERR> was ruled by Austria.
One day, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> Tell, a famous hunter, came to Altorf with his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> litter </ERR> son.
In the marketplace, there was a pole where a hat in the top of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> Tell </ERR> saw the pole, but he would have none of it.
Even before the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> crud </ERR> governor himself <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> and his son did not bow.
He <ERR type=[vp4,1-5]> picking </ERR> an apple from a tree.
He ordered the soldier to take the boy one hundred paces down the street and to place the apple with one of his <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> arrows </ERR> .
Without saying a word, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> drew two arrows.
" The boy turned around and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> face </ERR> his father.
Slowly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> Tell raised the bow, and after taking careful aim, let the arrow fly.
The story of the bravery of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> Tell and his son quickly got round throughout Switzerland.
This is the <ERR type=[wd3,d]> twenty-six </ERR> session, and <ERR type=[wd5,-]> also </ERR> the Olympic Games was <ERR type=[cc2,4-]> born </ERR> one hundred <ERR type=[wd4,-]> years </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> so </ERR> this session <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> very important <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> and </ERR> far-reaching historical significance.
Though I can't see all of the opening ceremony, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> but </ERR> I can feel the front how great and grand sight.
From the player's face, we can see the players are <ERR type=[wd6,3-3]> are </ERR> in high spirits and very nervous <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> in </ERR> the same time.
I think that must have a <ERR type=[cc4,-]> sharp </ERR> match.
Today is my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mather's </ERR> birthday.
The dinner was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> weathly </ERR> and very expensive.
After a <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> while, </ERR> brother took out a birthday cake and said: "Let's sing a birthday song to mother.
" "Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you..." My mother smiled and we put the cake in front of her face, the fair also had <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> it </ERR> , this time, mother turned off <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> old woman, so we couldn't <ERR type=[vp9,3-2]> smiling </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp9,5-2]> calling </ERR> her grand-mother.
"Haha haha..." The <ERR type=[cc1,-1]> smile </ERR> sound came from my home now and then.
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fimaly </ERR> dropped into the middle of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> happy </ERR> .
If someone <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> asked </ERR> me: " What color do you like?
When I catch sight of blue, I'll think of sky, the wide <ERR type=[cc4,2-]> sky </ERR> .
In the blue sky, <ERR type=[np7,-]> cloud </ERR> floats here and there, <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> give </ERR> me some daydream and self is so <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> little </ERR> .
When I catch sight of blue, I'll also think of sea, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bonndles </ERR> sea.
Let me remember some spirits <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> story </ERR> and I want to see the foot of sea.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Olypic </ERR> Games <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> twenty-six </ERR> session, today was <ERR type=[wd2,-]> end </ERR> .
On the closing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cermony </ERR> , all the <ERR type=[np3,2-]> player </ERR> came into the football ground and began to dance.
All of the <ERR type=[np3,3-1]> spectator </ERR> stood up to dance.
On the ground have more than one hundred <ERR type=[fm2,s-]> country's </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,s-]> player </ERR> .
Some of <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> them </ERR> singing, <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> Some </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> them </ERR> dancing, some of <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> them </ERR> exchanging the keepsake.
This time from their <ERR type=[np3,2-]> face </ERR> only can see <ERR type=[fm2,-]> happyly </ERR> .
But to my surprise, in the Beijing <ERR type=[fm3,3-]> road </ERR> have many people here and there .
Why today so strange that I can't <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> asking </ERR> myself sn8,s-] .
The next Friday <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> is </ERR> middle autumn <ERR type=[fm3,4-]> day </ERR> so many people go to the shop <ERR type=[fm1,-]> by </ERR> some <ERR type=[np5,-]> foods </ERR> OH!
I'm very <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> happily </ERR> <ERR type=[wd6,3-1]> happily </ERR> on that <ERR type=[wd6,2-]> that </ERR> !
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Saterday </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> afternoon, </ERR> mother brought me a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> morden </ERR> radio.
<ERR type=[vp6,d]> I'm </ERR> very happy and <ERR type=[vp6,d]> say </ERR> , "Thank you, my dear mother.

It is the first that I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> saw </ERR> .
It's functions <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> was </ERR> most.
A lot of functions that I never knew example : it <ERR type=[vp6,d]> had </ERR> a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> functions </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> call </ERR> "read again" though I <ERR type=[wd3,s-][wd4,-3]> researched </ERR> a long time.
At last, I <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> know </ERR> it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> mean </ERR> .
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> mean </ERR> when you listen once if you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> didn't </ERR> listen <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> clear </ERR> or want to listen again .
You wouldn't put on the <ERR type=[wd7,-]> "Rew" </ERR> , you only put on "read <ERR type=[wd7,-]> again" </ERR> .
In the blue sky, <ERR type=[np7,-]> cloud </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fhoats </ERR> here and there, <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> give </ERR> me some daydream and self is so little.
When I catch sight of blue, I'll also think of sea, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bonndles </ERR> sea.
In the blue sea, full of my <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> stery </ERR> .
Let me remember some spirits <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> story </ERR> and I want to see the foot of sea.

<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> these </ERR> are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frist </ERR> to do.
Because he spoke so fast that we couldn't <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> help </ERR> let put surprised voice .
for example, swimming, playing table tennis, tennis, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> valleyball </ERR> .
So I like to watch sports <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> match </ERR> too.
Because <ERR type=[cc2,-2]> sports </ERR> can make friends and improve friendship.
It can make me excited and I also <ERR type=[ad2,2-2]> very </ERR> enjoy it.

If you do so, you will make progress in listening and <ERR type=[wd4,s-1]> improve </ERR> study.
For this, I often listen to some English songs when I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> free.
At first, I can't <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> listen </ERR> a word of the song, but I can <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> listen </ERR> some words now.

<ERR type=[fm3,-]> friend </ERR>
A lot of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gratulations </ERR> have become famous people.
Many trees surround the <ERR type=[np6,d]> building </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> of </ERR> school.
The school <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> two teaching <ERR type=[np3,2-]> building </ERR> and a lab building.
<ERR type=[wd3,-4]> At </ERR> the May 14th afternoon, a student of senior two picked up a pair of blue sport trousers on the play ground.
There is a wallet <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> on </ERR> one pocket and keys <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> on </ERR> the other.
He <ERR type=[wd4,1-5][vp1,1-5]> handed </ERR> in the office of senior two.
What could you think of <ERR type=[vp1,2-3]> expect </ERR> the cool water .
I'll think of the sea <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> what </ERR> colour is blue and very bright and clean.
When I think of blue, the sky will appear <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> on </ERR> my head.
This term had <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> started </ERR> for three weeks.
[cc5,0-5] Our learning is very busy.
But I still very <ERR type=[cc5,1-]> missed </ERR> my old friends.
We had <ERR type=[fm1,-]> taoked </ERR> for a long time.
Next week we will have <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> several </ERR> test.
This Monday we had had a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phisical </ERR> test.
So in the <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> four </ERR> day's holiday, I'll try my best to grasp the knowledge and keep up with other classmates.
In fact, my birthday <ERR type=[vp4,3-3]> had </ERR> past for several months.
For some reasons, my good <ERR type=[ad1,3-3]> friend </ERR> only can give me the present these days.
Because our friendship <ERR type=[vp4,1-2]> isn't </ERR> build by present, but it's very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ture </ERR> and pure.
Tomorrow -- <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Oxtober </ERR> 1 is our National day.
Everybody in <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> China </ERR> know this.
October 6 Friday Rainy It was raining hard when I went to school this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> morniong </ERR> .
I was <ERR type=[np6,3-1]> wearing </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> clothing </ERR> with <ERR type=[np6,3-3]> short </ERR> sleeve at that time.
<ERR type=[vp1,1-3]> I </ERR> felt it very cold.
When I got to the classroom, I found that many of my classmates were <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> wearing </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> clothing </ERR> with <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> long </ERR> sleeve.
thought:" Why didn't I <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> wear </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> clothing </ERR> with <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> long </ERR> sleeve?
After a while, the classmate who sat by my <ERR type=[vp6,6-4]> side </ERR> take off her outer clothing and said: "Would you like to put on my clothing?
" She began to <ERR type=[wd3,3-0]> find </ERR> .
A <ERR type=[fm1,-]> miunte </ERR> later, she found it out.
But I remembered that <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> I </ERR> haven't brought my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ticke </ERR> .
[fm3,-] she said:" Don't worry about this, you can go and find Mr Zhu if you won't go into the theater.
I must try to remember <ERR type=[fm1,-]> everything </ERR> .
The sports <ERR type=[vp3,3-3]> meet </ERR> were <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> had </ERR> this morning.
When the sports meet started, people were <ERR type=[wd3,-]> even </ERR> excited.
The first track and <ERR type=[np6,5-1]> field </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-0]> events </ERR> was run the 100-metre dash.
[fm3,-] the girl <ERR type=[vp7,2-2]> who </ERR> named Lin Minghua of our class won the champion.
Then the girls of our <ERR type=[wd4,6-5]> class </ERR> did well in the match: Our monitor named Xuan Yunsheng <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> won </ERR> third place in the 200-metre dash.
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Comparison </ERR> between the boys and the girls in our class, the boys wasn't so good as the girls.
I hope the <ERR type=[vp9,4-2]> boys </ERR> must <ERR type=[vp7,4-0]> not </ERR> discourage, but try to do better.
A <ERR type=[wd3,1-4]> match </ERR> which test our knowledge, our reaction, our strategy was <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> had </ERR> this Monday afternoon.
What kind was the <ERR type=[wd7,4-0]> match </ERR> ?
This was a <ERR type=[wd3,3-5]> match </ERR> about the knowledge on history.
It was the first activity <ERR type=[vp4,4-3]> that </ERR> be <ERR type=[wd3,2-5]> had </ERR> by the Communist Youth League.
[fm3,-] the question was not so difficult that each group can answer fundamentally.
The second part was the question <ERR type=[vp7,3-2]> that </ERR> anticipated to answer.
The girl in our group <ERR type=[vp7,6-2]> who </ERR> named Li Xiaojun depended on her own actual strength so that our <ERR type=[vp4,2-4]> grade </ERR> be in a higher place.
But a boy <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> who </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> group </ERR> three was very good at history.
A group must choose a question <ERR type=[wd3,-]> to </ERR> each group <ERR type=[np6,0-5]> among </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> grade 10, 20 or 30.
At last, our group won the champion in the <ERR type=[wd7,8-0]> match </ERR> .
[cj1,0-4] While I don't like it.
When I studied at junior <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> middle </ERR> school, I <ERR type=[wd2,2-3]> became </ERR> loathing rain very much.
So the students had to show their beautiful legs --rolled up their bottom of the trousers <ERR type=[wd5,1-0]> legs </ERR> , took off their shoes and <ERR type=[vp1,0-2]> socks, </ERR> waded the "river".
If they wouldn't be careful, they <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> would </ERR> plus a "printing" on their sole.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> watter </ERR> on the road was spattered on my treasured trousers.
It <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> always </ERR> make me unhappy.
It as to chorus a song <ERR type=[vp7,1-4]> which </ERR> named <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> brink <ERR type=[fm3,-]> of </ERR> love <ERR type=[fm3,-]> and </ERR> pain.
It was our turn, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> classmate and <ERR type=[vp6,7-3]> I </ERR> get on the stage.
At the same time, I saw my classmates who under the stage began to brandish <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> their </ERR> torch.
They all handed in <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> hand </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> and </ERR> lift <ERR type=[vp5,2-5]> them, </ERR> followed the rhythm and wave.
They can make us see <ERR type=[wd1,1-3]> the </ERR> all fine things in the world.
<ERR type=[pr1,1-5]> And </ERR> it'll live in a black world.
If you <ERR type=[wd2,3-0]> are </ERR> nearsightedness, then you'll <ERR type=[wd1,3-3]> be </ERR> not able to see the distinct things without glasses.
<ERR type=[vp1,1-3]> And </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> look </ERR> more <ERR type=[wd5.1-1]> the </ERR> plants.
I like singing, writing, taking a photo, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> drawing... </ERR> Because I <ERR type=[vp5,2-1]> think </ERR> take photos <ERR type=[vp5,3-2]> and </ERR> draw pictures can retain the beautiful scenery.
<ERR type=[vp5,1-3]> And </ERR> sing <ERR type=[wd4,2-2][vp5,2-1]> songs, </ERR> write can make things even better.
So in this art festival, I enter for <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> several </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,2-1]> item: </ERR> take <ERR type=[vp5,2-4]> photos, </ERR> sing a song, and calligraphy.
But <ERR type=[vp6,2-8]> I </ERR> take photos for the first time, I often worried about if I can do well in it.
In fact, I think everyone should be broadminded.If <ERR type=[fm1,-]> we </ERR> an do this, we'll be <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> happy </ERR> whatever time.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Beacuse </ERR> she made this wedding dress with 130 white rubbish sack.
And this was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stuitable </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Beacuse </ERR> her husband was a cleaning squad.
His fellows attended the wedding <ERR type=[fm1,-]> with </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> uniforrn </ERR> , too.
He said, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Only </ERR> a person <ERR type=[np3,-]> wear </ERR> formal attire, and that's me.
<ERR type=[vp7,1-4]> It </ERR> made use of scrap material <ERR type=[vp3,7-2]> and </ERR> protect the environment.
And the people who was stupid or unfit for his office would <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> not </ERR> able to see the cloth.
The Emperor was very pleased <ERR type=[wd3,-]> to </ERR> the message.
[fm1,-] he two cheats asked for the most beautiful silk and the best gold thread for themselves, and <ERR type=[vp4,1-2]> pretended </ERR> work hard at the empty looms.
After some tome, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> Emperor sent others to look at the cloth.But they could see nothing.
At last <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> Emperor himself went to see the cloth with a few of his officials.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> But </ERR> they all pretended they saw the beautiful cloth including <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> Emperor himself.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> Emperor </ERR> walk along the street with the new clothes.
In fact, he had nothing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oin </ERR> .
But nobody dared say the fact until a little child said: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> But </ERR> he has nothing on!
" The emperor heard <ERR type=[pr4,2-4]> he </ERR> cried and felt very silly.
This is the first <ERR type=[wd3,5-5]> Christmas </ERR> that I left my old friends.
Though we studied at <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> different </ERR> school, I <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> heard </ERR> from a few Christmas Card from them.
Of all the cards, I like best is the card which my best <ERR type=[vp6,3-4]> friend </ERR> send to me.
<ERR type=[vp7,1-7]> It </ERR> made <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> in </ERR> a piece of golden hard paper.
A piece of white cellophane paper <ERR type=[vp7,7-2][vp1,7-2]> is </ERR> covered with it.
On the white cellophane <ERR type=[vp3,0-3]> paper, </ERR> there's some special characters.
The whole card looks <ERR type=[cc4,5-0]> very </ERR> well.
But the reason <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> that </ERR> why I like the card isn't its surface, , it only because it <ERR type=[fm2,-]> was </ERR> send from my good friend!
She knew this, and wrote a lot <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> of </ERR> word.
She said she <ERR type=[wd4,2-7]> would </ERR> always at the same side with me.
I felt <ERR type=[wd4,3-4]> that </ERR> had a bosom friend is the luckiest thing.
<ERR type=[fm3,-][np7,-]> Sea </ERR> is beautiful and mysterious.
When <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> sunlight </ERR> shine on the limpid sea, <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp3,1-3]> seawater </ERR> reflex much gold light.
If you put two wood chairs with simple <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moulding </ERR> on the seaside, let <ERR type=[fm1,-]> seawateer </ERR> soak the legs of the chairs.
What a beautiful <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tablean </ERR> !
It <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> always </ERR> stretch out both warm arms, <ERR type=[vp3,8-4]> and </ERR> make people feel comfortable.
At night, the <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> sea </ERR> become mysterious.
<ERR type=[ad1,1-1]> You </ERR> only can hear the sound that from the wave lash the rock.
I think the sea in the evening is enjoyed <ERR type=[wd3,-]> with </ERR> ears.
The officials had to be at his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beck </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp6,-]> call </ERR> .
Then they <ERR type=[wd4,-]> walked </ERR> had nothing on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> Emperor looked at those men <ERR type=[fm3,-]> -- </ERR> They were so unsightly.
So another man became <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> Emperor.
Then what about the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> old </ERR> Emperor?

Wang Faye is not good <ERR type=[vp5,2-2]> at </ERR> link up stranger all along.
And <ERR type=[vp3,1-4]> she </ERR> don't like to tell others about her private matter.

My father was helping me <ERR type=[wd3,6-1]> and </ERR> pointed me where I have done wrong.
<ERR type=[vp5,1-3]> After </ERR> changed the steel wires, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> bearing has oiled and the bike has cleaned.
It took me three hours <ERR type=[vp5,5-2]> to </ERR> repaired my bike.

From the game, each of <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> the </ERR> player learns to go all out for his term and not for himself.
Music can mould our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dispostion </ERR> .
How joyful and relaxing it is <ERR type=[vp2,3-3]> to </ERR> listen some good music.
Not only the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> music can make me revel in, but also the foreign music.
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, Yesterday once more, By the rivers of Babylon <ERR type=[wd4,5-2]> and </ERR> so on.

Professor Hunter was very excited that morning <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beacause </ERR> he had just finished the papers of his invention.
He wanted his <ERR type=[vp5,4-1]> invention </ERR> belong to the world and everyone would be able to benefit from it.
But he was not strong enough to go to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> london </ERR> and give the papers to the government himself, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> trip would be too much for him.
So two men of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goverment </ERR> would come to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prefessor's </ERR> home and take the papers to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> london </ERR> .
Mary Hunter, the professor's daughter, was <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> catch </ERR> a <ERR type=[wd3,-]> call </ERR> and went to the hospital <ERR type=[vp5,4-2]> to </ERR> saw her friend that morning.

They showed their cards to Miss <ERR type=[wd4,0-2]> Green, </ERR> professor's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> secetary </ERR> .
[np7,0-2] The Professor Hunter gave them some papers and they left in a hurry.
After a while, two inspectors came to the professor's home and told the professor that the men <ERR type=[vp6,7-2]> who </ERR> have just taken the papers away <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> were </ERR> impostor.
But the professor was not <ERR type=[wd2,-]> hurry </ERR> , because when he met <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> the </ERR> impostor, he didn't trust them.
They seemed to be too nervous and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> were </ERR> to anxious <ERR type=[fm1,-]> to </ERR> let.
Professor Hunter told the inspector <ERR type=[wd4,0-4]> that </ERR> two impostors' look like, then he decided to take the papers to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> london </ERR> himself.
When I was a primary school pupil, I lived <ERR type=[np7,3-2]> in </ERR> the common house.
The balcony was not big, but it had <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> just </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,1-2]> to </ERR> planted some plants, such as orchid, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chilli </ERR> and so on.
In summer, their leaves sway in the wind <ERR type=[vp5,1-2]> like </ERR> beckon to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sb </ERR> .If <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> you </ERR> planted some practical <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> plants </ERR> , you will have a little harvest in autumn.

<ERR type=[fm3,-][pr1,-]> uncle's </ERR> wedding ceremony was held <ERR type=[wd3,-]> on </ERR> the Dong Fang Hotel.
I wish that my uncle and aunt were <ERR type=[pp1,9-2]> living </ERR> for white <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> hair </ERR> for ever
In the new year, I wished everything would be better, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> everyone </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> would </ERR> happy.
Although the Spring Festival <ERR type=[cc4,4-2]> was </ERR> cold and rainy from time to <ERR type=[cj1,12-4]> time, </ERR> but the people didn't mind.
The businessman was selling the sweets <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> for </ERR> the year to the people.
Perhaps they got a new toy <ERR type=[np6,0-2]> or </ERR> <ERR type=[np3-2]> a </ERR> new clothes.
A lot of sports <ERR type=[np6,5-2]> and </ERR> game were canceled.
I have <ERR type=[vp5,3-2]> to </ERR> stayed at home.
But I wasn't free, <ERR type=[wd4,1-4]> I </ERR> made up the missed lessons <ERR type=[np5,3-0]> and </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> snowledges </ERR> that I lost <ERR type=[wd5,-]> in </ERR> last term and finished the homework <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> for </ERR> holiday.
We only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> regreted </ERR> that we could not play the smoke-flower and firecrackers.
The <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> winter </ERR> holiday was short, but I felt happy <ERR type=[wd5,3-0]> yet </ERR> .
The day which I stayed at grandparents' home with my cousin is the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happest </ERR> day.
But it <ERR type=[np7,2-2]> was </ERR> a " unfortunate" day for me too.
When <ERR type=[vp6,5-3]> I </ERR> go back <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> to </ERR> home, I had a stomachache.
I couldn't <ERR type=[np5,3-2]> have </ERR> a greasy food in two days.
I would remember this thing <ERR type=[vp9,0-4]> and </ERR> dare not <ERR type=[fm2,-]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,4-1]> over </ERR> eating again.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Before </ERR> Several <ERR type=[np7,2-1]> years </ERR> the people didn't like <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> buying </ERR> book in the Spring Festival.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Beacuse </ERR> the <ERR type=[np4,2-1]> " </ERR> book"'s pronunciation was the same as the "lose".
But this year was <ERR type=[fm3,-][np7,0-4]> different, </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> peope </ERR> like <ERR type=[np6,4-4]> buying </ERR> book in the Spring Festival.
In the buying book <ERR type=[cc4,3-]> centre </ERR> of Tian He, a lot of <ERR type=[vp6,12-2]> people </ERR> was <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> buying </ERR> book.
It <ERR type=[wd3,2-4][np7,2-1]> announced </ERR> the knowledge was important <ERR type=[np7,2-2]> in </ERR> the people's <ERR type=[wd3,2-0]> heart </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,0-2]> and </ERR> the people's idea was changed.
He is the designer of socialism reformation and <ERR type=[wd2,3-1]> modernize </ERR> building.
It <ERR type=[fm2,-]> is </ERR> DenXiaoPing <ERR type=[vp3,2-8]> that </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> make </ERR> the people live a warm and full <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> living </ERR> .
Hong Kong and Macao <ERR type=[vp9,s]> can </ERR> come back to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> china </ERR> because of his theory of <ERR type=[np6,1-3]> "Two </ERR> system in one country".
With his trying, the relation <ERR type=[fm3,-]> between </ERR> china <ERR type=[np7,5-2]> and </ERR> the other countries were improved.
Chinese economy's developing was looked with new eyes by the <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> developed </ERR> country and the <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> developing </ERR> country.
So the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> people were very sad when we heard the news of Den's death.
A student as we are, we will study hard in order that we can make our country become a rich, <ERR type=[wd7,4-1]> strong, </ERR> culture country at an early date.
[fm2,-] DenXiaoPing will immortalize!
Some <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> changes </ERR> had taken place in the blackboard of our classroom.
The <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> blackboard </ERR> was not black <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> and </ERR> turn white.
<ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> Teachers </ERR> didn't need to write on the blackboard in chalk.
The chalk's <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> powder </ERR> didn't fly everywhere.
[cj1,0-10] Although it has some <ERR type=[wd3,3-5]> little </ERR> problems in the class sometimes, but I think it unimportant.
[fm3,-] we <ERR type=[vp1,2-1]> will </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comefort </ERR> and like it before long.
Hong Kong will come back to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> china </ERR> after one hundred days.
A lot of places in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> china </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,6-1]> were </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> congratulating </ERR> .

We have written the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compositons </ERR> of environmental protection this month.

During the course of <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> writing </ERR> composition I have read a lot of materials.
Our environment was no good than before and the natural <ERR type=[vp3,3-4]> resources </ERR> was reduced day by day.
[np7,0-7] The people didn't pay attention to environment protection.
I often see that some rubbish such as peel plastic bag were <ERR type=[fm2,-]> thew </ERR> away by some people on the street.
As we know, a beautiful environment was <ERR type=[vp7,5-2]> closely </ERR> linked our living.
It's important for us to protect the environment Don't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> destory </ERR> the environment again!
<ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> He </ERR> couldn't <ERR type=[vp4,1-]> imagined </ERR> the situation of computer <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> in </ERR> today.

So they wanted to <ERR type=[wd3,14-3]> preview </ERR> once for us.
All of us support our <ERR type=[np6,5-1]> player </ERR> <ERR type=[ad1,8-0]> surely </ERR> .
Though my mother <ERR type=[wd3,3-6]> commanded </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,6-5]> me </ERR> come back to home early, I stayed with our classmates.
When I passed <ERR type=[wd5,3-6]> by </ERR> the gate of the Children's Palace, I saw a child with a little basket.
There <ERR type=[vp3,1-7]> was </ERR> a black and yellow duck in it.
How <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> lovable </ERR> the duck was!
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> floweres </ERR> of Spring The Spring Festival will come, so my father and brother <ERR type=[wd3,10-2]> brought </ERR> some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> floweres </ERR> .
There were many kinds of <ERR type=[np6,5-16]> colour </ERR> , red, yellow, pink and purplish red, <ERR type=[wd3,14-9]> added </ERR> to the narcissus, the colour was white and green .
These <ERR type=[fm1,-]> floweres </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,2-6]> let </ERR> my home became a lovely garden.
Feb 5th <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Wensday </ERR> Rainy
Today is a very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inportant </ERR> day for my hometown.
Because the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> leaderes </ERR> of Guangdong <ERR type=[wd3,5-4]> Sheng </ERR> come to our village.
There were many kinds of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> floweres </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,6-2]> beside </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> street, </ERR> the colour flags were seen everywhere.
And I could see my beautiful hometown <ERR type=[pp1,7-2]> in </ERR> the TV.
The family's <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> people </ERR> will get together.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Aunts </ERR> and cousins.
We went to a <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> restaurant </ERR> have lunch.
While we <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> had </ERR> a good lunch, we sang <ERR type=[wd3,10-0]> highly </ERR> .Then we enjoyed our time.
It's very funny, not only I <ERR type=[vp6,6-1]> think </ERR> so.
Every day was <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> arranged </ERR> full of works, so I felt <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> replenish </ERR> and busy.
Sometimes I <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> watch </ERR> TV and listen the radio.
The toy <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> liked </ERR> a plate.
In the each <ERR type=[wd4,3-9]> of </ERR> four directions, there was a lovely and little "animal".
The animals' <ERR type=[fm2,-]> mouthes </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> will </ERR> "eat" the balls.
So one or four people <ERR type=[vp6,5-7]> can </ERR> play the game at the same time.
And <ERR type=[vp6,1-7]> see </ERR> who could "eat" more balls than other.
I saw the interesting toy yesterday, It <ERR type=[vp6,1-6]> can </ERR> let us <ERR type=[vp5,6-3]> though </ERR> of our childhoods.
She <ERR type=[fm2,-]> like </ERR> <ERR type=[vp2,4-5]> listening </ERR> the music and reading books.
So she goes to perform, <ERR type=[wd6][wd6,-]> many </ERR> places .
She always <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> want </ERR> to become a musician.
The verses of this song is <ERR type=[wd3,6-4]> pertinent </ERR> our feeling very much.
How <ERR type=[ad2,1-0]> happily </ERR> I could hear the song today .
She said she just <ERR type=[vp6,4-8]> went </ERR> to the Beijing Road and bought some books.
She <ERR type=[fm2,-]> studys </ERR> very hard, always.
When I was going to the bus-stop on foot, I saw the bus <ERR type=[vp5,13-3]> ran </ERR> across the road.
And I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> brough </ERR> a box of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> everage </ERR> .
And I ran to the bus quickly, <ERR type=[vp1,7-5]> asked </ERR> the driver open the door.
I <ERR type=[wd4,7-1]> remembered </ERR> one day, Miss Lin talked to us seriously.
I must <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> treat </ERR> the fact.
But I was afraid to ask for advice from her and I was afraid to <ERR type=[wd3,15-2]> stare </ERR> her eyes.
I wish Miss Lin can <ERR type=[vp2,5-5]> point </ERR> y <ERR type=[np6,9-3]> mistake </ERR> , or scold me, then I can <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> remember </ERR> for ever.
I need <ERR type=[wd4,2-6]> plenty </ERR> time to have a good rest.
In the spare time, I read the <ERR type=[wd4,7-4]> newspaper </ERR> listen to the radio.
But she is <ERR type=[aj2,3-2]> busy </ERR> her homework So I can't find a partner now.
<ERR type=[np6,0-4]> Sport </ERR> do good to us.
I think that the red clothes are their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> term </ERR> -clothes.
Because it can <ERR type=[vp2,3-6]> take </ERR> our play ground a new look.
I hope our school <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> become </ERR> more beautiful.
So I couldn't buy any <ERR type=[fm1,-]> floweres </ERR> this morning.
When I turned on the radio, then I <ERR type=[vp6,8-3]> remember </ERR> the important day.
I put them into a white vase and <ERR type=[wd3,8-4]> took </ERR> it on the desk.
Instead, she <ERR type=[vp1,1-8]> asked </ERR> me do my homework and have a rest.
Students can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> so </ERR> some sporting in the playground.

<ERR type=[ad2,0-7]> Sure </ERR> enough the girl <ERR type=[vp6,6-3]> is </ERR> my old classmate.

<ERR type=[fm3,-]> she </ERR> said she had a bad cold last week, after taking some medicine, she was getting better now.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> she heard that everything was all right, I could see she was pleased.
Finally we asked our teacher not to worry <ERR type=[wd4,-]> about </ERR> work and have a good rest.
This morning, my good friend went to visit me and told me a story about <ERR type=[pr1,13-0]> her </ERR> : A few days ago, when she was hurrying to school, her bike broke own.
But she had no money, she was <ERR type=[vp2,2-3]> worried </ERR> what to do.
Just then a student whom she did not <ERR type=[vp6,8-2]> new </ERR> passed by.
Yesterday, she has <ERR type=[vp6,3-8]> known </ERR> hat he boy was the cadre of school.
I thought that he is a <ERR type=[ad2,6-2]> really </ERR> good student.
October 12 Saturday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> sunny </ERR>
It is eight o'clock, we are holding the sports meeting <ERR type=[wd4,6-5]> of </ERR> school in the workers' stadium.
This is a high jump match, some students are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pracitising </ERR> .
When the match <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp6,3-0]> benginning </ERR> she runs very fast, at last, she <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> has </ERR> won this match.
She is a very good <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> running </ERR> player.
Sunday October 20 <ERR type=[fm3,-]> sunny </ERR>
So I decided to go to <ERR type=[np7,-]> street </ERR> .
Please <ERR type=[cc3,0-2]> do </ERR> more teaching.
<ERR type=[vp6,0-4]> That's </ERR> a very bad morning.
I found there <ERR type=[vp6,3-11]> is </ERR> something wrong with my bike, but there is little time left and the Repairing Bike's <ERR type=[np1,3-0]> shop </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,6-1]> didn't </ERR> open until eight o'clock.
I <ERR type=[vp1,1-4]> force </ERR> to run to school.
I forgot to bring the <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> chemist's </ERR> exercise after all.
I didn't <ERR type=[vp1,2-4]> know </ERR> to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> laught </ERR> or cry.
I write the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compostion </ERR> the first time I'm very sorry that my English is limited.
Please <ERR type=[cc3,0-2]> do </ERR> more teaching.
One was the <ERR type=[np4,0-1]> physics's </ERR> test, the other was English test.
In fact I didn't do my best to go over the <ERR type=[cc3,3-0]> tests </ERR> .
We will have four <ERR type=[wd7,4-2]> holidays </ERR> this week.
But we still <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> had </ERR> lots of homework to do.
When we <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> come </ERR> back to school, we will have the <ERR type=[np3,1-5]> test </ERR> of geography, <ERR type=[fm1-]> chemirstry </ERR> and Chinese.
Because I don't think that my <ERR type=[cc2,5-2]> test </ERR> don't ass, <ERR type=[wd3,10-0]> too </ERR> .
<ERR type=[np7,0-1]> The </ERR> maths is more difficult than before.
Then we <ERR type=[vp6,1-2]> have </ERR> two tests.
I <ERR type=[wd3,1-10]> think </ERR> that I must not make many mistakes in these tests.If I was more <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> carefully </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[vp6,6-8]> will </ERR> <ERR type=[vp2,2-5]> be </ERR> more <ERR type=[ad3,1-]> better </ERR> in these tests.
It was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aften </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,s]> raining </ERR> last week.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-5]> was </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Suddenly </ERR> getting cold on Friday.
The <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Weather </ERR> often changes.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-][np4,1-1]> mathe's </ERR> exercises <ERR type=[vp3,5-2]> is </ERR> very hard.
Because there will be a <ERR type=[np4,4-1]> maths' </ERR> test next week.
On <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> the </ERR> Friday, the class had been over.
I still <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> do </ERR> the exercises with some classmates.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-5]> So </ERR> I <ERR type=[vp6,4-5]> go </ERR> home, it was very late.
My mother and father <ERR type=[vp3,4-3]> was </ERR> worried about me.
Oct.15 Sunday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> raining </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> We </ERR> went to <ERR type=[np7,3-3]> school </ERR> to do work.
We <ERR type=[wd3,1-5]> forced </ERR> to <ERR type=[vp1,5-5][fm1,-]> strop </ERR> to do work.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> We </ERR> went to the Bei Lei Cinema and see <ERR type=[np7,-1]> the </ERR> film.
It was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> intrutive </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,5-1]> for </ERR> us.
We must choose good persons as <ERR type=[wd5,6-1]> own </ERR> friends.
We are <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> standing </ERR> he <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> crossing </ERR> .
We must choose the right way to <ERR type=[wd3,5-0]> walk </ERR> .
Our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> homelend </ERR> has taken place for several years.
We are working hard for our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> homelend </ERR> .
We don't waste time spending <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unuseful </ERR> things.
We <ERR type=[wd4,1-5]> use </ERR> time <ERR type=[pp1,-]> in </ERR> how to learn, Chinese, English, physics, maths, chemistry and geography... We are <ERR type=[vp6,2-7][fm2,-]> Founding </ERR> right object to <ERR type=[vp2,3-1]> work </ERR> hard.
We will be more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> intrutive </ERR> .
4 Middle School went to the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> Working </ERR> Stadium, We had a sports.
The <ERR type=[np3,-]> sports </ERR> was very wonderful.
I joined one of <ERR type=[pr1,-]> the </ERR> who is four <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hunderd </ERR> running.
I heard <ERR type=[wd5,2-6]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,5-2]> anybody </ERR> said that It's too hard.
At last, I kept on running four hundred metres, <ERR type=[cj1,0-11]> but </ERR> I was <ERR type=[wd5,2-2]> only </ERR> the seventh, but I was glad, too.
For I might <ERR type=[vp8,3-3]> kept </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> in </ERR> doing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sth </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[wd2,-s]> sure </ERR> that I can run <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> the </ERR> better next time.
I wasn't <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> discourage </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[wd5,1-5]> was </ERR> also <ERR type=[vp1,5-3]> thank </ERR> for my classmates, they encouraged me and took good care of me.
Though I anted to go to school, I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> knowed </ERR> I <ERR type=[wd3,5-0]> didn't </ERR> .
The doctor asked me to stay hospital <ERR type=[vp5,7-0]> observing </ERR> .
The next morning, I felt <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> better, </ERR> my parents didn't <ERR type=[ad1,5-0]> also </ERR> worry about me, They were <ERR type=[aj2,2-2]> busy </ERR> for me, they had very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tried </ERR> for, they had looked after me all day.
On Friday <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> day </ERR> morning, I <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> keep </ERR> up going to school, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Buy </ERR> that day, <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> morning </ERR> , it was raining, so I <ERR type=[wd3,1-6]> went </ERR> to school that was very late, the classmate <ERR type=[vp1,2-8]> asked </ERR> me that I didn't be at school's reason.
Oct 5 Sunday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> raining </ERR>
I was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tried </ERR> .
I must get up even earlier to go on to go over the tests than <ERR type=[wd2,8-0]> usually </ERR> .
But <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It's </ERR> leaving little time exactly I studied the homework.
We will have <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> examination </ERR> next day.
It's <ERR type=[np7,1-4]> a </ERR> very important for us.
though I'm afraid that I don't <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> examination </ERR> well, I will try my best to do the best.
I think when we have questions and don't understand the meaning of the text, we <ERR type=[vp8,1-4]> must </ERR> be asking the teacher, If we can do this, we will <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> grasp </ERR> much better.
This is one of the <ERR type=[np4,5-1]> studying's </ERR> ways.
The <ERR type=[cc1,-3]> middle </ERR> of the examination was over.
From Monday to Friday, among this five days, we were <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> going </ERR> to the <ERR type=[np1,7-5][fm1,-]> bace </ERR> of the farm.
<ERR type=[pr3,0-2]> This </ERR> five days were very instructive <ERR type=[pp1,3-1]> for </ERR> me.
In these days, I <ERR type=[vp6,4-5]> look </ERR> on myself as a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> famer </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Though </ERR> five <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> days' </ERR> work, I know everything was not <ERR type=[wd2,3-1]> easy </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> invented </ERR> .
We must <ERR type=[vp8,2-3]> took </ERR> good care of our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happly </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,12-0]> living </ERR> .
We <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> must </ERR> clear that we came here was not spending our holiday, We came here in order to learn how to work like a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> famer </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pp2,0-1]> Except </ERR> working, we also had <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> class </ERR> .
The teacher showed us around all kinds of the <ERR type=[vp2,9-0]> plants </ERR> .I <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> studied </ERR> much knowledge.
For example, the football match and the basketball match.These <ERR type=[fm2,-]> matched </ERR> were very wonderful.
The most of the <ERR type=[wd7,4-5]> forgetting </ERR> was the five <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> days' </ERR> work.
This work as not only dirty but also <ERR type=[aj4,8-0]> tried </ERR> .
<ERR type=[np8,0-1]> Many </ERR> work has never been done before these days.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> everything </ERR> was done by myself.
But all these for me <ERR type=[vp3,4-2]> is </ERR> really instructive.
I will <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp1,2-2]> remeber </ERR> for ever.
All of <ERR type=[pr1,2-3]> this </ERR> are like before.
On <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> the </ERR> Friday afternoon, we were <ERR type=[wd5,2-7]> been </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,5-8]> on </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,0-5]> choosing </ERR> the leader of our class.
At <ERR type=[np2,1-0]> class </ERR> , eleven classmates were <ERR type=[fm2,-]> choosed </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> many </ERR> new classmates took part in this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> choosion </ERR> .
On <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> the </ERR> Friday evening.
Our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perants </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-9]> come </ERR> to our school <ERR type=[vp4,8-5]> took </ERR> part in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perants' </ERR> meeting.
Let them know our the <ERR type=[cc1,-3]> middle </ERR> of the <ERR type=[fm1,-][np4,1-1]> examintion's </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> recults </ERR> .
I am usually in this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> examintion </ERR> , I will work hard at studying.
I made many mistakes in this <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> text </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> examintion </ERR> , I found my <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> shortcoming </ERR> .
On Friday morning, I <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> forget </ERR> to bring <ERR type=[np1,0-3]> mathers' </ERR> book and the English of <ERR type=[np1,3-1]> listening's </ERR> book.
<ERR type=[pr1,0-5]> It </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> forced </ERR> me to go home, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Because </ERR> on this <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> day </ERR> afternoon, the last class was the <ERR type=[np1,1-2]> English </ERR> of listening, that book was very important.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> I must <ERR type=[wd3,8-6]> take </ERR> it back to do the exercises.
On <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Saterday </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moring </ERR> , we are going to <ERR type=[np7,2-0]> cinema </ERR> to see <ERR type=[np7,9-3]> the </ERR> film, about revolutionary.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frighting </ERR> .
between <ERR type=[np7,1-3]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,4-2]> China </ERR> and Japanese.
But our Chinese army wasn't <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> discourage </ERR> , they kept on <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frighting </ERR> ,at last, they won.
They was in order to <ERR type=[vp5,5-7]> saved </ERR> the Chinese people,and losed their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lifes </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pr3,0-2]> This </ERR> two holidays, I was very busy.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Becase </ERR> there will be many tests next week.
In <ERR type=[pr3,1-2]> this </ERR> two days, I <ERR type=[vp8,1-12]> must </ERR> catch time to <ERR type=[vp1,3-1]> go </ERR> over, But I didn't do so.
On Saturday, I <ERR type=[vp6,1-11]> was </ERR> only watching TV, and have a rest, So the last <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> day </ERR> , I was very busy, I must try to go over <ERR type=[fm1,-]> there </ERR> subjects and homework.
Dec Saturday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> raining </ERR>
Long <ERR type=[wd6,-]> long </ERR> ago there were an Emperor and his foolish ministers.
He really <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> care </ERR> more for his new clothes.
He tried them <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> on </ERR> a long time every <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> day </ERR> morning.
They said that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thay </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,3-3]> was </ERR> able to weave clothes of the <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> more </ERR> beautiful colors and <ERR type=[cc3,11-3]> designs </ERR> in the world, they also said that the clothes would be invisible to anyone <ERR type=[wd4,3-5]> who </ERR> either stupid or unfit for his office .
The cheats <ERR type=[vp1,2-9]> took </ERR> some gold and silk from the Emperor to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> theirselves </ERR> .
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> face </ERR> , they worked at the empty looms.
Then the emperor and his ministers went to see <ERR type=[wd5,-]> the </ERR> the cloth, though they <ERR type=[vp6,1-]> lay </ERR> nothing, they were in order not to let anyone else know this.
They also said that they <ERR type=[vp8,5-4]> would </ERR> see the beautiful colors.
The Emperor was even <ERR type=[wd2,s-][aj3,4-5]> fooler </ERR> to walk in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> porcession </ERR> with nothing on.
At last only a child <ERR type=[vp2,0-3]> spoke </ERR> out the truth.
This is the story that <ERR type=[vp7,5-1]> talk </ERR> about.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Chistmas </ERR> tomorrow.
But Christmas is not <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> be </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,6-2]> noticed </ERR> in <ERR type=[wd2,10-0]> Chinese </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> we don't have holidays.
The North Chonutries' <ERR type=[np1,5-0]> people </ERR> are very happy in Christmas and the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Children </ERR> will <ERR type=[wd3,5-6]> take </ERR> presents from their mother and father, sooner and later, Christmas from the North <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Chonutries </ERR> to China.
But I hope everyone who <ERR type=[vp3,2-5]> have </ERR> a good time in Christmas who have a good time in Christmas and said "Merry Christmas!
Middle <ERR type=[np4,3-1]> School's </ERR> students went to Beilei cinema.
It will be <ERR type=[np7,0-2]> New </ERR> Year's Day tomorrow.
All the people are very pleased, the old year was <ERR type=[vp7,4-0]> passed </ERR> , All the streets and shops and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> parts </ERR> that there were many people.
I couldn't help <ERR type=[vp1,3-9]> thinking </ERR> a lot of things and <ERR type=[np8,0-1]> much </ERR> hope .hope that in the new year, I will make rapid <ERR type=[np5,2-0]> progresses </ERR> and my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> falimies </ERR> are happy.
Mr. Zhu wanted to let us <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> master </ERR> the lesson's words.
But the <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> test's </ERR> result <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> wasn't </ERR> make anyone <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> satisfily </ERR> .I made many mistakes in this test So I was in <ERR type=[np7,11-0]> class </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[wd5,1-19]> didn't </ERR> think that I have studied in school for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> evrel </ERR> years, but I couldn't write so many words.
this really <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> let </ERR> anybody laugh.
I asked myself, if I could put my heart into listening and when I went over the texts, I was more <ERR type=[wd2,3-0]> carefully </ERR> .
This <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> thing </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> wasn't </ERR> happening.
We also had <ERR type=[np4,0-3]> mathes' </ERR> and physics' test.
Many subjects already <ERR type=[vp7,3-0]> finished </ERR> , the teachers began to <ERR type=[vp1,4-3]> go </ERR> over for us .
We'll have <ERR type=[np6,2-3]> examination </ERR> in this term in a mouth.
I think the physics and mathes <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> is </ERR> more <ERR type=[pr1,8-2]> It's </ERR> not <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffiult </ERR> , It's not easy to study them well.
Perhaps I took <ERR type=[wd3,-]> much </ERR> time to do exercises about them.
So I was <ERR type=[wd3,2-4]> bad </ERR> in this Chinese test.
But I don't <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> discovery </ERR> .
I'll do my best to think <ERR type=[vp2,6-6]> over </ERR> the good <ERR type=[np1,2-1]> studying </ERR> ways.
The <ERR type=[wd7,1-3]> coming </ERR> procession was <ERR type=[wd2,6-0]> end </ERR> , the Emperor got back and he was very angry.
You <ERR type=[vp1,1-7]> try </ERR> on <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sevrel </ERR> times in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fron </ERR> of me, and you <ERR type=[vp8,1-7]> must </ERR> care about your kingdom and your people.
" To his surprise, the mirror <ERR type=[fm1,-]> isappeared </ERR> .
He <ERR type=[vp6,1-6]> care </ERR> about his kingdom and his people.
And the <ERR type=[wd7,1-9]> kingdom </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd5,5-7]> of </ERR> the people <ERR type=[vp3,10-4]> was </ERR> very kind to him.
Mar Sunday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> raining </ERR>
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> winder </ERR> holiday passed fast.
In those days, It was <ERR type=[wd3,2-8]> very </ERR> cold that many people <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> rather </ERR> stayed at home, who didn't go to street to do some shopping.
[wd4,0-9] The spring festival my family <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,5-3]> have </ERR> visited the friends, I got much lucky <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moneny </ERR> that let me be happy in these cold days.
The new term <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> have </ERR> begun.
But one thing <ERR type=[wd3,2-12]> which </ERR> made me <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> be </ERR> unhappy was changing the seat.
I am NOT <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm1,-]> satified </ERR> with my seat.
I hope that Mr Zhu will be able to change my seat again after one or <ERR type=[wd7,-]> two </ERR> .
Because he said he <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> will </ERR> change the seat every <ERR type=[wd7,8-0]> three </ERR> .
In this way trees clean the air so <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> we breathe.
With their roots and leaves, trees <ERR type=[wd3,1-10]> stop </ERR> strong wind and swift rain water from taking away <ERR type=[np7,1-]> soil </ERR> .
Many people grow flowers in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couryard </ERR> or in their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gardons </ERR> while they were planted in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> blosssom </ERR> , some people put them indoors as decoration Flowers <ERR type=[vp4,8-8]> add </ERR> beauty to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envirionment </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> urily </ERR> the air.
[cc2,-] and the plants will soon die.
Some <ERR type=[fm2,-]> growers </ERR> cut away <ERR type=[fm1,-]> delibertely </ERR> certain branches so as to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ape </ERR> the plant beautiful.
Farmers are <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> having </ERR> bumper harvest.
They are cutting rice, <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> In </ERR> the left, cows are eating grass.
During <ERR type=[np7,-]> vacation </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp6,17-4]> see </ERR> the picture in reality.
Suddenly he saw <ERR type=[np7,3-5]> the </ERR> mark of a man's foot.
He <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> stare </ERR> at <ERR type=[pr1,5-1]> their </ERR> footprint that put fear into the heart of him.
Crusoe said to himself, it <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> can't </ERR> be lived someone else in this lonely <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ailand </ERR> ,but who had made...
he hurried home and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> staied </ERR> in his cave ever since then.
Little by little, he had nothing to eat and for <ERR type=[pr3,0-1]> this </ERR> days, no savages <ERR type=[wd4,3-5]> came </ERR> he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> desided </ERR> to go out again.
But he felt very lonely,he had no friends except an old dog that only made him feel <ERR type=[cc5,1-0]> fortunately </ERR> .
He often worried about the footmark and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> desided </ERR> to go back to <ERR type=[vp1,12-1]> go </ERR> through.
He looked at the footprint, realizing there must be somebody <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ailand </ERR> , then he returned home <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> with </ERR> full of fear.
[wd4,0-12] looked for a better <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hiding-flace </ERR> in order to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> defence </ERR> his enemy.He stepped into the cave, it was darker and darker, Suddenly he saw two eyes glaring at him, he left at once.
He didn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> safe <ERR type=[fm1,-]> encough </ERR> , he was <ERR type=[wd7,-3]> ready </ERR> for a stick, a <ERR type=[wd4,-]> lot </ERR> gun-powder.
To his <ERR type=[fm2,-]> surprised </ERR> , he found a dead goat whose eyes that had <ERR type=[vp7,9-0]> seen </ERR> .
There were nine savages on the shore, he found they seemed to be eating and cooking <ERR type=[pp1,9-2]> in </ERR> the fire.
He walked to the shore until the canoes which the <ERR type=[wd2,1-0]> savages </ERR> were in, was out of sight,, he found the bones of a human being that <ERR type=[vp3,9-3]> was </ERR> beside the fire.
He came to know they <ERR type=[vp6,5-6]> will </ERR> do harm to him one day.
So he <ERR type=[vp2,1-5]> made </ERR> his mind to tell them if they came here again.
She was about <ERR type=[wd3,-]> forties </ERR> and taught us maths.
She was very kind <ERR type=[pp1,4-1]> for </ERR> us, so all the students <ERR type=[vp1,4-2]> like </ERR> very much.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Ne </ERR> day, when she was <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> having </ERR> a lesson, all the students paid attention to the lesson <ERR type=[fm1,-]> expct </ERR> one boy.
But Miss Li didn't <ERR type=[wd2,3-0]> angrily </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd3,6-4]> so </ERR> let him sit down.
Miss Li said with a mile: Don't make the same <ERR type=[cc3,3-0]> wrong </ERR> again.
After that the boy never <ERR type=[np3,2-]> sleep </ERR> in the class.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> sunny </ERR> August 5.
My friends and I <ERR type=[vp2,0-2]> went </ERR> to shopping, also had many people.
After a while one young man <ERR type=[vp6,6-0]> cry </ERR> : "my pocket didn't <ERR type=[cc2,-]> see </ERR> ", The conductor asked: "Did you remember where it <ERR type=[vp7,5-0]> put </ERR> , How <ERR type=[np8,1-1]> many </ERR> monkey on it.
" <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Beacause </ERR> nobody knew who was the thief, <ERR type=[cj1,7-8]> so </ERR> the driver said he would drive the bus to <ERR type=[np7,4-3]> office </ERR> of the police and didn't let.
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> As </ERR> the red light, the bus stopped.
Suddenly one tall man <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> got </ERR> off from the window.
Him and cried out <ERR type=[vp6,0-2]> "caught </ERR> the thief.
" All the people were pleased because the police <ERR type=[fm1,-]> caugh </ERR> the thief red-handed.
<ERR type=[vp6,0-3]> It's </ERR> a horrible day!
Today my aunt and <ERR type=[pr4,3-0]> me </ERR> took the No 237 bus to Tian He, the <ERR type=[np1,1-2]> middle </ERR> of bookshop.
It had a lot of <ERR type=[np3,3-0]> book </ERR> and four <ERR type=[np3,1-0]> floor </ERR> .
[wd4,0-8] The first floor there <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> were </ERR> famous works of <ERR type=[fm1,-][np1,3-0]> word </ERR> .
[wd4,0-7] The second floor <ERR type=[np7,-]> and </ERR> third floor were <ERR type=[fm2,-]> study-book </ERR> .
It was summer holiday many <ERR type=[np3,1-0]> pupil </ERR> and students came <ERR type=[pp1,1-1]> to </ERR> here.
to buy some useful books, <ERR type=[cj2,16-5]> so </ERR> that the <ERR type=[wd4,3-0]> bookshop </ERR> very noisy.
We bought many books and saw some famous pictures of <ERR type=[np1,3-0]> word </ERR> .They were perfect.
<ERR type=[cj2,5-6]> so </ERR> that I didn't want <ERR type=[wd4,4-0]> to </ERR> away.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> rainy </ERR> August 14th Wednesday
It was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rainning </ERR> hard.
The little boy ran to help her and took her to the other side of the road with the woman, Then when the granny felt well to thank them, the little <ERR type=[np4,2-3]> boys </ERR> face turned red.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> rainy </ERR> September 22 Sunday
It was raining hard, but I must to <ERR type=[vp8,3-2]> go </ERR> <ERR type=[vp2,3-1]> out </ERR> shopping because we haven't any vegetables.
As soon as I shut my front door, I found that I <ERR type=[wd4,1-5]> had </ERR> my key in the house.
<ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> Nobody </ERR> in the house <ERR type=[cj2,6-9]> so </ERR> that I <ERR type=[vp1,1-6]> climb </ERR> up the window to take it.
The window didn't <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> close </ERR> .
I closed the door and went downstairs, then I found hat I had <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> gotten </ERR> to take umbrella.
I must get back again <ERR type=[cj2,5-5]> so </ERR> that I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> asted </ERR> much time.
Sunday Nov <ERR type=[fm1,-]> MoL </ERR>
I borrowed a novel named Jane Eyre from Miss Lin, which <ERR type=[fm2,-][vp7,1-3]> writed </ERR> in simple English.
I spent several hours <ERR type=[vp2,4-3]> to </ERR> read it today.
To my joy, the heroine <ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> master </ERR> found her own love, love and lover became couple.
The plot <ERR type=[wd4,4-0]> probably </ERR> very simple.
Though I finished reading, <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> tender </ERR> not enough.
So I decided to read the complete translation in this summer <ERR type=[fm1,-]> holoday </ERR> .
She is one of my good friends <ERR type=[pp1,0-4]> among </ERR> the past three years.
From the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> interchange </ERR> , we can know each other's study and life as well as before .
<ERR type=[pp1,0-4]> Between </ERR> the past three years, in the old school we always helped each other <ERR type=[vp2,5-4]> on </ERR> study as a <ERR type=[np3,9-0]> classmate </ERR> .
And after class, we would have heart-to-heart talks as a good <ERR type=[np3,8-0]> friend </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pp2,0-2]> To </ERR> this time, I understood the meaning of "A friend indeed is a friend in need.
A few days ago, when I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hurring </ERR> to go home, my bike suddenly broke down I must get it repaired.
I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> worring </ERR> what to do, Just then a student whom I did not know passed by, She gave me a five yuan note and hurried away.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Here </ERR> was no time for me to ask her name and which school she was in.
I love plum blossoms, <ERR type=[wd4,5-3]> though </ERR> have never seen it.
Because from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> anuent </ERR> to modern, countless great <ERR type=[np3,2-0]> writer </ERR> enjoyed it and writes a lot of poems and words win <ERR type=[fm1,-]> umiversal </ERR> praise to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eulogize </ERR> it.
In <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> the </ERR> history, plum blossoms was ever elected <ERR type=[vp1,5-6]> to </ERR> be the flower of our country.
So I have a dream, <ERR type=[wd4,4-8]> that </ERR> I will see it with my own eyes.
The new teachers went away <ERR type=[pp1,0-1]> in </ERR> Friday.
All of us didn't <ERR type=[vp1,4-2]> want </ERR> them left.
We liked them very much and <ERR type=[vp1,0-4]> looked </ERR> them as our friends.
Many classmates couldn't <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp8,3-3]> keed </ERR> back their tears <ERR type=[wd3,9-0]> too </ERR> .
At last, Mr Yang said to us: "We <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> were </ERR> so <ERR type=[wd2,5-2]> thanks </ERR> for you .
You're our first students in our teacher's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lefe </ERR> .
Though they left, we would <ERR type=[wd3,2-5]> usually </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> think </ERR> them again.
So <ERR type=[np7,0-8]> the </ERR> doctor makes money only if we are sick.
Consequently isn't it in the doctor's interest to wish everybody <ERR type=[vp3,4-1]> were </ERR> sick so e can make a lot of money?
I think doctors should only make money if we are <ERR type=[wd4,0-1]> healthy, </ERR> this way it would be in his interest to keep us healthy.
A national insurance program, I think, would achieve this <ERR type=[fm1,-][cc3,2-0]> resule </ERR> since doctors can then be encouraged to prevent sickness from <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp7,3-0]> occuring </ERR> .
Sports is good <ERR type=[pp1,3-1]> for </ERR> us.
It is very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> interesing </ERR> and exciting.
When I <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> is </ERR> playing it, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> very happy and it can improve friendship.
Because it <ERR type=[vp8,6-4]> must </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,4-3]> require </ERR> to cooperate well.
I like <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> watch </ERR> basketball match.
The programme name NBA is very <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> welcome </ERR> .
Sports can keep us healthy, I will <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> always </ERR> sport.
The <ERR type=[np2,1-1]> Moving </ERR> Star The <ERR type=[np2,1-1]> moving </ERR> star is the only star which we can watch it moves with our own eyes.
It often appears in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Summer </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Autumn </ERR> .
It is <ERR type=[vp2,2-3]> heart </ERR> that the wishes which <ERR type=[vp7,3-4]> promise </ERR> to the <ERR type=[np2,1-1]> moving </ERR> star will be realized.
I am very <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> regreted </ERR> that I have never caught sight of it.
But I think I will watch it in the future, at that time I will <ERR type=[cc3,0-2]> promise </ERR> my wish.
This story of the play happened <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> in </ERR> a professor's home.
He always <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> forget </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sth </ERR> unimportant, but <ERR type=[vp6,10-4]> remember </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sth </ERR> important.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beacause </ERR> he had just finished the papers of his invention.
The men <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> will </ERR> take his paper to London and then Professor Hunter <ERR type=[wd4,2-4][vp6,2-2]> will </ERR> very famous and the invention <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> will </ERR> greatly benefit the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whold </ERR> world.
They kidnapped the <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> true </ERR> men and took away their cards.
But Mr Hunter told them not to worry because he knew the <ERR type=[wd2,3-0]> true </ERR> at first and gave the men's paper were other papers.
The <ERR type=[fm3,-]> spring </ERR> Festival is coming.
When you walk on the street, you'll see everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> carry </ERR> many big <ERR type=[np3,2-0]> bag </ERR> and with smile in the face.
They will say "Hello" or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mod </ERR> .
If someone <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> knew </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,5-0]> each </ERR> , they'll say congratulation <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> for </ERR> each other.
<ERR type=[pp1,0-15]> On </ERR> the shop there <ERR type=[vp1,1-3]> have </ERR> many egg <ERR type=[np3,2-0]> roll </ERR> , cookies.
When you have a walk to the flower <ERR type=[fm1,-]> maket </ERR> , you'll see all kinds of flowers are on sale.
You can buy them <ERR type=[vp1,4-2]> to </ERR> your desk.
At first I must finish <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> doing </ERR> my holiday homework because <ERR type=[pr3,10-12]> they </ERR> were <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffcult </ERR> and I have little time to do them.
<ERR type=[wd5,0-1]> he </ERR> second I must lean the house to get ready for <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> through </ERR> the Spring Festival.

And we said all our heard and <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> saw </ERR> this year.
What they told me <ERR type=[vp3,4-2]> were </ERR> all interesting.
Some Strange <ERR type=[np3,2-0]> Tree </ERR>
There is a tree which is 170 years old in a village <ERR type=[wd5,12-4]> that </ERR> is in Jiang xi.
When someone touches it lightly, it will sway and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> leawies </ERR> let out some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> noice </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Aother </ERR> strange tree is in a school in the same <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prouince </ERR> .

As the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> story </ERR> happened in forest so the music is written with the flavour there, it's mysterious and fascinating.
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-5]> let </ERR> me feel the lion's nature.
<ERR type=[pp1,0-2]> At </ERR> the film the animals are so interesting that I can't <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> left </ERR> my eyes.

He came into the <ERR type=[wd3,4-0]> class </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> begaining </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd2,6-0]> teacher </ERR> the lesson.
When he said the "M" all of us <ERR type=[vp6,8-1]> were </ERR> laughing.
Because his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pronouncation </ERR> was strange.
The teacher's face <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> turn </ERR> red.

I hope I will make progress <ERR type=[wd3,5-2]> for </ERR> my study.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> Study </ERR> is very <ERR type=[aj4,4-]> tired </ERR> .
Many students are well in <ERR type=[wd3,-]> any </ERR> subjects in my class.
They are <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> study </ERR> very hard.
Sometimes they stay at school until the sun <ERR type=[vp7,-2]> was </ERR> went down.
So our teachers often <ERR type=[vp6,5-1]> praised </ERR> them.
Then the teachers' praise have greatly <ERR type=[vp3,6-1]> encouraged </ERR> them.
I must <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> be </ERR> study hard, too.
Because everyone <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> forward </ERR> .
Maths, physics, chemistry <ERR type=[wd4,4-1]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-]> worst </ERR> .
I hope <ERR type=[vp4,-]> try </ERR> my best to study.
[s8,s] Time is money for me.
I learned too <ERR type=[adj1,1-]> bad </ERR> for all the subject.
I make up my mind to study hard again and again, but I <ERR type=[ad1,-]> always </ERR> can not do this.
I believe through my <ERR type=[wd4,3-]> hard </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,3-]> that </ERR> I can win at last.
So I opened my books and went over the <ERR type=[np5,4-][wd3,4-]> knowledges </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[wd5,2-5]> was </ERR> often <ERR type=[fm1,-]> questione </ERR> to my classmates.

This week, we <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> have </ERR> maths testmany people not well , and my test was too bad.When I received my test paper, I was too supprised.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> is </ERR> too bad <ERR type=[cc6,1-]> truely </ERR> .
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> is </ERR> the worst matter for me.
I feel that <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> study </ERR> is too hard.
There are many <ERR type=[pr1,-]> people </ERR> study very well near me.
I <ERR type=[vp6,2-9][fm1,-]> belived </ERR> "Where there is a will, there is a way.
Today, all of the students went to the <ERR type=[np6,-]> sport </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> ground </ERR> for the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> sport </ERR> meeting of our school.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> is </ERR> cloudy, but everybody <ERR type=[vp3,3-3]> were </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,-]> high </ERR> very <ERR type=[ad2,3-]> much </ERR> .
Some <ERR type=[np6,2-]> student </ERR> joined the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> sport </ERR> meeting.
<ERR type=[np4,1-1]> Theirs </ERR> teachers and classmates encouraged them.
So they <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> were </ERR> harder and harder.
All the people <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> are </ERR> busy.
In the match, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> There </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> are </ERR> several <ERR type=[pr1,-]> students </ERR> had <ERR type=[vp1,-]> falled </ERR> , but they stood up and went on running.
I think if all of the students <ERR type=[wd2,6-1][vp3,6-1]> likes </ERR> them, then our tomorrow <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> will </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> beautiful </ERR> better.
In a school, we <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> learn </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> do </ERR> a <ERR type=[wd3,6-]> farmer </ERR> .
We <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> wake </ERR> up at a half to <ERR type=[np7,2-]> seven </ERR> in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> morning </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp6,1-2]> go </ERR> to bed at ten o'clock in the afternoon.
but we were happy, because we learned knowledge very <ERR type=[wd1,5-]> much </ERR> .
Everybody <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> were </ERR> often dirty very <ERR type=[ad2,6-]> much </ERR> .
[np6,-1] Teachers were like us.
All of us did <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> work </ERR> harder and harder.
Others <ERR type=[wd5,2-2]> always </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> help </ERR> him.
We <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> are </ERR> very friendly.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> In </ERR> the first day we <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> move </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> goods </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,5-2]> to </ERR> big house.
We worked the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whold </ERR> morning, we were wet.
(r)| , and I was sad very <ERR type=[ad2,5-]> much </ERR> .
Because I felt <ERR type=[wd3,1-5]> study </ERR> was very hard for me.
However, now, my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> and idiom <ERR type=[vp3,5-2]> was </ERR> too bad.
But I <ERR type=[wd4,2-6]> think </ERR> others could learn <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> so well, then I <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> could </ERR> like <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> this </ERR> , too.But first I must <ERR type=[wd4,2-4]> be </ERR> ?
it <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> was </ERR> my the largest enemy.
For the moment the most <ERR type=[wd4,3-6]> important </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,4-5]> is </ERR> do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> excersices </ERR> more and <ERR type=[wd1,3-]> more </ERR> <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> .At </ERR> the class carefully is surely.
Study's <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> way </ERR> is the most important for everybody.
So I must <ERR type=[wd5,3-1]> be </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-5]> find </ERR> the best way for <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> me </ERR> , too.
The new term was <ERR type=[vp4,5-]> come </ERR> .
After the spring <ERR type=[np6,4-]> holiday </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> all </ERR> the whole class was new.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> a new <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> started </ERR> .In the <ERR type=[np6,3-]> holiday </ERR> , everyone was happy.
All the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eople </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,4-3]> walk </ERR> in the street like "a ball", because we are <ERR type=[vp6,3-2][fm1,-]> wearing </ERR> too much.
And the <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> flowers </ERR> very beautiful, but not too expensive.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bough </ERR> flowers very much, especially roses.
In fact it's <ERR type=[vp6,2-]> right </ERR> we <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> are </ERR> happy to "happy hour".At last come back to school and begin to study again, I hope everyone "Everything goes well".
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> is </ERR> sunny.

The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whether </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,3-3][wd3,3-3]> is </ERR> better and better.

She <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> a young woman.
In the first <ERR type=[pp2,3-]> time </ERR> , she told us she was thirty years old that year.
In the years that followed, we knew that <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> he </ERR> taught Chinese and she always was very kind <ERR type=[wd3,6-1]> of </ERR> us.
In the following two years, she never <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> angrily </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-1]> for </ERR> us.
To we were <ERR type=[fm1,-1]> Great </ERR> Three, Miss Zhong left us.
We <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stated </ERR> to know some new teachers.
In the Spring <ERR type=[np6,3-]> Holiday </ERR> , she asked me to her office at once.
She gave me some cards and said "Happy <ERR type=[fm3,-]> new </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> year </ERR> " to me.
Everything <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> time </ERR> I was <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> happily </ERR> and thankful.
She was still kind <ERR type=[wd3,5-2]> of </ERR> her pupils and more beautiful .
For this Summer Holiday, today <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> the second day.
So I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> phone </ERR> all my old school friends.
At the same time, I met John, my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goods </ERR> friend for ten years.
We <ERR type=[wd3,2-6]> were </ERR> hand by <ERR type=[np2,3-]> hand </ERR> into <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> together.
We could see the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wated </ERR> was green and clear.
Some <ERR type=[np6,2-]> friend </ERR> couldn't help jumping and laughing, they jumped into it at once .The others went to get some <ERR type=[np5,1-]> foods </ERR> and soft-drinks, put them near the swimming pool.
At last, we were <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> jumped </ERR> into the water at all.
About two <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> years </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> late </ERR> ,we felt tired and hungry, so some were had a rest and said something to together.
Today, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Everything </ERR> was beautiful.
She said <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> the </ERR> she will <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> gave </ERR> me a <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> happiness </ERR> .
So I was <ERR type=[wd2,-]> surprise </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> want </ERR> to her home at once.
At this <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> time </ERR> , my friend came <ERR type=[fm3,-]> out, </ERR> She asked me with a smile "What do you think?
My friend told me that the dog was <ERR type=[wd3,4-4]> sent </ERR> by her brother's friend.
he liked <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> sleep </ERR> on people's legs and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> took the books on the floor.
Because he was only two years old, he must <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> to </ERR> drink milk.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> loved <ERR type=[vp4,1-]> smell </ERR> the flowers and <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> like </ERR> the white's particularly.
" In this day, <ERR type=[wd4,1-5]> "QQ" </ERR> already very kind <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> of </ERR> me and we made <ERR type=[wd3,-]> friend-ship </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pr1,1-]> It </ERR> likes <ERR type=[vp5,-]> used </ERR> the tail to say good-bye to me.
In the shop, <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> became large and more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> modernary </ERR> .
In the windows of children's clothes, some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perents </ERR> with their children looked through the windows.
Their children <ERR type=[wd5,3-5]> always </ERR> ran and jump around it.
They picked <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> out </ERR> the latest <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> modes </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> of </ERR> them and told their father or mother.
Everyday they <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> came </ERR> here early.
Some are buying something, some are <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> seeing </ERR> , some are the boss .
I find that the <ERR type=[wd4,2-4]> clothes </ERR> more beautiful than before.
Of course some are <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> much </ERR> expensive.
So they never make them disappointed <ERR type=[wd3,-]> together </ERR> .
China's four <ERR type=[fm1,-]> modenizations </ERR> will be <ERR type=[np7,-]> reality </ERR> .
People's living conditions <ERR type=[vp3,4-1]> is </ERR> improving.
We <ERR type=[fm1,-]> belive </ERR> that our country <ERR type=[vp9,3-2]> must </ERR> be <ERR type=[cc6,-1]> lovely </ERR> better in the future.
The new term <ERR type=[vp3,4-1]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,5-3][wd3,5-]> come </ERR> three weeks ago.
As we grew up, we <ERR type=[vp9,2-1]> can </ERR> feel knowledge is very important for every one.
We <ERR type=[vp9,2-1]> can </ERR> know that we <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> would </ERR> very busy in the coming days.
First, we must go to school in the evening though it rains <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> hardly </ERR> , and on Saturday -- the weekend, we must also <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> to </ERR> go o school all day long.
You can find a lot of students <ERR type=[vp5-]> study </ERR> harder than before.
You will find in these <ERR type=[np6,3-]> day </ERR> , classmates have become friendly.
So we felt thankful for <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> In </ERR> the teacher's day, every class in our school <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> all </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,7-3]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,8-2]> buy </ERR> some presents for our dear teachers.
When we sent <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> to our teachers, they looked <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> happily </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suprised </ERR> .
In our heart, we hoped our teachers <ERR type=[vp9,3-3][wd4,3-3]> can </ERR> beautiful and <ERR type=[aj3,3-]> beautiful </ERR> , become younger and younger.
they must be tired for us, <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> So </ERR> hope them happy <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> in </ERR> everyday.
Today, I <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> phoned </ERR> called my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goods </ERR> friend -- the old classmate of the Primary School.
We have not <ERR type=[wd3,4-4]> seen </ERR> for a long time.
So today, we felt having many words but could not say <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> something </ERR> .
He <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> said </ERR> about the <ERR type=[np6,2-]> person </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> something </ERR> we had remembered.
<ERR type=[np8,1-4]> Much </ERR> of the old classmates had changed.
We remembered what <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happed </ERR> between us all those <ERR type=[np6,2-]> day </ERR> .
Though <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> time <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> pass </ERR> by.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> We </ERR> felt <ERR type=[wd3,3-5]> many </ERR> of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> felling </ERR> have <ERR type=[vp3,8-2]> changed </ERR> each other, but we could not <ERR type=[wd4,-]> forget </ERR> "we <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> are </ERR> good friends.
" We never said "forever", but we both <ERR type=[vp6,4-]> know </ERR> that the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> friend-ship </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> grows </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,4-2]> up </ERR> with us, with the <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> following </ERR> days.
Yesterday, I read an <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> account </ERR> that <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> teach </ERR> people how to write with a pen on paper.
I felt that it <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> is </ERR> useful for me after I read it.
First, It <ERR type=[fm1,-]> taugh </ERR> us how to pick <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> a </ERR> ordinary pen for writing.
It said that a thicker pen <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fiter </ERR> more than <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> others.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> takes </ERR> us about a month to grasp a new pen's <ERR type=[cc3,5-]> use </ERR> .
It told <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> person </ERR> , <ERR type=[pr1,4-]> we </ERR> <ERR type=[vp7,2-4]> can </ERR> copy <ERR type=[pr4,-]> books' </ERR> good points.
Chinese characters <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> is </ERR> very interesting.
If our handwriting is good, so <ERR type=[pr1,1-2]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> is </ERR> good for our study or work.
Some people's handwriting <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> was </ERR> very good.
Not only be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paised </ERR> by others, but also improve their D?D?.
When my handwriting <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> was </ERR> good, I think I can receive <ERR type=[fm1,-][cc3,6-]> intereting </ERR> .
Yesterday, the two teachers of <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> practice </ERR> of our class left us.
All of us have <ERR type=[vp6,5-1]> felt </ERR> sad.
Because, the teachers have got well <ERR type=[vp2,6-1]> with </ERR> us for these days.
Not only <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> at </ERR> the class, but also after class.
o the <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> boy </ERR> was a beautiful watch, and <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> to </ERR> the girl was a lovely toy.
As the <ERR type=[np4,3-1]> teacher's </ERR> letter was read in the class.
I think all the <ERR type=[np6,3-3]> person </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,6-2]> are </ERR> have <ERR type=[np6,6-]> feeling </ERR> .
Nobody likes <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Good-bye </ERR> ' But it was the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ality </ERR> for us.
So we must keep back our tears at the quick <ERR type=[cc4,3-]> speed </ERR> ,and study harder than before.
When <ERR type=[wd4,2-4]> you </ERR> in the swimming-pool, <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> you </ERR> through the water, the feeling <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> was </ERR> good, you will feel soft.
[cc5,-] I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kow </ERR> two kinds of swimming.
In <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> that </ERR> days, I always <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> feel </ERR> very happy.
When I saw the water, I will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> jumped </ERR> .
When I jumped into the water, I felt <ERR type=[ad3,-][wd7,-]> highest </ERR> than before.
So I will like it <ERR type=[wd7,-]> last </ERR> .
Morning <ERR type=[fm1,-][np4,2-1]> excersises </ERR> match has <ERR type=[vp6,5-1]> been </ERR> on in our grade this Tuesday.
Everybody <ERR type=[wd3,2-5]> was </ERR> hard to do it best.
It seemed that it was <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> possibly </ERR> for us.
After the second lesson in the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> morning.We </ERR> ran to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> playgroud </ERR> of our school at once that like 100 metre race.
[sn,s] When the music began, we had already <ERR type=[vp2,4-1]> prepared </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,5-]> it </ERR> .
Soon <ERR type=[wd4,2-]> after </ERR> ,the match <ERR type=[fm1,-]> realy </ERR> began.
All of us <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> do </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,1-]> it </ERR> carefully.
During the match, we <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> can </ERR> saw that the teachers who saw us nodded with smile.
<ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> After </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-4]> match, </ERR> head of our class <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paised </ERR> us for it.
Miss <ERR type=[fm3,-]> bai </ERR> was happy and satisfied <ERR type=[vp2,2-1]> for </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,3-]> it </ERR> .
Sports are very useful and important for <ERR type=[vp4,3-2]> keep </ERR> people's health.
So we must do with it like this match after <ERR type=[pr1,5-]> it </ERR> .
There will <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> be </ERR> the men from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> he </ERR> government should <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> be </ERR> Professor's office to take his papers to London.
[sn,s] There <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> is </ERR> half an hour to the time of they <ERR type=[wd7,5-]> booked </ERR> .
They said they <ERR type=[vp6,4-3]> are </ERR> from the government, and they seemed to be <ERR type=[wd3,4-1]> too </ERR> nervous and were too anxious to leave.
So the Professor <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> give </ERR> them some papers from his books.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> about eleven o'clock, the time of they are .
They kidnapped the right men from London and took away their cards, hen they've <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> stolen </ERR> the invention.
[wd4, 1-] professor smiled and said, the papers <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> that </ERR> give vp6,4-1] them were wrong.
The papers of his invention were still <ERR type=[wd3,8-2]> in </ERR> his desk.
<ERR type=[wd4,-1]> Finally, </ERR> professor decided to take the papers to London himself.
My English was not <ERR type=[wd2,5-]> well </ERR> .
My <ERR type=[pr4,-]> English's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> base </ERR> was bad.
I am used <ERR type=[vp2,4-3]> to </ERR> forget the words, and it is <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> difficulty </ERR> to grasp the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> and some of the idioms for me.
For example, Once, I kept up my <ERR type=[vp2,5-3]> mind </ERR> to read aloud the text every morning.
It took me about ten to fifteen <ERR type=[fm1,-]> munites </ERR> .
This situation lasted <ERR type=[fm1,-]> seaval </ERR> days.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> In </ERR> the fifth day , I felt that <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> is </ERR> too much for me, So I didn't stick to it.
<ERR type=[wd2,15-]> Lazy </ERR> is my <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> most </ERR> shortcoming.
I thought <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> that </ERR> must <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> be </ERR> get rid of it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> otherwise, </ERR> it <ERR type=[vp9,2-4]> must </ERR> effect me very much.
My Winter <ERR type=[np6,3-]> Holiday </ERR>
The winter <ERR type=[np6,3-3]> holiday </ERR> was very short.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> is </ERR> at <ERR type=[wd3,-]> least </ERR> two weeks.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> Except </ERR> the Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festerval </ERR> , it <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> about seven days to study.
I <ERR type=[vp6,2-]> know </ERR> that <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> the important time for us to study.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Teathers </ERR> often said that study n fact <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> is </ERR> this.
In this holiday, I often <ERR type=[wd3,-]> remember </ERR> to go over my lessons.
I noticed everyone <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> studies </ERR> very hard in the days before this holiday.
But I found that <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> is </ERR> the most important thing to do everything <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> is </ERR> hard.
So after the test, they could <ERR type=[vp6,1-]> smiled </ERR> <ERR type=[cc5,4-]> aloud </ERR> from their hearts.
Although I <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> was </ERR> not very clever, I will go on to study hard in this term.
The Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festerval </ERR>
<ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> At </ERR> the night before "The Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festerval </ERR> ",my <ERR type=[np6,2-][fm1,-]> perant </ERR> ,and me <ERR type=[vp6,5-3][wd3,5-3]> walk </ERR> "the flower street".
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> near my home, then very *1/2?
<ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> At </ERR> the street, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> There </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> are </ERR> many flowers <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> in </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> it </ERR> .
Some <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> are </ERR> red, some <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> are </ERR> yellow, some <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> are </ERR> green and so on.
Although the night was raining <ERR type=[cc2,2-]> , </ERR> people much more than before .
<ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> In </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festerval </ERR> , I stayed at home almost every day.
Because the whether was very cold and I wanted <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> to </ERR> in bed instead.
But I <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> phone </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> call </ERR> my friends to say "Happy <ERR type=[fm3,-]> new </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> year </ERR> !
At my home, it <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> is </ERR> very warm, I was lazy to out .
Sometimes, my old school friends <ERR type=[vp1,-]> called </ERR> me, and said some beautiful words to me.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> is </ERR> much happier for me.
I wish all the people who I knew "Happy <ERR type=[fm3,-]> new </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> year </ERR> ".
Before the Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festerval </ERR> , my friend <ERR type=[vp6,3-1][wd3,3-1]> do </ERR> shopping with me.
Many flowers and oranges <ERR type=[vp3,57-]> was </ERR> put at the gate of the shops.
<ERR type=[pr1,1-3]> It </ERR> looked beautiful.
In the shops, my friends and me wanted to buy something, but all the <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> things </ERR> very expensive.
For the Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festerval </ERR> , we must buy some clothes or anything else.
At the end of the <ERR type=[pp1,5-]> time </ERR> , we bought <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> much </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> something </ERR> to eat <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> after </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> all </ERR> .
We jumped, ran, smiled <ERR type=[cc5,2-]> aloud </ERR> in the street.
At the age of seventeen, <ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> it </ERR> is the <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> beautiful </ERR> age <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> of </ERR> every one.
We will remember this age <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> at </ERR> our life.
I remembered the days that my old school friends had played <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> at </ERR> the streets and roads with me liked at that time.
At the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> day </ERR> , we were all younger than today.
At the end of this holiday, <ERR type=[wd7,-4]> tomorrow </ERR> will go to school, the term will be <ERR type=[vp1,5-]> begun </ERR> .
At <ERR type=[pr1,-]> this </ERR> time, I feel excited and a little frightened.
[fm1,-] I read the words one by one.
I <ERR type=[vp9,2-1]> could </ERR> know that would <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> be </ERR> become my knowledge.I read the texts <ERR type=[cc5,5-4]> louder </ERR> as <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> nobody </ERR> near me.
I was careful in <ERR type=[pr1,5-]> it </ERR> .
Sometimes, I turn on the radio and listen to the songs or the DJ's voice <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> voice </ERR> .
It can make me <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mopre </ERR> <ERR type=[aj4,4-]> relaxing </ERR> then ever.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Wxpecially </ERR> the songs <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Englilsh </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Altough </ERR> some of them I could not understand all about it.
"Say you, say me","Right here waiting" "Unchained Melody" "Nothing's gonna change my love for you" <ERR type=[fm1,-]> "Casablance </ERR> " and so on.
In the years that followed I wish <ERR type=[cc3,3-3]> everyday </ERR> happier than ever.
With <ERR type=[np5,2-2]> times </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,3-1]> go </ERR> by, our study has <ERR type=[cc2,4-3]> become </ERR> busier and busier.
All of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> students </ERR> in our grade have <ERR type=[vp6,9-5]> studied </ERR> harder and harder than ever.
<ERR type=[pp1,-]> In </ERR> the lessons , we take an <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp2,3-]> ative </ERR> in <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> put </ERR> up our hands to answer the questions.
After <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> a </ERR> class, most of us will have a rest or go out of the classroom.
We don't stay <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> in </ERR> classroom to read the textbook any more.
Our teachers and parents worry a bit <ERR type=[wd3,4-1]> for </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,4-]> it </ERR> .
If we could do it <ERR type=[ad1,6-]> really </ERR> , it <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> is </ERR> not too <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> difficulty </ERR> to study well.
<ERR type=[wd5,1-]> But </ERR> when we do it for sometime, we <ERR type=[vp9,2-4]> could </ERR> find it was true.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> friends, <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> make </ERR> up <ERR type=[np4,5-1]> our </ERR> mind to study hard in these more than one year, and <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> stick </ERR> to do <ERR type=[pr1,4-]> this </ERR> .Don't give up when <ERR type=[pr1,-]> our </ERR> fail.
We must believe that "Where, there is a will, there is <ERR type=[np7,-]> way </ERR> .
In the classroom, everyone <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> looks </ERR> better then ever.
So it can <ERR type=[cc2,3-]> find </ERR> that <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> a </ERR> good sleep and good food <ERR type=[vp6,6-6]> was </ERR> important for men's health and <ERR type=[np5,1-]> works </ERR> .
It's <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> being </ERR> fine today.
On the contrary, we did our best to listen carefully <ERR type=[wd5,-]> that </ERR> what the teacher had said.
Teachers <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> look </ERR> happy for we do this, and then made up their mind to make us study better then before.
English is an interesting <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> thing </ERR> .
I think I must use my <ERR type=[wd3,5-2]> head </ERR> to think <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> that </ERR> what <ERR type=[wd1,1-2]> shall </ERR> I do and be good at it.
First, I must encourage myself and in front of the <ERR type=[ad1,5-]> mirror </ERR> to say to myself "Don't give up.
Many students who graduated <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> in </ERR> our school became famous.
There are one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thouands </ERR> and eight hundred students and more than two hundred teachers in it.
It has two teaching <ERR type=[np6,1-]> building </ERR> , <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> a </ERR> experiment <ERR type=[np2,2-]> building </ERR> and a big playground.
They are always <ERR type=[fm1,-]> trick </ERR> with us and we respect them.
There are less than a <ERR type=[wd7,2-1]> hard </ERR> month <ERR type=[wd3,8-5]> to </ERR> the graduation examine for us.
In our grade, most of the students study harder and harder, and the <ERR type=[wd7,-]> nearer </ERR> the harder.
Teachers and <ERR type=[pr1,2-]> we </ERR> devote ourselves to study.
Sometimes our <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> teachers </ERR> <ERR type=[aj3,3-2]> eagerer </ERR> than us.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Somtimes </ERR> , we study hard <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> midnight.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> then </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> in </ERR> the day, we feel <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> asleep </ERR> .From then on , we study to night no longer.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> At </ERR> class we rather listen carefully than study so <ERR type=[ad2,3-]> tired </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> At </ERR> class, students listen more <ERR type=[wd2,4-4]> careful </ERR> then any other time.
We wish to <ERR type=[wd2,-]> exam </ERR> well.

[vp6,4-] Crusoe brought two guns, but the two canoes were almost out of sight.
And he found the bones were <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> not </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,5-1]> the </ERR> animal, but <ERR type=[wd3,2-2][vp6,2-2]> is </ERR> human being.
Crusoe made up his mind to shoot them if they <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> came </ERR> again.
Saturday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> cloudy </ERR>
I felt <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tried </ERR> after I did the homework and went over the text.
Soon I <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> heard </ERR> Dj's sweet voice.
[vp6,s-] So I went to see the rain.
Oh, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It </ERR> was one o'clock , but I felt I enjoyed myself.
It <ERR type=[vp6,2-10]> is </ERR> already seven years since I began to study English.
when I was a pupil of Grade Four, I touched English first <ERR type=[pp1,1-]> time </ERR> .
) when the test was over, I was so sad that I had <ERR type=[vp6,12-2]> made </ERR> the <ERR type=[vp2,16-2]> mind </ERR> .
After this, I <ERR type=[wd3,-]> took </ERR> my heart into English, and <ERR type=[vp6,9-3]> study </ERR> hard and carefully.
It is my old <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frind </ERR> for helping my English.
And the dictionary is very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> usful </ERR> .
I often look up the new words while I read and I <ERR type=[vp6,13-3]> can't </ERR> understand the sentence.
So <ERR type=[fm1,-]> It </ERR> not only helps me get the meanings of new words, but also helps me understand an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> articl </ERR> well.
<ERR type=[pp1,1-5]> Among </ERR> these days, e all took our heart <ERR type=[pp1,10-3]> into </ERR> our study.
But I had <ERR type=[vp6,11-3]> filled </ERR> in both test.
<ERR type=[pr1,1-8]> It </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,8-8]> is </ERR> the reason <ERR type=[pr5,4-4]> that </ERR> why I had filled.
I was so lazy that I did <ERR type=[aj3,7-11]> less </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exersices </ERR> for my study.
Especially <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> physics, though there were such single <ERR type=[np3,5-2]> problems </ERR> , I had <ERR type=[vp7,9-1]> defeated </ERR> .
Several days <ERR type=[wd3,3-11]> before </ERR> , I heard that there was a small bookshop nearby 6,8-2] my school.
l the books that <ERR type=[vp6,5-7][vp3,5-7]> is </ERR> old were much cheaper than the others.
Because some of the books which were sold outside <ERR type=[vp6,10-5]> do </ERR> not fit us very well, some books which <ERR type=[vp6,20-6]> fit </ERR> us but it <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> sell </ERR> very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spensive </ERR> .
But it <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> is </ERR> too small for me to find out.
There were so many people in it and everyone put their heart <ERR type=[vp2,12-5]> into </ERR> choosing books which they <ERR type=[vp6,17-1]> need </ERR> .
In the end, I was so pleased that I bought some <ERR type=[wd4,-]> very </ERR> books which I <ERR type=[vp6,13-1]> need </ERR> .
Just t that time, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hided </ERR> the newspaper at once, and took out the textbook and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pretened </ERR> to read carefully.
I noticed that other put a cup of milk on my desk without any noise and went <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> out </ERR> my room <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lighty </ERR> .
<ERR type=[vp4,1-2]> Looked </ERR> at this cup of milk, I understood what mother meant at all.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Though </ERR> the window, I saw a rainy world.
The street which I <ERR type=[vp6,12-2]> live </ERR> in was a few people.
<ERR type=[pr1,11-6]> This </ERR> included a group of little children.
Some of them <ERR type=[vp1,4-8]> dressed </ERR> the <ERR type=[np7,7-1]> rain-coat </ERR> , some of them took umbrellas.
From the children, I <ERR type=[vp6,4-5]> can </ERR> see myself in the children.
At that time, we didn't understand what was unhappy and what was the word "exam" <ERR type=[vp7,15-0]> meant </ERR> .
I know because of <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> exam </ERR> , I lose a lot of things which I like.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> thinking </ERR> of my study.
I left the window and turned <ERR type=[cc3,6-2]> on </ERR> my book.
[wd4,-] Cloudy
Recently, I have read a story about a boy <ERR type=[wd2,-]> suiciding </ERR> .
If you want to find true friends, at first <ERR type=[pr1,9-8]> we </ERR> must help others where they are in trouble and need <ERR type=[pr4,13-1]> you </ERR> help.

Let me say a <ERR type=[wd3,4-16]> world </ERR> , "Mother, happy birthday to you!
However we had tests each day and we have learned much <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> knowledge </ERR> .
I like Autumn very much, because it is not <ERR type=[fm1,-]> noly </ERR> a nice season but a harvest-time.
We were going to do some <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> working </ERR> what to clean the classroom in the morning.
As it was raining hard, we didn't do these <ERR type=[np5,4-0]> works </ERR> .
Teachers were asked to give classes <ERR type=[wd3,6-1]> with </ERR> Chinese.
Each teacher spoke Chinese the <ERR type=[wd2,5-0]> different </ERR> .
We <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> couldn't </ERR> what they said.
Chinese is our <ERR type=[wd6,-]> our </ERR> native language, every one of us should learn to <ERR type=[wd3,15-2]> say </ERR> it well.
We held a sports-meet in the <ERR type=[np4,2-2]> Workers </ERR> Stadium today.
Many students also wrote articles, because each one would <ERR type=[vp1,3-5]> contend </ERR> one mark for each class.
The contest was so wonderful that we often couldn't help <ERR type=[wd3,-]> standing </ERR> to watch.
We stopped to <ERR type=[vp5,3-0]> talking </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> encouraged </ERR> her to study hard to make a rapid progress, she also encouraged me to keep <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> in </ERR> studying carefully.
We talked for some time and finally we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bidded </ERR> farewell to each other.
<ERR type=[pr4,0-4]> She's </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> illess </ERR> was so serious that she must have an operation.
I regretted that I <ERR type=[vp6,4-10]> have </ERR> no time to see her only because of hard study.
I should go to see her sometime <ERR type=[ad1,7-0]> surely </ERR> .
In order to make good results in the <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> middle </ERR> exam, I decided to go over each subject carefully.
It was good for me to <ERR type=[wd3,6-4]> grasp </ERR> the life of farmer.
Half a term passed, the year is also going to pass, and I will be sixteen, I hoped I <ERR type=[vp9,3-6]> could </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,7-4]> go </ERR> to university after three ears, however my study was so bad, at the same time I was very discouraged, I didn't know how to improve it.
I was afraid of the <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> middle </ERR> exam after all, but it was the reality, I had to <ERR type=[vp1,3-0]> accept </ERR> .
We had had the <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> middle </ERR> exam the week before last <ERR type=[wd5,-0]> week </ERR> .
All of us were covered with mud, but we <ERR type=[vp6,9-1]> don't </ERR> mind.
needed <ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> the </ERR> great power o transport, so that we felt very tired.
We cooked and <ERR type=[vp6,3-5]> have </ERR> the picnic on the hill.
Though the dish was very bad, we had it with <ERR type=[wd3,-]> relish </ERR> .All the things were instructive.
On Friday evening, <ERR type=[wd4,3-5]> school </ERR> had held a patriarch meeting.
Mr Zhu gave every parent a result form which was printed the results of every subject of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hold </ERR> class.
I was the twenty-second in class and the <ERR type=[np9,8-3]> sixty-two </ERR> in the grade, though I made a little progress, it was 85 marks between <ERR type=[pr4,5-5]> I </ERR> and the first after all.
Our school's Festival of Art would <ERR type=[vp7,6-0]> hold </ERR> .
I also took part in the match of reading English, I seldom read at ordinary times, so <ERR type=[wd5,9-6]> that </ERR> I must read more these days.
The film's name was "The thing changed <ERR type=[pp1,0-3]> in </ERR> July the seventh <ERR type=[pp1,0-3]> in </ERR> Lu Go Bridge", it was the start of the struggle and was instructive, I knew many history things figures from the film, the Japanese Army's members were free to murdered the Chinese people, I hated them.
The struggle <ERR type=[vp8,2-8]> wasn't </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hictory </ERR> <ERR type=[cj1,4-4]> unless </ERR> the Chinese Communist Party.
I hoped Mr Zhu <ERR type=[wd7,4-7]> regulated </ERR> the seats as early as he could.
I had been in that place <ERR type=[wd4,7-1]> for </ERR> long <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tie </ERR> .
I wondered if the floor was swept the last <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> days </ERR> .
I would learn Lesson Seven, which <ERR type=[vp4,1-3]> named </ERR> "The Emperor's Clothes".
They told the emperor the clothes made of <ERR type=[pr1,27-16]> it </ERR> could not be see by the stupid or the men who <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ere </ERR> unfit for their work.
The emperor agreed to let hem make the invisible clothes in <ERR type=[wd3,11-13]> other </ERR> to find out which men in his empire was unfit for his offices.
Then they <ERR type=[wd4,3-7]> thought </ERR> were stupid or were unfit for their work.
They told the emperor the clothes was excellent in order to let him <ERR type=[wd1,5-7]> not </ERR> know they were unfit for their work.
The emperor "saw" it and <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> sing </ERR> high praise for it.
He believed he cheats at <ERR type=[cc5,5-0]> all </ERR> .
But the emperor still held his head, the two officials who were following him even <ERR type=[vp6,17-6]> pretend </ERR> to hold up the emperor's train.
I took <ERR type=[pp1,-]> part </ERR> the matches of the art festival, which were to create the poems and songs and to read aloud the English.
Tomorrow will be <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> Christmas </ERR> .
I received many cards of <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> christmas </ERR> from my friends.
I like <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> the </ERR> New Year's Day more than <ERR type=[wd5,0-1]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> christmas </ERR> , because I have the holiday <ERR type=[pp1,5-3]> in </ERR> New Year's Day but not on <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> christmas </ERR> .
Most of them went out for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shoping </ERR> , for travelling or for park I stayed at home this morning.
I read the newspapers as I listened to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> recoder </ERR> .
But these had passed, the most important thing to me <ERR type=[vp6,10-8]> is </ERR> how to do better in he new year.
Yesterday evening, I went <ERR type=[wd5,2-4]> to </ERR> shopping with my parents.
While we walked along the Shang Jiu Road, we saw there were many people <ERR type=[vp4,6-9]> stood </ERR> around a stage of Literature d art radio station, we also saw a singer singing on it.
Jan 6th, 1996 Saturday <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Cloudly </ERR>
It was very hard to go over every <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> subjects </ERR> well.
But I ought to get rid of the <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> thinking, </ERR> try my best to do best.
Jun 13th,1996 Saturday <ERR type=[fm3,-]> cloudy </ERR> Now I will rite the end of the story about the emperor's new clothes.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prossion </ERR> continued.
He ordered to stop the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prossion </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sudently </ERR> and cried loud, "Be quiet!
" The people topped crying and they began to be frightened <ERR type=[pp1,5-2]> with </ERR> the emperor.
It proved all my officials were unfit for their work and they were not honest <ERR type=[pp1,4-1]> for </ERR> me".
Then he faced the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> officals </ERR> .
Of course the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> officals </ERR> didn't see the emperor with one eye .
Ha..." Then most of the people took up his words and they also aid the emperor knew <ERR type=[pr4,3-3]> his </ERR> made a mistake, but he didn't <ERR type=[wd3,3-7]> accept </ERR> the mistake because he was an emperor, instead he wanted to drive off the people and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> officals </ERR> .
He cried, " How dare you <ERR type=[vp9,3-1]> said </ERR> that!
Don't <ERR type=[vp9,1-3]> lived </ERR> in this empire!
" The people and the officials were also angry, they took <ERR type=[fm1,-]> awy </ERR> everything from the palace and left the empire right away.
This afternoon we didn't have classes, thus I had a bit <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> pleasures </ERR> .
In the holidays, I could be free to do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ething </ERR> that I was glad to do.
I went to Tian He Bookshop with my cousins and my aunt, we saw a <ERR type=[wd1,-2]> foreign </ERR> lovely baby who sat in cradle, he laughed towards us.
I also had met my old <ERR type=[wd4,7-2]> classmates, </ERR> my old teachers.
In the Spring Festival, I <ERR type=[vp2,1-5]> didn't </ERR> afraid of he cold weather, I <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> dressed </ERR> the beautiful clothing and wore a air of new shoes to visit the relatives and friends.

There was some bread which was <ERR type=[vp1,6-2]> rising </ERR> hot team ,it smelt good.
She asked me: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "excuse </ERR> me, little boy, how much was that bread?

She is a girl at <ERR type=[pp1,1-]> all </ERR> !
<ERR type=[wd4,0-4]> " </ERR> laughed and left the shop.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> At </ERR> the first, our classmates rowed the fastest.
I had <ERR type=[vp6,2-8]> learned </ERR> Lesson Thirteen, now let me retell the text.
One day Robinson Crusoe caught sight of the footprint of a <ERR type=[np4,4-3]> man's </ERR> in the sand while he was walking along the sands towards his boat.
The island was very <ERR type=[ad2,1-]> silent </ERR> , Crusoe wondered if there were some savages there, he looked round.
He decided to go back and <ERR type=[vp2,6-10]> look </ERR> the footmark again to prove if the footmark was his.
There must be someone <ERR type=[fm1,-]> elso </ERR> on the island.
He was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> terried </ERR> at the result.
One morning of autumn, he saw nine savages which were sitting round a fire and eating something <ERR type=[vp4,17-3]> were </ERR> one the shore.
Crusoe made up <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> mind </ERR> to shoot the savages if they came again, because they killed their enemies and ate them.
To my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disappointant </ERR> , the results were all bad.
But am not fond of rain after all, I don't <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> hope </ERR> it rains that much.

I have <ERR type=[cc3,2-3]> understood </ERR> much Chinese knowledge in this trip.
Last night, suddenly, there <ERR type=[vp1,1-4]> raised </ERR> a shout of help, which got around our <ERR type=[wd3,-]> storey </ERR> .
They had a baby who was only over one years old <ERR type=[vp4,11-3]> was </ERR> terrified at them .
Mr s' child is a lovely baby, she often <ERR type=[cc3,4-2]> fills </ERR> with smile and often says hello to us.
Please give the baby a <ERR type=[wd3,5-4]> still </ERR> and a warm family!
Yesterday I've <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> attended </ERR> an activity which my old good friends organized.
We baked food in Bi Yun Mountain and talked about everyone's <ERR type=[wd3,11-0]> circumstances </ERR> .
They didn't <ERR type=[vp2,2-2]> take </ERR> great changes, they still had many words to talk with me.
Perhaps we <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> gather </ERR> again after two years because our studies are more and more <ERR type=[cc4,6-0]> nervous </ERR> .
I have to stay at school all the day as my home is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> faraway </ERR> from school.
I had <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> took </ERR> part in the sports meet of <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> school </ERR> .
I always ran very slowly, this time I'm to run 400 metres, I thought trying is the beginning of success and to run 400 metres <ERR type=[vp9,5-2]> needn't </ERR> very fast, I will do hat I can to practise.
I am <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> spending </ERR> on holiday.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> At </ERR> same time, I'm doing my homework.
This is a really <ERR type=[ad2,4-1]> particularly </ERR> holiday, I can't laugh, but I will think about the happy things.
<ERR type=[wd4,1-5]> There </ERR> many stars in the dark sky.
On that night, we also took photos and danced <ERR type=[pp1,6-3]> on </ERR> the dance hall.
Dance <ERR type=[cj1,1-2]> as </ERR> I couldn't, I could learn.
After all those happy things had <ERR type=[vp6,6-7]> passed </ERR> , I have to face the home <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> work </ERR> .
Though I want to play, I <ERR type=[vp2,6-8]> see </ERR> study is the most important job for me.
This <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> was </ERR> first time to forget writing a diary.
I could have had a rest after class, but for <ERR type=[pr1,10-5]> this </ERR> , I had to give up.
This morning I was <ERR type=[wd3,4-9]> hardly </ERR> late for school.
Because when I was going upstairs, there were many students going downstairs, I was <ERR type=[vp1,2-3]> prevented </ERR> to go up.
Please <ERR type=[fm1,-]> parden </ERR> me writing the diary too badly.
The weather was nice and the cool wind <ERR type=[fm2,-]> brashed </ERR> us.
Scores of colour balloons <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rised </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> upword </ERR> the blue sky, with the march <ERR type=[wd3,3-0]> rising </ERR> .
Though I had tried my best to run, I ran hardly the stone yet, I had thought I had no name in the fore, luckily, I got the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forth </ERR> because there were a few runners <ERR type=[vp4,12-2]> broke </ERR> the rules.
I didn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> regrate </ERR> taking part in the match, I had <ERR type=[cc3,4-3]> got </ERR> to the purpose which <ERR type=[wd4,11-5]> was </ERR> I could temper my body.
On the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> might </ERR> of yesterday, after having the self-study class, I went home as usual.
When I reached the corner of the road, I couldn't <ERR type=[vp2,2-3]> keep </ERR> up going forward.
Because there <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ere </ERR> many people around the road .
I lifted my head and saw a few <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perlicemen </ERR> among them.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> surposed </ERR> there must have broken out an accident.
I didn't stand there walking, I hurried home <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> through </ERR> another road.
Today is lunar calendar <ERR type=[fm3,-]> september </ERR> the ninth, it is the festival <ERR type=[vp4,4-4]> belongs </ERR> to the old men.
Our <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> practical </ERR> teachers had left in Friday.
I was <ERR type=[vp7,12-3]> moving </ERR> at that time, but I didn't cry, I made up my mind to work hard to requite them.
We <ERR type=[ad1,1-5]> finally </ERR> can have two days' holiday.
I <ERR type=[vp6,12-2]> am </ERR> still busy.
The light-assessment is <ERR type=[vp7,3-7]> carrying </ERR> out, we have done better than before.
Such as the morning exercise, the eyes exercise and the cleaning work , as soon as the bell rang, we all quickly went downstairs to the playground; every day, the students who were on duty had swept the patches <ERR type=[vp4,12-13]> belongs </ERR> to our class and watered the flowers before the other students came back.
But we were still the third in our grade, that was to say, we still had something that we haven't <ERR type=[vp6,9-1]> done </ERR> well.
The <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> middle-exam </ERR> is coming.
Because it can <ERR type=[cc3,7-3]> practise </ERR> a man's will and can make the muscles of the legs stronger.
Table tennis is an interesting, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> jobful </ERR> and relaxing sport.
I also like playing badminton, it can practise all my body, especially the arm, will get more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strengthful </ERR> .
As the first, course, I had some pain <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> of </ERR> my hands.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Basetball </ERR> is a good sport, too.
It has the <ERR type=[cc4,3-3]> best </ERR> value to me, because it can make me taller.
I cared much for grandpa's health and <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> cousin's </ERR> study.
I was glad that there was no <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> matter </ERR> with my grandpa and my cousin had made progress in her study.
I hoped my little cousin would get sensible and <ERR type=[aj3,9-0]> sensible </ERR> .
The men from the government were going to help <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Propessor </ERR> Hunter take his papers to London.
They were <ERR type=[wd5,21-1]> the </ERR> impostors.
Dec 15th , 1996 Sunday <ERR type=[fm1,-]> loudy </ERR>
Because If I were late, I would wait <ERR type=[wd3,8-3]> for </ERR> a long line.
At about ten past twelve, I have <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> returned </ERR> the classroom, then I turn on the radio to listen to the story.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> During </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,3-1]> the </ERR> noon, I will do some homework and have a rest for minutes.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Seince </ERR> we have self-study <ERR type=[np6,6-3]> class </ERR> in the evening, I must go out to take my bicycle back to school.
During the course of the <ERR type=[cc4,-]> artist </ERR> festival, all <ERR type=[pp1,8-6]> over </ERR> the school are busy in it.
I also took part in the brush-handwriting I had not practised for a long time, so I wrote rather <ERR type=[ad2,3-0]> bad </ERR> .
Though I couldn't get many scores for my class, I was ready to, <ERR type=[pr5,13-4]> whether </ERR> only a few scores.
The artist festival creased my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> knowladge </ERR> and built my ambition.
That <ERR type=[wd3,7-5]> shows </ERR> the final exam is coming.
Perhaps the people of Hong Kong will not <ERR type=[wd3,8-9]> fit </ERR> the new systems at the beginning of the period of coming back .
but I think, only they realize they are the Chinese people they will <ERR type=[wd3,2-4]> fit </ERR> the new systems well.
This job <ERR type=[wd3,2-7]> concludes </ERR> wiping the windows, the cupboards and frames; washing the curtains , the floor, and the doors.
At last, we must hurry <ERR type=[vp4,3-8]> get </ERR> ready for the dinner on New Year's Eve.
Because there will come my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammother </ERR> , my uncles, my aunts, and my brothers and sisters to have dinner on that evening.
So in the afternoon I took <ERR type=[np7,2-1]> a </ERR> umbrella and wore a pair of rain-boots to go downstairs.
Though the rain continued <ERR type=[vp4,-]> dropping </ERR> , the floor was very wet, many people still went out from home with great joy.
I reached a food-shop, there stood many people, as a kind of food was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> popular </ERR> , I had to buy it in line.
They are new head teachers , they are from Hua <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lan </ERR> School.
Our Chinese will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> insteaded </ERR> by them .
How they introduced <ERR type=[fm2,-]> themself </ERR> to us is very interesting.
One of them <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> said </ERR> her name, then told us her telephone <ERR type=[wd4,14-15]> umber, </ERR> asked us to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plone </ERR> her, so that we could talk about what we want to <ERR type=[wd3,10-0]> speak </ERR> .
They must have many ideas and <ERR type=[cc4,6-1]> good </ERR> knowledge.
We will <ERR type=[wd3,2-6]> study </ERR> a lot of things from them.
I really <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> welcome </ERR> two new <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> teacher </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> people </ERR> said tonight's moon was very much.

The No.4 Middle school held the <ERR type=[np6,-]> sport </ERR> meeting last week.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> This </ERR> meeting <ERR type=[vp7,4-2]> separated </ERR> two <ERR type=[wd7,6-0]> times </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> one </ERR> was <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> firday </ERR> afternoon, other was <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> Saturday morning.

Everywhere we can find <ERR type=[wd5,4-1]> the </ERR> laughing.
I paid attention to <ERR type=[fm2,-]> every-place </ERR> .
I was <ERR type=[aj4,2-2]> interesting </ERR> in <ERR type=[fm2,-]> runing </ERR> .
Something else <ERR type=[vp6,8-2]> is </ERR> also interesting.
The students who took part <ERR type=[wd4,5-6]> in </ERR> were very friendly to each other.
This week we have learned Lesson <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Five-winter </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> sleep </ERR> .
It <ERR type=[wd3,1-7]> induced </ERR> some animal how to <ERR type=[vp5,4-2]> spent </ERR> the winter.
I have <ERR type=[cc3,2-9]> known </ERR> a great of knowledge about these from the lesson.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> all know the cold blooded animal must hibernate in winter, but do you know some <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> animal </ERR> need to sleep in summer.
If they <ERR type=[wd2,-]> movement </ERR> all day, they will lose water and be very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tried </ERR> , until they die from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hotten </ERR> .
For this they had to sleep, but their <ERR type=[np4,2-5]> sleep's </ERR> time is shorter than hibernation.
it is <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Sunday </ERR> .
After I have breakfast, I would go over <ERR type=[fm1,-]> texs </ERR> , till half past ten, and then I watch TV.
In a week I hardly have time to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wathc </ERR> TV.
Because home <ERR type=[cc1,2-3]> words </ERR> are too many.
At four o'clock, I will see football match <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> in </ERR> TV.
In the night I will go <ERR type=[wd4,6-1]> over </ERR> , too.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> next </ERR> I go to bed.
Sometimes I go to <ERR type=[np6,4-4]> library </ERR> and borrow some books.

I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> decied </ERR> to learn English harder after I <ERR type=[wd3,-]> heard </ERR> this lesson.
" And "How Li Yan learn English:" are different in <ERR type=[wd7,3-0]> way </ERR> .
I received the <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> back </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,6-0]> one </ERR> , because I think it will fit me.
I think I will <ERR type=[cc3,4-3]> beat </ERR> English before long.
We got to Xi Zhao Hill by bus, having two half <ERR type=[cc4,-]> hours </ERR> ride.
The Xi Zhao Hill is much larger and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> highter </ERR> than any other hill in Guang <ERR type=[fm1,-]> zhou </ERR> .
The Hill is so beautiful that it leads to bring many people's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comeing </ERR> , for example: students, peasants, workers, <ERR type=[wd5,7-2]> the </ERR> foreign friends.
But everywhere <ERR type=[fm1,-]> monry </ERR> is the most necessary.
People there want many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> monry </ERR> very much.
If you reach same place, you must <ERR type=[cc3,2-4]> play </ERR> some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> monry </ERR> for visiting, " No <ERR type=[fm1,-]> monny </ERR> No talk" This word is fit for the Hill .
4 Middle school now, you must feel very <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> surprise </ERR> .
Because you can't see the old school, which you have <ERR type=[wd3,10-1]> even </ERR> seen.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Mony </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> builting </ERR> have been knocked down.
The workers are <ERR type=[ad1,3-1]> hard </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> builting </ERR> .
All the students try <ERR type=[vp2,4-3]> own's </ERR> best to help.
They give a great deal of good <ERR type=[np1,5-0][np6,7-0]> idea </ERR> in order to make the school more beautiful.
The work of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rebuilting </ERR> the school is all the students and teachers' wish.
We hope all of us could live in a quite beautiful great space to <ERR type=[cc3,0-1]> earn </ERR> knowledge.
I think when the school <ERR type=[fm2,-]> finishs </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rebutlling </ERR> , I <ERR type=[vp6,12-2]> have </ERR> left here.
But I don't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> regrad </ERR> .
That day isn't very <ERR type=[wd3,12-0]> long </ERR> .
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning..... And he was going to give his invention to all <ERR type=[wd5,10-2]> over </ERR> the world, because of loving all <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> human </ERR> .
He would give his invention <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> without </ERR> nothing.
Two men who were cheats, came to <ERR type=[wd5,7-7]> the </ERR> Hunter's home and asked for the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inventio </ERR> .But Hunter was very clever and careful in his invention.
He found <ERR type=[wd4,-]> that </ERR> two men weren't like the right men.
Then he gave the other papers <ERR type=[wd4,7-1]> to </ERR> two men.
Later Inspector White <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Sergeane </ERR> Bull and Miss Green <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beleived </ERR> the papers had <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Been </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rodded </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,15-1]> by </ERR> two men, they worried about that.
So Hunter <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> Professor </ERR> told them, the papers of this invention were in his hand.
He already <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> have </ERR> understood what's <ERR type=[vp6,7-0]> happen </ERR> .
The wind blows <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heavly </ERR> .
It <ERR type=[cc3,1-3]> doesn't </ERR> a good thing.
Today I learned the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nineth </ERR> Lesson --- sports and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> games </ERR> .
We can think how necessary sports and <ERR type=[wd4,7-0]> games </ERR> .
We must do more sports, then build our bodies, that we would work harder, love of <ERR type=[pr4,-]> our's </ERR> county to try our best to make it beautiful and strong .
<ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> In </ERR> this week, many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pople </ERR> doesn't be happy.
Because the Chinese football <ERR type=[fm1,-]> term </ERR> wasn't <ERR type=[vp1,8-0]> won </ERR> in the football match.
Everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-0]> hope </ERR> <ERR type=[np4,4-6]> China </ERR> football <ERR type=[wd3,8-6]> term </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,9-3]> win </ERR> in each match.
But things <ERR type=[vp3,4]> doesn't </ERR> decide for people want .
Our football <ERR type=[wd3,2-0]> term </ERR> is weak.
I think I can't throw much more <ERR type=[cc3,7-3]> wish </ERR> in football <ERR type=[wd3,2-0]> term </ERR> .
In my studies, there are eight <ERR type=[fm1,-]> subjues </ERR> which have to <ERR type=[vp7,7-0]> learn </ERR> .
There are <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> China </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd3,5-0]> Match </ERR> , English, physics, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chemise </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Histray </ERR> ....
Our teacher who <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> teach </ERR> us history s a <ERR type=[np3,10-2]> men </ERR> of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> porties </ERR> .
He <ERR type=[vp3,1-0]> talk </ERR> very well.
His <ERR type=[fm1,-]> knowleage </ERR> is like a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ea </ERR> .
He taught us <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> nearly </ERR> one ear.
I have learned <ERR type=[cc4,3-1]> many </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,4-0]> knowlege </ERR> about China or <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> world </ERR> .I depended on myself to learn <ERR type=[wd4,7-0]> history </ERR> ago and I didn't <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> hear </ERR> teacher's lesson.
But now I pay <ERR type=[fm1,-]> attionsion </ERR> to teacher's lesson.
I would <ERR type=[vp2,2-5]> put </ERR> my heart into the lesson.
If you visit our school, the No.4 Middle school you must feel very <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> surprise </ERR> .
Many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> builting </ERR> have been knocked down.
The workers are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bjuilting </ERR> .
They give a great deal of good <ERR type=[np3,7-0]> idea </ERR> , in order to make the school more beautiful.
The work of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rebuilting </ERR> the school is all the students and teachers' wish.
We hope all of us could live in a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> quite </ERR> , beautiful, great space to learn knowledge.
I think when the school <ERR type=[fm1,-]> finishs </ERR> rebuiding.
I have <ERR type=[vp6,11-1]> eft </ERR> here.
That day sn't very <ERR type=[wd3,4-0]> long </ERR> .
Many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> homeword </ERR> would be done.
I borrowed a lot of books <ERR type=[wd3,6-1]> for </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> laberition </ERR> .
Through the playing, I made quite a few <ERR type=[wd5,5-2]> and </ERR> new friends.
Only in the playing lace, I eel happy <ERR type=[wd5,8-0]> yet </ERR> .
Before we <ERR type=[wd3,2-4][vp6,2-0]> can't </ERR> be allowed to play football or basketball in school, somebody said that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Hay </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sth </ERR> in school will harm <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sb </ERR> or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sth </ERR> .
In the winter holiday I <ERR type=[vp6,5-3]> do </ERR> all the housework, because my mother and father had to go to work, <ERR type=[wd5,21-3]> so </ERR> I <ERR type=[vp6,14-1]> do </ERR> everything.
I <ERR type=[vp6,36-2]> feel </ERR> very tired.
I <ERR type=[vp6,42-5]> try </ERR> my best to do that.
In the two weeks, I <ERR type=[vp6,5-0]> think </ERR> a lot of <ERR type=[np3,3-0]> thing </ERR> , which I <ERR type=[vp6,16-2]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,6-0]> to </ERR> with.
Everyone <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> feel </ERR> happy with it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> because </ERR> of the reason, this spring holiday is very pleasant.
I have eaten a lot of food <ERR type=[wd3,7-2]> on </ERR> several days.
Eating too much will make <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sb </ERR> become fat.
I am afraid I would <ERR type=[vp2,2-3]> turn </ERR> a fat boy.
But the food <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> are </ERR> very good.
In this year, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goverment </ERR> in guang <ERR type=[fm3,-][fm3,-]> zhou </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,14-7]> don't </ERR> allow the people to play a game.
The game is playing <ERR type=[vp2,4-0]> fire </ERR> .I think it was <ERR type=[np7,4-2]> a </ERR> interesting game.
The children play them with <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pleasnet </ERR> .
But the game is a little <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dange </ERR> .This <ERR type=[np1,1-8]> year </ERR> of the Spring holiday is like last year's, there are no new things.
All the people go there and go here all the day except the people whose leg can't <ERR type=[cc2,3-0]> walk </ERR> .
I didn't buy <ERR type=[pr6,-]> some </ERR> new clothes or shoes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> this </ERR> year is cow .
I feel <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unluck </ERR> now.
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> famil </ERR> will move in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Match </ERR> .
Now my home which I <ERR type=[vp2,5-2]> live </ERR> is big, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> through </ERR> it isn't great, it is big.
I have a room <ERR type=[wd4,5-0]> for </ERR> own.
I am afraid the place where we <ERR type=[vp2,7-9]> move </ERR> is very far from my No.
Oh, if the place is <ERR type=[aj3,3-2]> farer </ERR> than there.
The weather turns colder and colder, the wind blows <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heavly </ERR> .
They stay in bed and feel warmer than <ERR type=[fm1,-]> our </ERR> of bed.
I learned the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Nineth </ERR> Lesson--sports and game.
It says sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work with their brains most of the day, and then sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy, they are also very useful for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> charcter </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tranining </ERR> .
We can think how necessary sports and <ERR type=[wd4,7-0]> games </ERR> .
Our <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> greatest Leader, comrade Dun Xi Ping is dead.
He left <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> among </ERR> us for ever.
Every <ERR type=[fm1,-]> one </ERR> can't help <ERR type=[cc3,6-1]> holding </ERR> tears, for the great man's death.
His name, which nobody <ERR type=[vp3,4-1]> don't </ERR> know will stay <ERR type=[pp1,10-2]> at </ERR> our heart, comrade Don Xi Ping have put his life the throw into revolutionary affairs since he joined the Chinese Party.
Comrade Don Xi Ping hoped that he could see Hong <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Gong </ERR> would return to our country <ERR type=[wd5,5-2]> till </ERR> one day.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> he couldn't see with his own eyes.
I think he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> regreted </ERR> very much.
It was he who <ERR type=[vp6,11-7]> leads </ERR> us to go to the new tomorrow.
We will miss the great <ERR type=[np3,5-8]> men </ERR> for ever.

<ERR type=[vp6,0-16]> It's </ERR> the day when the emperor wore his new clothes to take part in the great procession.
Only a child <ERR type=[wd3,3-8]> said </ERR> the truth --- the emperor had nothing on.
<ERR type=[pp1,0-1]> At </ERR> then, the emperor knew that the people were right.
Books are our friends because they are <ERR type=[np1,7-2]> bridges </ERR> to knowledge.
Because books give them knowledge, and knowledge <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> give </ERR> them power.
If a man didn't read <ERR type=[wd5,5-1]> the </ERR> books, he is half blind.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> sometimes </ERR> you should take some notes whenever you feel it necessary.
Books make us to learn about the past and look forward to the future and <ERR type=[cc3,15-4]> learn </ERR> a lot of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> konowledge </ERR> .
Perhaps <ERR type=[fm1,-]> somebady </ERR> could ask: " why?

My first teacher <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> name </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,-2]> Mr </ERR> Cheng, she was a middle- aged woman.
She <ERR type=[vp6,15-11]> works </ERR> very hard and <ERR type=[vp6,21-7]> has </ERR> been a model teacher for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> serves </ERR> times.
<ERR type=[np3,-]> Mr. </ERR> Cheng was kind to us, but she was strict with us.
<ERR type=[np3,-]> Mr. </ERR> Cheng loves us and is ready to help us.
My good friend <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> named </ERR> Fei Fei.
She <ERR type=[vp6,1-13]> is </ERR> my classmate of the middle school period.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> During </ERR> the middle school, we often <ERR type=[vp6,8-2]> do </ERR> our homework and <ERR type=[vp6,14-3]> play </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,17-2]> the </ERR> game together.
<ERR type=[pp1,0-5]> On </ERR> study, we help each other.
This kind of helping is always encouraged <ERR type=[wd3,7-2]> for </ERR> each other.
Fei Fei has a great wish: she <ERR type=[vp3,1-10]> have </ERR> decided to become a middle school teacher in the future.
This news was <ERR type=[aj4,3-2]> surprised </ERR> to me.
She <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> love </ERR> children.
Though <ERR type=[np4,1-4]> teachers </ERR> work is too hard, it <ERR type=[vp6,9-4]> was </ERR> very interesting to her because <ERR type=[pr1,17-4]> it </ERR> can help the children.
She <ERR type=[vp3,1-12]> don't </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,4-7]> think </ERR> to deal with them all years round is just wasting time .
On the contrary, to her it would very.. though Fei Fei and I aren't studying in the same middle school, we <ERR type=[vp6,15-4][vp3,15-2]> was </ERR> very <ERR type=[aj1,21-0]> friendly </ERR> .
We are good <ERR type=[np6,3-2]> friend </ERR> for ever.
A day <ERR type=[pp1,7-3]> at </ERR> the summer holiday.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-4]> Sometime </ERR> I did my homework, <ERR type=[wd3,0-5]> sometime </ERR> I watched TV, <ERR type=[wd3,0-6]> sometime </ERR> I played table tennis with <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> friend </ERR> .
Usually I get up at seven thirty in the morning and then go out to swim, but I would do morning exercise or run a few <ERR type=[np3,3-2]> second </ERR> before swimming.
About at nine, <ERR type=[pr1,3-4]> this </ERR> is my breakfast's time.
I watch TV <ERR type=[ad1,3-7]> about </ERR> from five to ten to twelve thirty.
During the time, <ERR type=[ad1,3-5]> about </ERR> at twelve I have lunch.
The time of <ERR type=[np1,3-8]> afternoon </ERR> , I do my homework carefully for three hours.
After supper, I read newspapers or listen to the radio <ERR type=[wd3,8-0]> sometime </ERR> .
I like this <ERR type=[np3,3-6]> days </ERR> because I have a good time.
It is also one of the working languages at international <ERR type=[np6,7-0]> meeting </ERR> .
If <ERR type=[fm1,-]> your </ERR> English study well, you can serve our country better.
I <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> has </ERR> been very like it .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> I study very ....
In <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> my </ERR> Grade Five, I met with some difficulties of studying.
For example, don't remember the new words, the sounds <ERR type=[vp3,-]> isn't </ERR> correct.
After I study English for a long time, I <ERR type=[vp6,9-12]> master </ERR> the ways of studying, so I have made a lot of progress.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> everything </ERR> is hard in the beginning".
I have ever heard <ERR type=[pr3,12-1]> this </ERR> word.
<ERR type=[pp1,0-4]> In </ERR> the day of future, I will study harder to make greater progress.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Rainny </ERR>
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-5]> is </ERR> three weeks since term began.
We came <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> back </ERR> our school to <ERR type=[cc3,8-3]> study </ERR> new knowledge again.
So we have a study at school at <ERR type=[np1,1-4]> night </ERR> of Monday to Friday and Saturday.
Because this can be study more carefully than past by us and prevent us from watching TV at home at night .I decided to spend these <ERR type=[np3,5-12]> time </ERR> to study harder and do my best to get the good mark.
Friday of last week <ERR type=[vp6,4-3]> is </ERR> Mid- Autumn Day.
I ate the moon cake and <ERR type=[vp1,6-7][vp6,6-5]> go </ERR> in front of the window, I saw the moon is very bright.
I <ERR type=[vp1,1-4]> felt </ERR> the moon extra right.
At that time, here and there <ERR type=[vp6,6-4][vp1,6-2]> are </ERR> very silent.
Because people <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> is </ERR> seeing the moon now.
This evening I was happy, <ERR type=[vp4,5-2]> wish </ERR> you too.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-9]> is </ERR> three weeks since the student of the teacher's college.
When they <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> came </ERR> our school, I thought can they teach us well .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> I thought so, I have lesson listened carefully, too .
<ERR type=[pp1,0-8][fm3,-]> during </ERR> they gave a lesson for us, many teachers sat in the classroom <ERR type=[wd5,8-2]> and </ERR> behind me.
So we had lessons <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> silent </ERR> .
I felt they <ERR type=[wd3,3-6][vp6,3-4]> talk </ERR> better than I supposed.
In the three weeks, I wish we <ERR type=[vp1,3-5]> will </ERR> get on well with them.
I remember <ERR type=[pp1,2-4]> before </ERR> the sports <ERR type=[wd2,-]> meeting </ERR> began.
Every morning, some students in our school came to school very early, and <ERR type=[vp6,13-3]> do </ERR> the match exercise on the playground because the time of the match was more and more <ERR type=[aj3,10-0]> fast </ERR> and they hoped that they got the good mark in it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> during </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spots </ERR> meet, the student <ERR type=[pp1,2-6]> of </ERR> having the match are very <ERR type=[aj3,10-0][wd3,s-]> harder </ERR> , <ERR type=[vp4,13-7]> try </ERR> them best to get the good mark.
So today my mother and I went shopping together <ERR type=[pp1,9-2]> in </ERR> this morning.
We went into a shop, I found there <ERR type=[vp6,3-0]> are </ERR> a lot of <ERR type=[wd5,9-3]> the </ERR> suit in it and these <ERR type=[vp6,17-2]> are </ERR> very beautiful.
At this time, shop <ERR type=[np6,4-3]> assistant </ERR> came towards me and said " what can I do for you, young <ERR type=[np1,19-0]> people </ERR> ?
" I said: " I'm looking for the suit for young people, can I <ERR type=[vp9,2-1]> look </ERR> them at first?
" " <ERR type=[fm3,-]> sure </ERR> " she answered.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> the skirt became my birthday present.
My mother not only bought the skirt to me, but also <ERR type=[vp6,11-8]> encourage </ERR> me to try my best to study hard.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> We </ERR> saw many kinds of goods in it and <ERR type=[pr4,9-3]> them </ERR> are very beautiful.
Many shops are <ERR type=[vp6,3-4]> serve </ERR> for the young people.
My birthday will come, so my friend <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bough </ERR> a present to <ERR type=[vp1,9-1]> send </ERR> me.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-7]> was </ERR> nine weeks since we went to school.
This week we <ERR type=[vp3,3-5]> has </ERR> begun to go over lessons.
The next day, I would ask my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> techer </ERR> or my classmates.I felt it <ERR type=[vp6,3-4]> help </ERR> me to study well.
Saturday Nov. 23 1996 <ERR type=[fm3,-]> sunny </ERR>
Because skating is usually young people's <ERR type=[np3,6-0]> sports </ERR> , and many young people are also <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> like </ERR> it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> one </ERR> of he reasons I like it is skating is very interesting, and when I skated around <ERR type=[wd3,4-1]> others </ERR> people, I felt very happy.
At the same time, I felt very....Skating not only <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> build </ERR> our bodies, <ERR type=[vp3,8-5]> prevent </ERR> us from getting too fat , but also <ERR type=[vp3,18-2]> keep </ERR> us healthy and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> what's </ERR> more, I studied hard so that I am very tired, after studying, if you go to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> skait </ERR> , you will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> filt </ERR> ..... that is all why I like skating.
Last Saturday, our grade <ERR type=[vp2,4-2]> went </ERR> to trip.
Because I <ERR type=[vp6,2-14]> need </ERR> to go to see the doctor.
I couldn't <ERR type=[vp2,2-5]> go </ERR> to trip with my classmates.
I feel ....And that day, after seeing the doctor, <ERR type=[wd5,-]> then </ERR> I Return home.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I went to school the day after tomorrow, I heard about the interesting thing of the trip.
I <ERR type=[vp6,1-12]> feel </ERR> my classmates had a good time, but only I heard their saying.
I thought : if I also <ERR type=[vp2,5-3]> went </ERR> to the trip, I was sure I would enjoy myself.
And the government sent two <ERR type=[np3,5-4]> man </ERR> to take his invention.
But at half past ten, two <ERR type=[np3,1-0]> man </ERR> came for the paper.
Professor knew that they were impostors through <ERR type=[vp1,7-1]> talking </ERR> about.
So <ERR type=[np6,1-6]> professor </ERR> only gave them some other papers, and they took a quick look and <ERR type=[vp6,7-1]> accept </ERR> them.
Shortly after that, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> polic </ERR> telephoned and told that the two <ERR type=[wd3,10-4]> government </ERR> aren't the right <ERR type=[np3,16-0]> man </ERR> .After the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> policman </ERR> heard from the professor, they also went out.
This week, we <ERR type=[wd2,-]> student </ERR> Lesson Eight.
After we practised in our seat, Miss Liu asked four students <ERR type=[vp4,11-5]> went </ERR> to the .. to act out.
Their <ERR type=[wd3,1-7]> characters </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,5-5]> are </ERR> professor, Miss Green Mary <ERR type=[wd4,-]> and </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> narratre </ERR> .
When they <ERR type=[vp4,2-15]> acting </ERR> out the scene 1, they not only <ERR type=[vp6,3-7]> red </ERR> the text, but also <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> did </ERR> the action.
In fact, this exercise was <ERR type=[wd2,-]> text </ERR> us the ... of speaking.
After that, we should <ERR type=[cc3,4-2]> do </ERR> more speaking.
This Sunday, I went to the book store because I <ERR type=[vp6,8-4]> want </ERR> to buy some pictures to finish my homework.
When I <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> come </ERR> into the book store, I saw there were many young people in it.
At last, I went <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> out </ERR> the book store.
I believed I <ERR type=[vp6,3-9]> can </ERR> find the picture and finish my homework before Wednesday.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-7]> is </ERR> three days since the winter holiday began.
This winter Holiday, I prepare to study at home <ERR type=[wd3,9-6]> besides </ERR> three days of the Spring Festival.
Every <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> day </ERR> morning I get up at seven thirty, and then go out to run a few seconds.
<ERR type=[ad1,0-2]> About </ERR> at nine, <ERR type=[pr1,5-4]> this </ERR> is my breakfast's time.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Frome </ERR> one to two, I will have a rest.
Then I <ERR type=[vp6,2-11]> continued </ERR> my homework carefully for a little time.
When supper is over, I read newspapers <ERR type=[vp4,3-10]> know </ERR> about some event of the country, and <ERR type=[vp4,13-2]> improve </ERR> my knowledge.
When I <ERR type=[vp2,2-1]> think </ERR> this, I feel very happy.
Though a few days in the future are the Spring Festival, I have important <ERR type=[np6,14-0]> task </ERR> .
That is <ERR type=[cc3,2-6]> catch </ERR> the time to finish my <ERR type=[np5,1-0]> homeworks </ERR> .
But this Spring Festival, my family bought a lot of flowers for example: <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chrysanthemun </ERR> ,... <ERR type=[fm1,-]> narcissue </ERR> .These are very beautiful.
This Spring Festival, on my way home to my uncle, somebody <ERR type=[vp6,11-6]> pat </ERR> me on he shoulder <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frome </ERR> behind.
I <ERR type=[vp6,1-6]> look </ERR> back.
Jun Ying <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> is </ERR> my classmate five years ago, and we are good friends now, she was studying in another middle school.
We are <ERR type=[vp4,2-5]> talk </ERR> a lot <ERR type=[wd5,7-2]> of </ERR> between us, and she <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heartity </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,5-7]> congratulate </ERR> me have more <ERR type=[wd2,10-3]> successive </ERR> in my study, I say to her: " the same to you, too.
When I <ERR type=[vp6,s]> get </ERR> to the classroom, many classmates <ERR type=[vp6,s]> have </ERR> already taken their <ERR type=[np3,12-0]> place </ERR> .
Among the classmates haven't meet a long time , so we <ERR type=[vp6,s]> talk </ERR> more as soon as we meet.
But when the bell <ERR type=[vp6,s]> ring </ERR> .
During the course of having lessons, we all <ERR type=[vp6,s]> listen </ERR> carefully.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> today is the first day to go to school this year.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s]> feel </ERR> very joyful and relaxing.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-8]> is </ERR> two <ERR type=[np3,1-6]> week </ERR> since the new school term began.
Because we will have graduation exam of five <ERR type=[np3,8-3]> subjects </ERR> in this term.
I believe that every <ERR type=[np3,4-0]> classmates </ERR> all ... a new plan of study.
So our task of study <ERR type=[vp3,5-1]> are </ERR> very ... during these days, many classmates give up doing others things.
<ERR type=[pp2,0-1]> At </ERR> class, we listen carefully.
after class, we <ERR type=[vp1,1-2]> go </ERR> over carefully.
[fm3,-] The new school term is a new beginning.
<ERR type=[pp1,0-3]> During </ERR> they <ERR type=[fm2,-]> teached </ERR> , we listened carefully and attentively.
To my surprise, the new teacher not only <ERR type=[fm2,-]> teached </ERR> but also was active in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> answing </ERR> our difficult question.
I hoped that they could <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succee </ERR> in teaching by his <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> hard </ERR> .
As I will have a maths text next Monday, I <ERR type=[vp1,10-10][vp6,10-8]> needed </ERR> to over the text besides finishing my homework.
Though <ERR type=[pp1,1-]> so </ERR> , I felt have a ... day.
So I must return these books <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> on </ERR> this Saturday, or I <ERR type=[vp6,13-5]> didn't </ERR> return the books on time.
I <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> saw </ERR> her carefully, and recognized her that she was my good friends in Junior middle school.
We <ERR type=[vp1,1-9]> spoke </ERR> our study situation and the <ERR type=[np1,9-3]> lives </ERR> situation each other.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> it rained hard suddenly at hat time, our running had a half , so that we returned to school.Though the running didn't <ERR type=[vp1,4-2]> realize </ERR> this time, I felt it had important <ERR type=[wd2,5-2]> instructive </ERR> to us.
But during this sport, I had a <ERR type=[wd2,3-0]> mistaken </ERR> .
Before I came to the team, as the water on the ground in front of me held me back.I didn't cross this road, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> while </ERR> I walked across another road.
So I was scolded by the head of the <ERR type=[cc1,9-0]> teacher </ERR> .
Many months ago, some parts of our school <ERR type=[vp7,8-1]> put </ERR> up.
Recently, these places <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> has </ERR> almost <ERR type=[vp1,5-0]> finished </ERR> .
Because our school's playground had <ERR type=[vp2,5-3]> taken </ERR> a new look.
It's certain that the classmates <ERR type=[vp1,5-0]> liked </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> after the new playground completely finished.
Next week, the senior three's classmates will have <ERR type=[np6,8-0]> exam </ERR> .
<ERR type=[cj1,0-1]> Though </ERR> so, we should stay at home to go over the lessons more carefully.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> I decide that I will not watch TV, because now our study is very important.
We should spend more <ERR type=[np5,4-3]> times </ERR> in studying lessons.
We <ERR type=[vp2,1-7]> act </ERR> in actually to welcome the graduation exams.
We had lessons in chemistry lab this week, when we <ERR type=[cc3,2-1]> came </ERR> there, the first day, we hadn't a little habit .
lessons outside, they made a lot of <ERR type=[fm1,-][np5,7-0]> noice </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp1,11-4]> affected </ERR> us to head lessons.
We should <ERR type=[vp1,2-3]> listen </ERR> lessons more carefully, but some classmates stood at last, sometimes they looked at the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> blackbroad </ERR> didn't clean.
We ended our classes <ERR type=[wd4,5-1]> in </ERR> chemistry lab.
So From May 1st to May <ERR type=[fm2,-]> 3nd </ERR> were our holidays.
But the graduation exams <ERR type=[vp3,4-4]> has </ERR> been nearer and nearer.
We <ERR type=[vp1,1-7]> didn't </ERR> much time to have a good time.
In these several days, I went to the library one day, the <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> others </ERR> days I stayed at home to go over lessons.
After some <ERR type=[np5,2-5]> times </ERR> you should have a rest, or you went over too much in a short time.
You would be <ERR type=[aj1,3-3]> difficult </ERR> to remember it.
I <ERR type=[vp1,1-4]> felt </ERR> very instructive these days.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> because </ERR> they <ERR type=[vp2,2-4]> dealt </ERR> the time was different, some people <ERR type=[vp2,2-3]> made </ERR> full use time to <ERR type=[vp1,1-2]> study </ERR> on work, and someone spent the time in chatting, gambling or playing.
When you did so, you will <ERR type=[vp1,6-5]> fell </ERR> your life is very valuable.
It has two studying building, and <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> a </ERR> experiment building.
They are <ERR type=[aj2,-3]> strict </ERR> to the students, and are all kind and helpful.
So he had to walk a long <ERR type=[np3,1-]> roads </ERR> to borrow books from a rich man.
I think <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Jun </ERR> is one of the best seasons in a year.It is time to have a composition class.
After the bell rang, the students took their <ERR type=[np3,4-0]> place </ERR> , waiting for the teacher.
At the time, some students began to <ERR type=[vp1,4-2]> talk </ERR> each other, some <ERR type=[wd5,10-5]> ones </ERR> read other books, others made noises.
Twenty seconds passed, the teacher entered the classroom, but she didn't make <ERR type=[np7,4-1]> a </ERR> apology.
She picked up a piece of chalk, writing on the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> blackbroad </ERR> "Teacher is late".
It was the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> First </ERR> week of this term.
And it <ERR type=[vp6,10-4]> is </ERR> a very important week.
It was our turn to be on duty <ERR type=[pp1,-3]> at </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> First </ERR> week.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Cleanning </ERR> the school is <ERR type=[np7,-3]> a </ERR> very hard work.
But some classmate <ERR type=[vp6,8-2]> have </ERR> some trouble <ERR type=[vp2,5-3]> on </ERR> doing his work, and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> havn't </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,11-2]> finished </ERR> his work.
The Relation Between A Boy And A Girl By the end of last week, at the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> political </ERR> class, our teacher gave us a talk.
She said that we mustn't be in love with any <ERR type=[pr6,7-]> others </ERR>
He <ERR type=[vp6,6-4]> was </ERR> very strict with us, and his knowledge is so rich that he often tell us many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> storied </ERR> about natural science, and he often <ERR type=[fm1,-]> toll </ERR> us many stories about natural science, and <ERR type=[np9,0-3]> some </ERR> his interesting records.
It <ERR type=[wd2,-]> wides </ERR> our horizon.
Cars of today are <ERR type=[vp2,4-0]> increase </ERR> very quickly.
Roads always <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> full </ERR> of cars such <ERR type=[pr1,8-2]> as </ERR> Thailand's Bangkok.
Old Guangzhou <ERR type=[vp2,2-2]> is </ERR> like that too.
Now the main Roads of new Guangzhou is <ERR type=[ad2,1-1]> enough </ERR> wide for the cars to run fast.
<ERR type=[pr2,0-4]> It </ERR> must thank the government for its working.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> STATVE </ERR> OF LIBERTY
It <ERR type=[vp2,6-2]> was </ERR> the present that the people of France sent to America in the nineteenth century.
It <ERR type=[vp2,24-3]> was </ERR> made of copper and it <ERR type=[vp2,32-3]> was </ERR> 150 feet tall.
Since it was set up, it <ERR type=[vp2,6-2]> became </ERR> a symbol of liberty for the people of America.
Today Is Too Bad Today <ERR type=[np1,1-0]> morning </ERR> , when it was blur, I went to visit a friend.
I found <ERR type=[pr2,2-3]> it </ERR> had turned black.
Oh, no, I <ERR type=[vp2,15-2]> have </ERR> no umbrella.
I thought it <ERR type=[vp2,2-4]> will </ERR> stop in two hours.
But it lasted <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> to </ERR> rained hard, and when I left, I had to borrow <ERR type=[np7,0-1]> a </ERR> umbrella and shippers, because the street was flooded.
Almost all <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aportment </ERR> <ERR type=[np1,3-0]> house </ERR> I GuangZhou have the <ERR type=[np6,13-0]> met </ERR> that <ERR type=[np6,6-2]> is </ERR> used to prevent the <ERR type=[np6,24-0]> thief </ERR> stealing.
The net painted into black or red s <ERR type=[vp7,8-2]> made </ERR> of iron.
This makes the house <ERR type=[vp4,3-1]> looks </ERR> like a cage and the people in it as <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> if </ERR> birds in the cage.
This <ERR type=[np4,1-3]> mirror's </ERR> the public order today is so bad and makes the city lifeless.
The visitors who come from foreign <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> country </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,8-3]> is </ERR> surprised at it.
This is a good <ERR type=[cc1,4-0]> matter </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,7-2]> to </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> develop </ERR> of the world's science <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ad </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,19-2]> to </ERR> the player of computer.
[fm2,-] Now the factory of CPU had three: Intel, Cyrix and AMD.
In some <ERR type=[fm2,-]> field, </ERR> Cyrix <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ar </ERR> AMD's technology of <ERR type=[np4,2-1]> CPU's </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,3-0]> produce </ERR> even over vp1,14-3] that of Intel.
Because the competition <ERR type=[wd3,-]> of </ERR> them is very keen, the price of the CPU falls down very quickly.
There <ERR type=[cc3,1-1]> were </ERR> holidays in this National Day.
Those <ERR type=[vp6,1-1]> should </ERR> be the universal rejoicing days.
But, when I came to know that there were three subjects would have a test as soon as the holidays went <ERR type=[cc2,1-1]> out. </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-][wd2,-]> Cromprehending </ERR>
This morning, from the magazine named Young Man And Young Girl , I found a statistics that in the middle school of Guangzhou, there are 85 the morning and <ERR type=[vp6,5-2]> raising </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> barbell, </ERR> and there are 42 schoolboys who have an athletic <ERR type=[cc1,2-0]> sports </ERR> at home or in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> studium </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> I </ERR> the holiday every week.
Reading this, I comprehended something and I felt quiet ashamed that I had had no physical training for more than one year outside the physical <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cuiture </ERR> class.
This was a bad <ERR type=[fm1,-]> habid, </ERR> and I wanted to correct <ERR type=[cc3,12-2]> it </ERR> from today.
So, I held my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> barbell </ERR> at once that had <ERR type=[vp6,10-3]> been </ERR> covered with dust and raised it....
The <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> Practice </ERR> Chinese Teacher
Three weeks ago, two practice Chinese teachers came to my class and began to <ERR type=[wd2,-]> teacher </ERR> .
At first, I wondered if they could teach us good as if the official Chinese teacher, for, being so young and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shout </ERR> of experience.
They were <ERR type=[fm1,-]> consicientious </ERR> in their <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> practice </ERR> work.
The most remarkable one of the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> woman </ERR> singers.
She just <ERR type=[vp6,2-19]> got </ERR> the prize <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> that </ERR> for the best woman singer who is recommended <ERR type=[fm1,-]> n </ERR> the area of Southeast Asia.
Her songs are <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> well-known </ERR> by their free form.
That is why I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> live </ERR> her songs.
However, every time, when I <ERR type=[vp6,4-8]> heard </ERR> her songs, I always <ERR type=[vp6,1-1]> felt </ERR> exciting.
Not long ago, she <ERR type=[cc3,0-3]> published </ERR> a new disc <ERR type=[vp4,-]> call </ERR> The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Seclect </ERR> Happy Music of Wang Fei .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> 16 songs, such as Dubiousness, DI-Dar.They are so good that <ERR type=[wd4,0-5]> even </ERR> you have heard 100 times you <ERR type=[vp9,9-2]> didn't </ERR> feel sick.
Although there are five motorcycle races in Asia except <ERR type=[pr2,7-0]> t </ERR> , it is the best and newest one.
So Zhuhai have enough conditions to be the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> central </ERR> of the motorcycle's athletics in Asia.
After all the <ERR type=[cc2,2-2]> engineering </ERR> is finished, it will be able to hold 12000 spectators.
I am so <ERR type=[aj4,3-0]> exciting </ERR> and I am <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> proud </ERR> for it.
After <ERR type=[wd3,1-0]> walking </ERR> round the Lake, we saw the performance of <ERR type=[wd3,0-4]> "going </ERR> on the steel wire".
his <ERR type=[vp6,12-3]> make </ERR> us <ERR type=[vp5,4-1]> felt </ERR> cheated.
[wd4,0-13] Last three hours, we walked and walked from place to place to take photos.
Although every landscape <ERR type=[vp6,11-2]> have </ERR> good names, but it always bring vp6,19-2] us disappointment.
A <ERR type=[cc1,0-2]> part </ERR> of people only <ERR type=[fm2,-]> layed </ERR> cards all through the three hours.
I think the most <ERR type=[wd7,2-1]> intent </ERR> thing I did is I left my foot mark on the hill.
But the <ERR type=[wd7,1-1]> unfeeling </ERR> fact would not make me downhearted.
I looked for the reason that I failed and I found the most important reason was that I had few <ERR type=[wd7,0-1]> pressing </ERR> feeling.
[fm1,-] It makes me think out <ERR type=[fm1,-]> al </ERR> kinds of ways to improve the study <ERR type=[wd3,1-0]> ways </ERR> and to <ERR type=[vp5,1-0]> arranged </ERR> the study time more <ERR type=[wd2,7-0]> reasonable </ERR> .
My motto of today is "All the work <ERR type=[np1,2-0]> today </ERR> is <ERR type=[vp6,7-2]> finished </ERR> within today".
It includes reviewing all the subject today and solving all the <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> question </ERR> about them.I expect the success.
He wanted to have <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> gone </ERR> to London to give the papers to the government.
But his daughter didn't <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> allow </ERR> him to go, because he was not strong enough to go.
They accepted it and soon <ERR type=[vp6,5-1]> go </ERR> away.
At last, Miss Green, Dr. Hunter's secretary, received the police's phone call about the <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> true </ERR> , and she told Dr Hunter sadly.
Then two policemen came to know about the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> impostor's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,3-0]> character </ERR> and Miss Green <ERR type=[vp6,s]> go </ERR> with the policemen to help them.
It's <ERR type=[np7,1-2]> the </ERR> great meeting which <ERR type=[vp6,9-1]> was </ERR> held each year.
Last year, our class had no programme which was <ERR type=[wd3,7-3]> showed </ERR> on the stage.
But , this year, almost everyone in the class was <ERR type=[wd3,-]> mobilized </ERR> to attend the meeting.
The programmes that we were practing such as comic <ERR type=[fm2,-]> dialogue, </ERR> fashion show, <ERR type=[vp4,0-2]> sing </ERR> in chorus and so on.
All the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> actores </ERR> were excited and they put their heart into the practise.
If you <ERR type=[vp6,2-0]> wanted </ERR> to see them <ERR type=[wd3,8-0]> impatiently </ERR> , you <ERR type=[vp6,12-14]> could </ERR> go to the top of the No.4 Middle School from Monday to Friday, you <ERR type=[vp6,30-3]> would </ERR> see them there.
The Fashion Show Of Our Class On TV, I had <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> seen </ERR> the fashion <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hoe </ERR> many times.
So , when I heard that our class <ERR type=[vp6,4-4]> will </ERR> have a fashion show in the Art Festival, I felt very interested.
Miss Lin was the person in <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> charge </ERR> it.
They practised almost every day and they <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> trained </ERR> hard.
Today, on the preview, some of them dressed ball shirts, some dressed blue jeans and checked shirts .... <ERR type=[pr5,0-3]> What </ERR> prestige they are!
They <ERR type=[ad1,-s]> all </ERR> were wonderful.
His <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> bearing </ERR> was smart and his <ERR type=[wd5,0-1]> singing </ERR> voice was so good that he got the first-grade prize.
Although <ERR type=[pr2,1-4]> it </ERR> was the lunch time, hearing his comic dialogue I felt not hungry but belly ache.
In a word, the Art <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Festivol </ERR> was successful.
If China Lost <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Lekai </ERR> In China, the films from the foreign <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> country </ERR> are sold much cheaper than <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> on </ERR> their native countries.
The film factory in China <ERR type=[vp7,3-1]> calls </ERR> Lekai.
<ERR type=[np8,0-2]> A </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Lekai </ERR> film is <ERR type=[vp1,3-4]> sold </ERR> only about ten yuan, This makes the foreign films have to be sold <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> in </ERR> a low price.
In other countries which have no film <ERR type=[fm2,-]> factory </ERR> of their own.Such as in Russia, <ERR type=[np7,0-1]> a </ERR> imported film is sold <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> in </ERR> about fifteen dollar.
Would the ported films be sold <ERR type=[ad1,2-4]> still </ERR> in a low price, if China lost <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Lekai </ERR> ?
Though we had <ERR type=[vp6,1-8]> known </ERR> that this Winter Holiday could be very short and we would have to make up lessons in it, I had hoped the teachers would give us few <ERR type=[np5,1-]> homeworks </ERR> , then, I could have a good rest to meet the new term.
Every teacher but Mr Zeng gave us a lot of <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> homeworks </ERR> .
Oh, my <ERR type=[fm3,-]> god, </ERR> there were only thirteen free days.
In these days, I could have to pay some New <ERR type=[np4,2-1]> Years </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> calls </ERR> to my relatives with my parents , have to finish the <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> exercised </ERR> .
What a <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Holiday </ERR> !
They wanted to <ERR type=[wd7,0-3]> devoloped </ERR> the Bull's vigour: dare not to do the tired things.
Proping <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> up </ERR> umbrellas, we alked about the busy Flower Fair and the beautiful flowers excited.
The bad weather didn't make us <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dissappointed </ERR> , instead we had a good time at that night.
To the children, the Spring Festival means they can wear <ERR type=[np7,10-2]> the </ERR> new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> clothers </ERR> , get the "Lishe".
It's time for them to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> havest </ERR> .
To the adult, the Spring Festival is the busy <ERR type=[np6,6-0]> day </ERR> .
To most people , they will play <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> deep </ERR> into the night, get up <ERR type=[aj3,2-3]> later </ERR> in next morning.
Maybe it knew that we would go to visit our old <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Classmaster </ERR> , it stopped raining at AM <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> 9:00 </ERR> At 10:00.All the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> friend </ERR> had <ERR type=[np1,6-3]> been </ERR> the assembly point, but one, At last, we knew from the phone call that he had forgotten it.
After we <ERR type=[vp6,16-3]> leave </ERR> the teacher's home at 12:30.
We quarrelled about the place where we <ERR type=[vp9,6-2]> would </ERR> have lunch.
At the fast food restaurant we would have <ERR type=[wd1,7-0]> lunch </ERR> .At the fast food restaurant, we threw the ice which in the soft drink to <ERR type=[pr3,10-1]> other </ERR> friends.
The new term <ERR type=[vp6,3-6]> had </ERR> been on Formally for two weeks.
All customs that in last term <ERR type=[vp6,20-2]> Had </ERR> been restored.
We <ERR type=[vp6,26-6]> had </ERR> to go to school at night again.
Besides this,, we <ERR type=[vp6,39-4]> had </ERR> to go to school at night again.
Besides this, we <ERR type=[vp6,52-15]> had </ERR> to go to school to read aloud the <ERR type=[wd1,3-0]> text </ERR> at AM 7 <ERR type=[wd1,2-0]> :30 </ERR> , and we <ERR type=[vp6,74-12]> had </ERR> to write the <ERR type=[cc4,0-1]> old </ERR> words from vp2,6-1] memory everyday.
Although we <ERR type=[vp6,91-5]> didn't </ERR> want to do those things, they <ERR type=[vp6,100-11]> were </ERR> the only way to <ERR type=[vp2,0-2]> get </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,0-1]> the </ERR> success in our learning.
Such as the new basket-ball ground will be finished <ERR type=[wd5,2-0]> building </ERR> soon.
We all <ERR type=[vp6,8-8]> were </ERR> busy doing the maths excises day and night.
At last, I found the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rror </ERR> is in the printing.
It <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> caped </ERR> the letter "I".
When I told <ERR type=[pr4,2-2]> his </ERR> this result, he opened his mouth, <ERR type=[vp4,4-2]> last </ERR> fifteen seconds.
I had <ERR type=[vp6,1-0]> believes </ERR> that it was a very hard question which few people could work out.
Otherwise, I would <ERR type=[vp6,19-3]> work </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,3-0]> it </ERR> like Cuozongci.
This Saturday, there came a bad news that we would had <ERR type=[vp4,2-2]> to </ERR> write composition.
But, besides his, I had to do the chemical exercises which had eleven pages, had to do the English exercises which <ERR type=[vp6,7-2]> has </ERR> twelve pages, had to go over the English lessons, had to go over the political lessons for he coming examination on next Tuesday.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> Since </ERR> this week, our new basket-ball <ERR type=[np6,12-0]> courts </ERR> had entered the last constructional stage.
<ERR type=[pr1,21-0]> They </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,0-5]> would </ERR> be finished in two weeks.
We <ERR type=[vp6,35-0]> could </ERR> free <ERR type=[fm2,-]> ourself </ERR> from the provisional basket-ball <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> courts </ERR> .
The old <ERR type=[np6,8-0]> courts </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,52-1]> were </ERR> covered with sands.
After it raided the old courts <ERR type=[vp6,62-5]> were </ERR> always <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> being </ERR> covered with water.
When the new basket-ball <ERR type=[np6,78-0]> courts </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,79-2]> were </ERR> set up, we would never feel helpless in face of a task beyond our capability.
We <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> were </ERR> expecting the day's coming.
Last year, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> They </ERR> published the first record of their own.
It was the hit <ERR type=[fm2,-]> single </ERR> Love <ERR type=[fm3,-]> me </ERR> for a <ERR type=[fm3,-]> reason </ERR> that made them famous.
Soon the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> single </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Words </ERR> in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,12-4]> climb </ERR> up the Pop Notice.
We are intoxicated with its <ERR type=[fm1,-]> melodions </ERR> singing.
Pride <ERR type=[vp3,-]> Make </ERR> Fall
In three tests which had been on in <ERR type=[np9,1-2]> this </ERR> two weeks, I lagged behind, because of pride.
It had <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> surrounded </ERR> me for one year.
After I <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> changed </ERR> it last term, I made a progress.
ut, In <ERR type=[np9,1-2]> this </ERR> two weeks, I <ERR type=[vp6,7-4]> follow </ERR> the same disastrous road.
Now, I must <ERR type=[vp4,1-2]> changed </ERR> it again.
I must pull my forces together and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tart </ERR> afresh.
The Worst Luck <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> In </ERR> this Wednesday, I met the worst luck.
From evening to evening, there were six or seven <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> rains </ERR> of sand blown into my left eye.
The biggest one must be the one that was blown into my left eye on the intersection of Taibao Street <ERR type=[fm1,-]> I </ERR> the evening.
Cursing the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> gob, </ERR> I <ERR type=[vp6,-3]> get </ERR> to my classroom.
I had a rest for fifteen minutes.After that, I washed <ERR type=[wd7,1-4]> out </ERR> at about eight o'clock.
It took me more than forty-five minutes to with <ERR type=[vp2,9-0]> it </ERR> !
Hong Kong <ERR type=[vp6,-]> Be </ERR> Better, Tomorrow
Today, the Qingma Bridge in HK <ERR type=[vp6,5-3]> was </ERR> brought to completion.
It has two <ERR type=[wd7,3-13]> strata </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Cars </ERR> run on the upper <ERR type=[wd3,13-0]> stratum </ERR> and trains run on the other one.In the evening, there held a large celebration for <ERR type=[pr1,9-0]> that </ERR> , including the play of the fireworks.
I believe this will be <ERR type=[cc2,2-0]> reality </ERR> .
Who <ERR type=[vp4,1-1]> Control </ERR> Whom?
The competition between the computer <ERR type=[np3,4-0]> company </ERR> became keener.
This made the price <ERR type=[fm1,-]> if </ERR> the computer lower and lower.
<ERR type=[wd5,0-3]> And </ERR> more and more new products appear .
In this <ERR type=[wd3,2-0]> side </ERR> man controlled the computer.
This made the people who were using "486" or "386" have to change their computer into "586", or they would not use the new <ERR type=[np5,-]> softwares </ERR> well.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> In </ERR> this side, computer <ERR type=[vp6,0-5]> controlled </ERR> man.
No matter who controls whom, this relation will make the society develop even faster, and it has <ERR type=[pr1,2-0]> done </ERR> .
The Trouble By The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Termites </ERR>
The last self-study hours in the evening this Wednesday , wrote down the <ERR type=[aj3,1-1]> awkwardest </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,6-6]> position </ERR> in the history of my class.
Because they always <ERR type=[wd2,2-3]> against </ERR> to our body, we used all kinds of ways to drive <ERR type=[wd3,-]> off </ERR> or kill them.
Some struck them by <ERR type=[np6,-]> hand </ERR> , some by <ERR type=[wd3,-]> book </ERR> , even some by rule.
<ERR type=[ad1,0-4]> Even </ERR> there was a classmate who put the termites into a bottle.
At last, we thought of the best way <ERR type=[vp4,3-1]> killed </ERR> termites.
We put two <ERR type=[wd7,3-0]> buckets </ERR> .
With more and more termites were <ERR type=[vp4,6-7]> killed </ERR> by this way, the class became quiet.
It has been <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> built </ERR> for seventy years As a key school, many of the students who had graduated <ERR type=[vp6,29-2]> had </ERR> been famous.
On the play-ground, the students can do all sorts of <ERR type=[cc3,4-0]> activities </ERR> to have physical training.
As we all knew, the great flood <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> had </ERR> broken out in Conghua and Huadu.
But, out of my estimation, the victims of the natural disaster <ERR type=[vp6,23-6]> didn't </ERR> show too much lament.
Their <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> calm </ERR> shook me very much.
As soon as the water turned back, they took an active part in rebuilding their <ERR type=[np6,8-0]> house </ERR> .
From them, I saw the <ERR type=[wd2,3-0]> strongwilled </ERR> ; I saw the active life.
In the disaster area, there is a lot of rice field which <ERR type=[vp6,12-1]> wasn't </ERR> submerged by the flood.
It means they will have <ERR type=[np7,5-2]> the </ERR> good harvest.
About ten years <ERR type=[fm1,-]> go, </ERR> when I was spending my holiday in Beijing, I swam for the last time.

Then I began to write, and has <ERR type=[fm2,-]> writed </ERR> it for half <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> and </ERR> hour.
On Thursday we had <ERR type=[np7,0-1]> a </ERR> 800 metres run exercise, though it was not a test, we must run five <ERR type=[wd3,2-0]> rings </ERR> around the football stadium.
I ran with the girls of our class, when I ran <ERR type=[fm1,-]> arround </ERR> the second <ERR type=[wd3,7-0]> ring </ERR> , I begun to feel tied, but there was three left, I did not give up, when I ran <ERR type=[fm1,-]> arround </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-1]> forth </ERR> ring, I felt very tied, and my leg was very heavy, then I said to myself , there's only one left, I must insist, must go to the end, I <ERR type=[vp6,16-0]> encourage </ERR> myself to the end.

Though they <ERR type=[vp6,14-1]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,0-1]> incompleted </ERR> of their <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> body </ERR> , they still <ERR type=[vp6,27-1]> work </ERR> hard and study hard.
In fact they really <ERR type=[vp6,44-3]> make </ERR> out some <ERR type=[np6,1-]> achievement </ERR> .
Perfect as <ERR type=[pr4,2-0]> us </ERR> , happy as <ERR type=[pr4,2-7]> us </ERR> ought to study more <ERR type=[ad3,2-2]> hard </ERR> than them.
Now there <ERR type=[np3,1-3]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> thirty </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Six </ERR> classes, one thousand eight hundred students and more than two hundred <ERR type=[np3,2-0]> teacher </ERR> in the school.

She was <ERR type=[wd3,8-0]> dangerous </ERR> .
Wu Dong <ERR type=[vp6,6-3]> jump </ERR> into the river without taking off the clothes.
He swam closer to the girl and caught hold of her <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> arm </ERR> and <ERR type=[pr4,-2]> them </ERR> swam back.
After a while, they <ERR type=[vp6,27-2]> reach </ERR> the bank.
The girl's father <ERR type=[vp6,5-1]> thanks </ERR> Wu Dong very much he wanted to give him some money.
But Wu Dong <ERR type=[vp6,24-0]> refuse </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,3-0]> it </ERR> and said: "This what I should.

It's really a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> got </ERR> day.
It's about 30 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> drgree </ERR> centigrade.

After sometime <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> had </ERR> passed, the Emperor sent his old prime minister and <ERR type=[np7,0-1]> a </ERR> official to see the cloth.
Now at last the Emperor <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> wished </ERR> to go himself and see the cloth while it was still on the looms, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> But </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,22-0]> they </ERR> couldn't see the cloth and the Emperor cried out loud.

When I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> studed </ERR> in the Liuhua Middel School, I got many good <ERR type=[wd3,14-0]> results </ERR> .
In the Class, I <ERR type=[vp6,4-22]> was </ERR> the best student, but since I studied in this school, my results were not as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> god </ERR> as before.

One day, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Willian </ERR> Tell went to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Alovy </ERR> with his little son.
Later, Gessler <ERR type=[wd2,1-5]> angried </ERR> what William Tell had said .... Then he thought <ERR type=[fm1,-]> our </ERR> a cruel plan to punish William Tell.
He made the boy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tae </ERR> one hundred paces down the street and place an apple on his head, Then he ordered Tell to shoot at the apple with one of his arrows William's son was brave to do that.
After a while, William raised the bow, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paled </ERR> back the cord and after <ERR type=[vp4,11-2]> taking </ERR> careful aim, let the arrow fly.
The apple was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spit </ERR> in half by the arrow.
The story of the <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> braveing </ERR> of William Tell and <ERR type=[np7,-]> has </ERR> son quickly got round throughout Switzerland.
It filled the hearts of the Swiss with pride and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cowage </ERR> and it was not long before the whole country rose up and drove the Austrian soldiers from <ERR type=[pr3,10-1]> her </ERR> homeland.

The <ERR type=[fm2,-]> five </ERR> week
A question of <ERR type=[sn9,-> reading </ERR>
When I was a child, I had many good friends in my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contry </ERR> side.
I was lucky to make some new friends <ERR type=[wd3,14-]> here </ERR> .
Those days <ERR type=[wd4,3-5]> were </ERR> most happy of my life, because there <ERR type=[vp6,11-5]> are </ERR> many good friends around me.
Now, I hope very much that I can see them again.I still remember <ERR type=[wd3,4-7]> that </ERR> day <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> which </ERR> I first came to school.
[fm3,-] , they told me, "Welcome to our class, you have <ERR type=[vp6,2-]> been </ERR> a pupil of our class.
" After I <ERR type=[wd3,4-5]> listened </ERR> to this, I was so <ERR type=[vp5,9-]> exciting </ERR> , but I only laughed and said," Thank you!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> three </ERR> years later, I left my school, I began to study in a famous Middle School in Xinxiang.
I made many new friends but I also <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> missed </ERR> many friends.
From making friends, I really know what the <ERR type=[fm1,3-1]> lift </ERR> is.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> from </ERR> now on, I will try my best to make more friends, to make better friends.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> that case our life will <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> change </ERR> more and ore happy , we <ERR type=[ad1,2-6]> also </ERR> will <ERR type=[wd3,4-4]> change </ERR> more and more friendly.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> STORYS </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> now </ERR> , I'm fifteen years old.
I have a lot of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> storys </ERR> want to tell every <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bady </ERR> , but I know it is onlya dream.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frist </ERR> story.
She did lots of things for me, and so did I. <ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> did many things together, such as swimming, study, even <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> succeed </ERR> or <ERR type=[fm1,2-]> fall </ERR> and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> that </ERR> time we used to be happy, but then everything was <ERR type=[vp7,3-]> changed </ERR> .
She had a strange illness, <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> and </ERR> the same time, I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> studiing </ERR> computer.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> after </ERR> many years, now I think I lost her, but she <ERR type=[vp9,2-2]> don't </ERR> lose me.
Because those years I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> her all the time, because she is my best friend, because I love her .
Our story is <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> endding </ERR> .
This story <ERR type=[np7,s-]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frist </ERR> and also <ERR type=[np7,s-]> is </ERR> last.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> since </ERR> a long time ago, I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> love </ERR> a song called " <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Storys </ERR> ".
Until now, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> clear the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frist </ERR> and the last sentences of the song: " I'm standing here alone, it doesn't so clear to me " and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> You </ERR> say our story is ending!
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> was very poor.
so <ERR type=[pr1,s-s]> she </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-s][vp1,2-3]> decide </ERR> changed the condition <ERR type=[fm3,-]> .one </ERR> day , Mr Li went out to look for some grass for his cows.
It was very hot, then he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> want </ERR> to <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> swimming </ERR> by the side of the River.. <ERR type=[fm3,-]> suddenly </ERR> , he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> food </ERR> something sparking .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,6-4]> take </ERR> it to the town , and <ERR type=[vp6,12-1]> sell </ERR> it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> a </ERR> car hit him down and he was hurt .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> was sent to a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hosptal </ERR> .
Two <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moath </ERR> later the doctor said," <ERR type=[fm3,-]> next </ERR> week you will go <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> back </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,5-7]> our </ERR> home.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> you </ERR> can write with <ERR type=[np4,s-]> you </ERR> hand "" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> oh </ERR> really?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> schools boys and girls are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> leaning </ERR> languages.
The teacher told us <ERR type=[wd4,5-2]> there </ERR> about 1500, she also said that English is one of the most important languages because so many people use it, not only in England and America, but in other <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contries </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,5-1]> of </ERR> world, so <ERR type=[vp4,1-6]> study </ERR> English is very important for us , if we study English well, it will be very useful for us.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> some </ERR> girls who study English found that it is difficult to study English.
For example, <ERR type=[wd7,3-5]> hare </ERR> some difficulty in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> produacing </ERR> some <ERR type=[wd3,6-]> world </ERR> , <ERR type=[vp4,5-5]> make </ERR> this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> into other <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> because </ERR> of these <ERR type=[np6,4-]> reason </ERR> , they found English is very hard to learn.
The teacher told us that who find English is hard to learn as they don't find the best way to <ERR type=[np7,4-2]> learn </ERR> foreign language .
Which is the best way to learn a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> foreignage </ERR> ?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> if </ERR> we learn a second language in the same way , it won't seem so difficult.
He <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> listen </ERR> to what people say and he tries to guess what people say.
So we learn English should be speak it as much as possible and using and thinking in it as <ERR type=[wd3,7-3]> many </ERR> as you can.
I hope all the boys and <ERR type=[np6,s-]> girl </ERR> will learn English well.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> had wide knowledge in foreign languages.
He could <ERR type=[wd4,3-5]> read </ERR> all the main European languages, and write in French and English.
He said:" A foreign <ERR type=[fm1,-]> languge </ERR> is very important in one's life.
" Marx was born in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Cermany </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> he was very young , he was forced to leave his motherland because of his revolutionary reasons.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> stayed in France for a <ERR type=[wd3,7-]> time </ERR> , but before long, he had to move on again.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> made rapid progress and soon he began to write articles in English for a newspaper.
In fact, in one of these articles his English was so good that Engels wrote him a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> setter </ERR> and praised him for it .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> he wrote the Civil War in France, he had mastered English so well that he was able to write in it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> the 1870's, when Marx was already over 50, he began to learn Russian because he wanted to study the situation in Russian <ERR type=[fm3,-]> .by </ERR> the end of six months he had learned enough to read articles and reports in Russian.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> the same way, the person who has learned a new language always translates it into his own.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> father is forty-four years old.
He <ERR type=[np7,s]> is </ERR> worker and works in a big factory called Xing Fei.
When I was two years old, he was working in Bei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Jing </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> one </ERR> day the <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd2,2-2]> electrycal </ERR> hit him and he was quickly taken to hospital.
He <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sleeped </ERR> two days and he woke up at last.
When I was a little <ERR type=[wd3,6-5]> bigger </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> father </ERR> often worked in factory, so he had no time to play with me.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> after </ERR> that he worked more <ERR type=[ad3,4-]> hard </ERR> and he became irritable <ERR type=[fm3,-][wd3,s-]> .sometime </ERR> I had a <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> little </ERR> mistake or I had no mistake at all he said to me angrily when he was unhappy.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> best days I think Summer Holidays.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> those day I can forget all the <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> sad </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,7-1]> in </ERR> life.
I can go into the nature and play all the time, so that I can put all the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> spirited </ERR> into the study of the next term.
My parents <ERR type=[wd2,3-5]> advice </ERR> me to go for sports , but sometimes I want to play computer games all the day at home.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-]> weather </ERR> is very hot and it's very uninteresting at home.
I think <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> play </ERR> in the water was more interesting than <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> play </ERR> on the land.
The next summer <ERR type=[np6,s-]> holidays </ERR> is about to come.
I <ERR type=[vp6,10-5]> was </ERR> ready to jump into it
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> everyone </ERR> has his or her mother.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> love each other very much!
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> reason is I love her.
So my favourite song is "The story in my heart".Sixteen years ago, I was born <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> in </ERR> the world.
Everyday, she <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> have </ERR> to work hard.
She <ERR type=[vp3,2-5]> have </ERR> to look after me carefully, she also <ERR type=[vp3,3-4]> have </ERR> to do much housework.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> sixteen </ERR> years, it's rather a long time, my mother had worked for so many days had no words.
She is the person who <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tought </ERR> me the first <ERR type=[wd4,10-8]> word, </ERR> she is the person who <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tought </ERR> me walk.
Now, I'm growing <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> up </ERR> , but she is more and more <ERR type=[aj3,6-]> older </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> how </ERR> great my mother is!
I can't live without my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> monther </ERR> .
We can't live without <ERR type=[pr4,s-]> ours </ERR> mothers.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> are owners of the world.
" Now I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> singing this beautiful song with my heart.

I love my home, I <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> love </ERR> family members, too.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> this </ERR> story happened years ago.
When I studied at a middle school, I liked riding my old <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bick </ERR> to go to school.
One day, when I was on my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> may </ERR> home after school, my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bick </ERR> refused to work.

" I <ERR type=[fm3,-]> don't </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> woriy </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> let </ERR> me see.
" He <ERR type=[fm1,-]> smilled </ERR> and got out some tools.
I looked at him while he was to <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> working </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> in </ERR> my bike.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> in </ERR> blue and middle-aged.
At first I thought he was a bicycle repair man, but later I knew he was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> b </ERR> worker and also on his way home.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> OK, now.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> "go </ERR> home quickly.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> your </ERR> parents must be waiting for you at home.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> looking </ERR> at his dirty hands I <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> than </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bed </ERR> him gain and again.
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> don't </ERR> mention it .every fm3,-] one needs help," he smiled and got on his bike and soon disappeared in the dark.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> even </ERR> today I till remember him.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> today </ERR> is sunny ,the sky is very blue, and no wind .
At the <ERR type=[wd7,3-2]> running </ERR> , eight runners <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> both </ERR> try their best to run fast.
The first one is our classmate Li Yun and <ERR type=[pr6,10-2]> another </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> shout </ERR> loudly "come on ,come on!

<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> made two friends.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> helped him, when he was older, one day he saw an old friend of his.
They helped him to <ERR type=[np7,s-]> be </ERR> king.
This film <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> win </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> severel </ERR> Oscar <ERR type=[np3,3-]> Prize </ERR> .
I have a lot of friends, from when I'm a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> childe </ERR> I thought everyone must have friends.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> I got everywhere I can make friends.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I stayed in the <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> childrens </ERR> ' <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> house </ERR> .
I found a girl who <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> beautiful and lovely.
I wanted to make <ERR type=[vp2,s-]> friend </ERR> with her.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> later </ERR> I knew her name is Zhao bo .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> she </ERR> is a good girl.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I left the childrens' <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> house </ERR> and went into school.
I left <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> with </ERR> Zhaobo, however, I remember her for ever .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> then </ERR> I <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> founded </ERR> Pan Ling, <ERR type=[pr5,6-6]> which </ERR> has a pair of big eyes and a lovely mouth .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> she </ERR> very clever and got very well with her studies.
We studied each <ERR type=[wd4,-]> other,played </ERR> each other.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> when we were in the Grade 4.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> we must be <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd3,10-]> devide </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> were <ERR type=[vp6,7-]> crying </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> after </ERR> five years ,we still write <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> letters </ERR> each other.
When I'm in the senior school, I made friends with everyone, but Liu weling is my <ERR type=[wd5,4-2]> the </ERR> best friend, we talk, laugh, study, play together, I lope we don't <ERR type=[wd3,11-]> devide </ERR> , if it is possible, I will thank God .
I will say:" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> thank </ERR> you, my God!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> friends </ERR> are part of my life.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> could </ERR> you <ERR type=[vp2,1-3]> make </ERR> friend with me?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I was young , I had ever made a joke.
The first lesson was English, the teacher taught us some sentences which used <ERR type=[wd3,9-]> usually </ERR> .
I recorded <ERR type=[fm1,-]> then </ERR> though I didn't know what they meant.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> teacher who taught me English asked me: "what's your name?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> teacher smiled to me I think <ERR type=[fm3,-]> :"the </ERR> teacher <ERR type=[vp6,5-6]> was </ERR> smiling , my answer must be right.
" <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> I was very happy, because I said a right answer by myself .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> when I know the truth, my face turned red at <ERR type=[wd5,2-]> me </ERR> .
I said to myself: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "you </ERR> are very foolish, you mustn't make the same joke!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> I was interested in English from then on.
I must thank <ERR type=[wd5,-]> to </ERR> this joke, because it <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp6,s-]> eruacrage </ERR> me to like English and learn it <ERR type=[wd3,10-]> hard </ERR> .
I think the joke <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> very good.
as there are over 1200000000 people in <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> the </ERR> China .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> why the most popular language in the world is English, not Chinese?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> there </ERR> must be a political reason in history.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> tens </ERR> of thousands of people said that China was the strongest country.
Also, China was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> considied </ERR> to be the largest market in the world.
They looked down upon Chinese , taking up many land <ERR type=[np3,5-3][fm1,-]> whick </ERR> belonged to china.

Lei Kai A FAITHFUL <ERR type=[fm1,-]> POG </ERR>
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> more </ERR> than seven hundred years ago, the Prince of Wales had a very big and brave pig, Gelert.
He wagged his tail and jumped <ERR type=[fm1,-]> u0p </ERR> to put his paws on the Prince's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cheat </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> "what </ERR> have you done?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> rushed into his home and looked for his baby son.
The cradle was lying <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> in </ERR> its side on the floor.
The clothes were <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tom </ERR> and there was blood on them.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> "so </ERR> you have killed my son!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> you </ERR> unfaithful pig!
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> took out his sword and killed the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> peg </ERR> .
Just as Gelert was dying, he managed <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> back for a moment.
Then the Prince heard a baby call <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> to </ERR> the pig.
The prince <ERR type=[fm1,-]> can </ERR> out of the house and saw his son lying on the ground <ERR type=[fm3,-]> unhurt?-if </ERR> you <ERR type=[wd7,3-5]> of </ERR> to Mount Snowdon in Walas ,people will show you where Gelert is buried.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> country is China, with its capital Beijing.
In the eastern part is rather flat ,although there are hills in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> northest </ERR> and in the southeast of it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> the western part has many mountains, for example, Ti'an <ERR type=[fm3,-]> mountain </ERR> Qi lian <ERR type=[fm3,-]> mountain </ERR> , and so on.
China is made up of 32 provinces, for example, my hometown He nan <ERR type=[fm3,-]> province </ERR> .
Hu bei <ERR type=[fm3,-]> province </ERR> , and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> China, most people live mainly on wheat and rice .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> the northeast, people grow wheat.
In China the southern part <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> much </ERR> water than the northern part.
So, the southern part <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> should </ERR> grow rice, and the northern <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> should </ERR> grow wheat, China <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> have </ERR> many <ERR type=[wd3,4-4]> production </ERR> , for example, <ERR type=[np5,7-1]> teas </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> China </ERR> , coal, oil, pears, and so on .

<ERR type=[fm3,-]> now </ERR> we want to get <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> back </ERR> Hong Kong.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> let's </ERR> look <ERR type=[vp2,s-]> forward </ERR> this moment: July 1st 1997.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> here </ERR> , I tell you a story about Du Qiu niang.
She was a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> farmous </ERR> dancer in Jin Ling of Tang period.
At young <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> old </ERR> , she <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> recognized </ERR> Zhu Ying.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> were after play together.

<ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> at </ERR> one day.
she met emperor Xuan Zhong, who was <ERR type=[fm1,-][aj1,3-2]> simler </ERR> Zhu Ying, she was very <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> worry </ERR> .
But, Xuan Zhong was used to <ERR type=[vp4,6-5]> see </ERR> her and she <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> become </ERR> happy.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> she </ERR> sang and danced with Xuan Zhong loved her, she also loved him .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> about seven years <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> after </ERR> .
Mu Zhong <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> was </ERR> emperor of Tang period.
Du qiu niang <ERR type=[fm1,-]> taugh </ERR> a son of Mu Zhong.
At forty of her , she <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> came </ERR> back her hometown and <ERR type=[vp6,7-3]> lead </ERR> a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> smiple </ERR> life, but she very happy.
Du Qui niang was a famous dancer <ERR type=[np7,s-]> and </ERR> pretty woman.
She could sing, dance, draw and <ERR type=[cc3,1-1]> make </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,2-]> poem </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> she </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,2-1]> made </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,3-]> poem </ERR> is Jin Liy, which persuaded people to make progress.
HAND <ERR type=[fm1,-]> SIHNS </ERR> LANGUAGE
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> there </ERR> is one language that is for use in every country in the world.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> every <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> body </ERR> 's second language.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> easy to learn and easy to understand.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> sign language.
When you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ware </ERR> to a friend who is <ERR type=[wd3,5-3]> across </ERR> by the street, you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ate </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-][np7,s-]> hsing </ERR> sign language.
When you smile to someone, you are saying, "I want to be <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> made </ERR> friend," but you are not speaking.
When you <ERR type=[vp1,3-4]> rise </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,4-3]> your </ERR> and in class, you are saying," Please ask me, I think I know the correct answer.
" Babies who can't talk can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pornt </ERR> at think .

He's to <ERR type=[vp6,s-][np7,s-]> use </ERR> sign language.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> television </ERR> has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mow </ERR> come to nearly every family in the world.
It has become a very important part in <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> the </ERR> people's life.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> many </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> school </ERR> in China have <ERR type=[np6,s-]> television </ERR> .
Some <ERR type=[wd5,2-7]> of </ERR> feel that television is good for children because it helps them learn about their country and the world.
It also helps children to do every <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> thing </ERR> better in <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> the </ERR> school.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> feel that there are too many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> programes </ERR> about love and crime on TV.
And that even programmes of education don't help children's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enducation </ERR> .
If they watch TV, they don't need <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> talk </ERR> .
When school children watch TV, they read a lot <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> less </ERR> .
Because of this they don't learn to read or write <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> as </ERR> quickly at school.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> they watch TV, they play less.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Tat </ERR> first it was difficult but soon a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sot </ERR> of good changes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> children read, played, and exercised more, and the family became full of joy.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> at the end <ERR type=[np7,55-8]> of </ERR> month all the families began to watch TV as much as before.
<ERR type=[fm3,-][wd3,s-]> not </ERR> one family is able to give up television completely.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> which </ERR> language is spoken by the largest number of people in the world?
<ERR type=[fm3,-][wd4,1-2]> in </ERR> modern world, English becomes more important and more <ERR type=[aj3,7-]> important </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> many </ERR> things with instruction <ERR type=[vp3,5-2]> is </ERR> in English, such <ERR type=[fm1,-]> us </ERR> "made in ?-?-,turn on, turn off.
" Some <ERR type=[wd3,2-6]> times </ERR> we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wath </ERR> TV or <ERR type=[np7,6-1]> see </ERR> film, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> that </ERR> 're also in English.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> if </ERR> we go broad, first we must be able to speak English.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> we must learn English hard, if we have some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffecince </ERR> we <ERR type=[vp9,7-2]> can't </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,8-1]> afraid </ERR> it.
I think if we learn hard, we can master English <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whis </ERR> is the most widely.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> house is not very big, but I like it very much.
If you get into my house, on your right is a book <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> shape </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> on </ERR> your left, there is a bike, it's my mother's.

We reach the side of hills at 9:00. <ERR type=[fm3,-]> after </ERR> we have a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Litte </ERR> rest, we begin to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chimb </ERR> the hills.
At first, we laughs and sings, but after one hour, feel very tried, but when we see the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beautful </ERR> sights, which the big hills and many green trees are there, the tired is run away.
The sun <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> likes </ERR> a piece of gold.

<ERR type=[vp6,1-11]> It's </ERR> difficult to eat them and I <ERR type=[wd3,8-2]> made </ERR> them out, mother was angry and ordered me to eat them.
I was still <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp7,4-4]> woried </ERR> , I couldn't see any thing, as there <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> was </ERR> full of tears and my throat was <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> pain </ERR> .

" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> mother </ERR> became happy, there was a big <ERR type=[fm1,-]> smele </ERR> on her face, I took all the medicine.
Although <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> it's </ERR> difficult to eat the sky turned blue and the sun appeared.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> the morning, I get up at 6:20.

Qian Lu Ji Qiong " is <ERR type=[np7,6-1]> a </ERR> idiom.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> about <ERR type=[np7,s-]> a </ERR> interesting story.
The text as follows: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> long </ERR> long ago, there <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> not donkeys in the place called" Qian".
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> a </ERR> person took a donkey here by <ERR type=[fm1,-]> boay </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> discovered this donkey, which was too big.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> tiger was so afraid, it considered the donkey as the god.
A few days later, the tiger walked out of the forest, came to the donkey <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> slowly, </ERR> looked at it carefully.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> , the tiger still didn't know what the donkey was.
One day, the donkey <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> howl </ERR> suddenly.
The tiger <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thinked </ERR> the donkey would come to eat <ERR type=[pr1,10-]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> , </ERR> hurried up and went into the forest.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> however </ERR> , the donkey didn't <ERR type=[vp3,4-1]> came </ERR> here.
After a few days the tiger <ERR type=[vp3,3-5]> come </ERR> to the donkey once more, and it <ERR type=[wd4,2-7]> discovered </ERR> the donkey didn't have the special ability and <ERR type=[vp2,2-4]> used </ERR> to listening its howl.
As a result, the tiger <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> closed </ERR> to donkey much nearer, and moved on in front of the donkey.
At last, the tiger <ERR type=[vp1,3-3]> collided </ERR> the donkey's body, the donkey was <ERR type=[wd4,4-5]> cross, </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,1-4]> kicked </ERR> tiger with its feet.
because <ERR type=[pr1,7-7]> it </ERR> thought that the donkey had little ability, it was very foolish.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> one </ERR> of the doctors of medicine was Li Shi zhen in China, he was very great in history.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> was born in 1518 Ad and lived in Qi chun, <ERR type=[wd5,5-3]> in </ERR> Hu bei province.
When he was a child, he studied hard and usually <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> help </ERR> his parents to do housework.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> his </ERR> father and grandfather were both doctors.
so he was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> instaested </ERR> in medicine, he wanted to <ERR type=[cc3,4-2]> grow </ERR> a doctor.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> was very friendly to <ERR type=[wd7,6-1]> par </ERR> people, sometimes he didn't ask them for money.
He found <ERR type=[wd3,3-5]> these </ERR> were many problems <ERR type=[wd3,7-1]> on </ERR> them, so he decided to write a medicine book.
He had been to many cities which lied <ERR type=[wd3,4-5][np7,3-2]> on </ERR> Chang Jiang <ERR type=[np7,6-2]> and </ERR> Yellow <ERR type=[fm3,-]> river </ERR> ,he also visited many mountains and forests.
He asked people for <ERR type=[wd2,5-1]> medicine </ERR> problem and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wllected </ERR> all kinds of medicine.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> sometimes </ERR> , he tried to plant them.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> took him about 27 years to write the book which was called Ben Chan Gang Mu.
This book was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> considaed </ERR> to be an important summary of the knowledge of medicine.
It was translated into many languages and studied <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> much </ERR> too widely.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> present there are not many Milu deer in <ERR type=[wd3,8-3]> nature </ERR> parks in China, but the number is increasing every year.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> however </ERR> , it disappeared during the Ming and the Qing periods.
Too many of the deer had been killed and the disappeared .Until recently, the only milu deer <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aliwe </ERR> in the world belonged to the Duke of Bedford in <ERR type=[wd2,8-]> English </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> liked the cool wet weather there and their number increased year by year.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> present, the biggest <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> nature </ERR> park for milu deer in China is the Nan hai Zi Milu park, which is about 20 kilometres south of Bei jing.
It is an important <ERR type=[fm1,-]> reseach </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contre </ERR> for nature and wildlife.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> life of the milu is being <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shidiced </ERR> there.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> first <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dur </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ariveck </ERR> at the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> autre </ERR> in 1985 from Britain.
By 1993 the number of milu deer at the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ceutre </ERR> had grown from 20 to more than 200.
Another <ERR type=[fm1,-]> autre </ERR> for mile deer is in Da feng in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Jaysu </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Prruince </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-9]> , </ERR> 1985, 39 milu deer were brought to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prouince </ERR> from Britain.
Well, I <ERR type=[vp4,2-1]> want </ERR> say I like milu, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Because </ERR> the Milu deer <ERR type=[wd5,4-3]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> stand </ERR> for nature.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> many </ERR> people have asked me, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "which </ERR> is the most beautiful country you have ever seen?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> are </ERR> always surprised if they had been there.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Mexio </ERR> has beautiful people, beautiful flowers and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fcrests </ERR> , towns and villages.
Come with me and we shall climb <ERR type=[fm3,-]> popo </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> shall start our climb about three o'clock in the morning.
We must get as high up as we can before down , for the sun will <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> born </ERR> our faces terribly <ERR type=[np7,1-3]> at </ERR> so high place.
Remember, we're going to climb almost eighteen <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thouand </ERR> feet.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> Down </ERR> begins to <ERR type=[cc2,4-]> break </ERR> , and the sky grows red behind <ERR type=[wd7,6-1]> to </ERR> top, a hundred miles away.
As we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> go </ERR> higher, the wind becomes stronger.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> rising sun burns our eyes.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> taking </ERR> three steps in the snow, then three minutes rest, we fight on.
THE <ERR type=[fm1,-]> UELLOW </ERR> CRANE <ERR type=[fm1,-]> TOUER </ERR>

1985 the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> newly-rebuit </ERR> Yellow <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Crnane </ERR> Tower (Klwanghe Tower) was completed and opened to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pubie </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[wd5,2-4]> we </ERR> building of the tower took four years and cost 15million yuan.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> this </ERR> five-storeyed building stands on the top of the Siake Hill by the hand Jinang River in Hubei Province.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> is 51.4 metres high.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Prictunes </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Portrants </ERR> and wall-paintings.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> are about <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fairly </ERR> tales, Chinese history and the history of the <ERR type=[wd3,5-6]> tour </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> do </ERR> you know when the tower was first built?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> there </ERR> is a legend that long.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Long </ERR> ago are old man named Wang Zhian rode on the back of a yellow crane .
flew away from the tower and later became an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tmmortal </ERR> being .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> is also said that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> anther </ERR> man <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> raved </ERR> .
Fei wei wei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> retuatted </ERR> to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> toner </ERR> to have a rest with the help of a yellow crane.
Another story goes like this: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,2-10]> window </ERR> by the name of <ERR type=[fm3,-]> xin </ERR> set up a public house by the Suake Hill in WuChand.
The Taoist drew a yellow crane flew down off the wall and danced happily immediately after the people <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> dapped </ERR> their hands .
On hearing the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> new </ERR> many .
Many people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cane </ERR> here for a drink.
So <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> decided to build a tower in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> menoy </ERR> of the crane.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> was named the Yellow Crane Tower.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> fact, the Yellow Crane Tower was first built more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> them </ERR> 1,600 years ago.
That is in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> taring </ERR> year of the Three-kingdom period.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> October 1981 the government decided to rebuild the Tower and on the top of the Snake Hill stands a new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mang </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nifrcent </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> five-storiyed </ERR> Yellow Crane Tower .
<ERR type=[wd3,4-5]> over </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,5-4]> looking </ERR> the beautiful river city of Wu han.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> the United States if you want to invite a friend to dinner you must tell him the place and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tine </ERR> one or two weeks before hand.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> the same time you should tell him who else besides him will come to the dinner.
If you are the person invited and you accept the <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> invited </ERR> you'd better keep your promise and go <ERR type=[np7,6-3]> to </ERR> dinner on time.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> least you <ERR type=[vp8,2-14]> mustn't </ERR> change your mind at your pleasure if something unexpected really prevents you from coming, you must tell the host or hostess about it several days before the dinner for at that time the host or hostess must have begun to go shopping and prepare for the dinner it is always considered impolite to tell the host or hostess that you are not able to <ERR type=[vp4,6-4]> came </ERR> at the last minute.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> most </ERR> Americans think that ice cream is as American as baseball and basketball.

There is a story that <ERR type=[wd3,6-7]> be </ERR> ordered his cook to keep the recipe for ice cream a royal secret.Today ice cream is known by the world.
But I don't think ice cream is a healthy <ERR type=[np6,3-]> diets </ERR> , because it's high in fat and sugar.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> sugar </ERR> is not a necessary part of a healthy diet.
Though ice cream is very delicious, <ERR type=[cj1,s-]> but </ERR> you'd better eat less.

THE DIET <ERR type=[np7,3-1]> OF </ERR> ENGLISH <ERR type=[np7,5-1]> AND </ERR> AMERICAN
English and American diet has a lot of differences <ERR type=[fm1,-][np7,s-]> form </ERR> Chinese diet.
<ERR type=[pr2,1-2]> On </ERR> the morning, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Generally </ERR> , most <ERR type=[wd5,2-4]> of </ERR> families have their breakfast from 7:30 to 8:30.
They eat fruit at <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> the </ERR> first.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> after </ERR> that, they eat thin pieces that are <ERR type=[wd2,7-2]> make </ERR> of rain <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> with </ERR> milk.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> sometimes </ERR> they eat bread.
All <ERR type=[wd5,2-4]> of </ERR> the people of <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> English </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd3,6-]> American </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> who </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> works </ERR> very hard so that they can't go home to have their lunch.
As a result,some of them can take only a bit of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sandwishes </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> some </ERR> of them can also go to the restaurant to have their lunch.
<ERR type=[np7,s-]> The </ERR> supper is the most important meal in a day.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> dinner </ERR> means on Sunday or someone's birthday or especial days that is prepared.Most of the family take off their old clothes and then put on <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> another </ERR> new clothes before the supper.
People eat the fruit or drink <ERR type=[wd3,6-]> wind </ERR> or have some drinks at <ERR type=[wd3,5-3]> first </ERR> of the dinner.
<ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scend </ERR> , they drink soup, sometimes they can drink it with bread or butter.
<ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> the </ERR> third they eat fish, eat, vegetables, salad, potato chips and rice.
A <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> usual </ERR> family spent less time on dinner.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> The </ERR> fourth, after the meal, they eat fruit or ice <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gream </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> The </ERR> fifth, they drink coffee, in other parts of the countries for example, English also eat some cheese before the coffee .
So Chinese diet has a lot of differences from English and American diet, Chinese diet is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wnsided </ERR> to be the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> healthest </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> not </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> only </ERR> English and American <ERR type=[vp3,6-4]> has </ERR> this kind of diet, but also most of the westerners as same as them .
I often go to the P.E centre to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plan </ERR> Ping -Pong ball.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I'm playing it, I forget all other things.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> ever </ERR> I turn on the radio, I <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> turn </ERR> in to music programs.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> many </ERR> people dislike advertisements on TV, but I like them.
I think advertisements on CCTV are of high quality <ERR type=[fm3,-]> .they </ERR> interesting and attractive .
Many people in my hometown are handsome or pretty, and the street <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bights </ERR> make them look prettier.
I often try to talk in English with my sisters in my spoken <ERR type=[wd5,3-]> English </ERR> .
I felt my knowledge is so rich that he often <ERR type=[vp3,2-6]> tell </ERR> us many wish was broken.
At last, in the four days, I studied as if I <ERR type=[np3,1-3]> storied </ERR> about natural science, and he often toll us was in school.
In the evening we often do <ERR type=[np5,1-0]> homeworks </ERR> or go ver the text.
Though we are free to do what we like, we can't speak or go <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> away </ERR> the seat.
When we had <ERR type=[np6,3-]> question </ERR> , we could ask the teacher in time.
In the new term I <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> got </ERR> to another class.
I began to know <ERR type=[wd5,4-2]> the </ERR> other friends.
In this week the weather <ERR type=[vp6,5-4]> wasn't </ERR> fine.
We had to take ff the shoes when we had <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> lesson </ERR> .
I hope the bad weather <ERR type=[vp6,5-1]> didn't </ERR> continue.
The <ERR type=[fm3,-]> mid-autumn </ERR> Day passed, but I didn't forget what d happened in that evening.
In that evening I <ERR type=[vp6,7-3]> would </ERR> the moon <ERR type=[wd2,5-0]> clear </ERR> .
At that time I had to go to bed, otherwise I couldn't get up and go to school in time <ERR type=[wd5,0-3]> in </ERR> the next day.
Mother and me went <ERR type=[vp2,2-1]> to </ERR> hopping, but I had to do homework <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> at </ERR> that afternoon.
Though had four holidays , I had four <ERR type=[np4,3-1]> week's </ERR> homeworks.
[np5,2-0] I must go over English, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> History </ERR> ,maths and politics, because we will have four <ERR type=[np4,3-1]> subject's </ERR> test after holidays.
I must do a lot of exercises and <ERR type=[fm1,-][np5,2-0]> homewoks </ERR> of every subject.
<ERR type=[wd4,0-7]> Except </ERR> I must write a composition of <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> , now I must finish this English daily at first.
Though we went over <ERR type=[wd5,0-1]> the </ERR> history, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eacher </ERR> said we didn't have a test in this week.
Otherwise we must have a test of <ERR type=[wd4,0-1]> history </ERR> Friday .
<ERR type=[pp1,1-3]> In </ERR> this several weeks , several new teachers came to our school and practised to <ERR type=[vp5,9-1]> each </ERR> us.
When they were <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> taking </ERR> lessons, <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> the </ERR> some teachers of our school must <ERR type=[vp1,5-6]> listen </ERR> how hey told in the classroom.
The teachers often sit near <ERR type=[pr4,-]> I </ERR> .
I had to listen more <ERR type=[wd2,5-]> careful </ERR> than the other lessons.
We had a school sports meet in the Worker Stadium <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> at </ERR> Friday afternoon.
This sports <ERR type=[fm1,-]> meet't </ERR> size was the largest than before this .
I and five <ERR type=[wd1,3-0]> classmates </ERR> held the national flag and walked more than one hundred <ERR type=[np5,1-0]> metre </ERR> in the opening ceremony.
Though we were all ver <ERR type=[vp6,5-0]> sweat </ERR> , we finished it very <ERR type=[ad2,4-0]> good </ERR> .
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> e're </ERR> alway the BEST!
Our <ERR type=[np6,2-3]> sportsman </ERR> tried their best in this sports meet.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> In </ERR> Saturday morning the sport meet continued.
The match was very nervous and <ERR type=[cc4,6-0]> fiery </ERR> .
We will have two subjects ' test <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> in </ERR> the next week.
We had a <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> test <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> in </ERR> this k. This <ERR type=[vp6,1-9]> was </ERR> the first <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> test since the trainee d3,2-3] taught us <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> wasn't easy.
Three days passed, the <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> trainee </ERR> changed the papers.
I was only sixty <ERR type=[wd7,4-0]> cent </ERR> .
But I will try my best to study <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> in order to improve it.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-10]> was </ERR> the last week.
We had a meeting before they <ERR type=[vp6,13-1]> went </ERR> back.
when they played games, we couldn't help <ERR type=[vp5,3-0]> laugh </ERR> .
Finally we sent them <ERR type=[np6,-]> present </ERR> and two cards which wrote <ERR type=[fm1,-]> doun </ERR> our names.
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> In </ERR> Thursday morning they sent us a new football.
The football must <ERR type=[vp4,-]> kept </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,4-3]> with </ERR> our head teacher.
Though the students who came from training college <ERR type=[fm3,-]> will </ERR> leave, I hope we can <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> see </ERR> their shadow in our school in the future.
It passed nine weeks <ERR type=[wd5,5-0]> in </ERR> this term.
We will have <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Mid-term </ERR> examination <ERR type=[wd4,> in </ERR> 0- 2] eleventh week.
We have little time to <ERR type=[cc3,1-3]> go </ERR> over the knowledge.
<ERR type=[wd5,0-5]> This </ERR> we must examine eight subjects, and the <ERR type=[cc2,1-5]> history </ERR> must examine all the knowledge in the book.
If I had gone over earlier, I would have <ERR type=[vp1,-]> prepared </ERR> well.
That <ERR type=[fm2,-]> meaned </ERR> the autumn was coming.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> leaves of the trees turned yellow and fell down.
This week <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> was </ERR> the last week before the mid-term examination.
We would <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> spend </ERR> all our time <ERR type=[wd3,6-4]> on </ERR> going over every <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> subjects </ERR> .
We could have a rest at home <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> two days.
<ERR type=[wd3,2]> At </ERR> the afternoon I always <ERR type=[vp6,7-2]> go </ERR> to bed.
Except that, I would go <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> over </ERR> the knowledge.
One night I <ERR type=[vp2,1-3]> listened </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,0-2]> a </ERR> English song.
It <ERR type=[vp7,> called </ERR> 1- 2] " <ERR type=[fm3,-]> here </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> waiting" </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[ad2,3]> very </ERR> like this song.
In our class my place was <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> twenty-five </ERR> .
That <ERR type=[fm2,-]> meaned </ERR> I was <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> going </ERR> backward.
My <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> , English and <ERR type=[cc2,0-3]> politics </ERR> didn't study well.
In <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> next term he will try my best to improve them in order to <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> lift </ERR> my place.
<ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> In </ERR> Saturday our school <ERR type=[wd3,2-9]> formed </ERR> us to go to Xi Chao <ERR type=[wd3,8-2]> as </ERR> a trip.
If I had worn the clothes <ERR type=[wd1,2-0]> enough </ERR> , I shouldn't have got a bad cold.
But I wouldn't give in <ERR type=[wd5,4-0]> it </ERR> .In this weather we must have sports.
Otherwise I <ERR type=[vp9,1-2]> must </ERR> got fever.
And two impostors got to <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> professor </ERR> Hunter's house at half past ten.
I like to <ERR type=[vp2,1-1]> listen </ERR> music and like to sing songs, too.I usually <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> listen </ERR> Chinese songs more than English <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ngs </ERR> .
But I also <ERR type=[ad2,2-4]> very </ERR> like some English songs.
I don't know some <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> songs </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> name </ERR> .
e must often <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> listen </ERR> English songs and sing them.
I think that it isn't <ERR type=[wd2,5-0]> well </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> In </ERR> this time our main duty <ERR type=[wd4,5-1]> is </ERR> study.
Some students <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> must </ERR> Wear clothes.
We went there early in order that we <ERR type=[vp6,8-5]> have </ERR> enough time to make up.
We spent two hours <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> on </ERR> making up.
At last we <ERR type=[vp9,-]> must </ERR> go to act.
But someone <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> affect </ERR> us.
All of us were very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disspointed </ERR> .
[vp7,2-0] The final exam is coming.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> have nine days to go over.
But my English <ERR type=[cc4,-2]> base </ERR> isn't good.
I forgot the words very <ERR type=[wd2,5-0]> easy </ERR> , and I didn't remember again in time.
My <ERR type=[cc4,1-3]> English </ERR> feeling isn't good.
My <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> <ERR type=[cc4,2-2]> base </ERR> isn't good.
When I was doing my <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> homework, my father was cleaning the kitchen .
We must <ERR type=[cc3,2-3]> prepare </ERR> the new knowledge and <ERR type=[cc3,1-4]> go </ERR> over the old knowledge in this winter holiday.
We had only thirteen days to do it so that I had almost finished the homework before February 1.Except maths and physics, I <ERR type=[vp9,1-9]> must </ERR> wasted a long time to work out every question.
I think I <ERR type=[vp9,3-2]> will </ERR> very light-hearted in February 7.
I had prepared some sweets and some <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> cookie </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd2,9-3]> past </ERR> the Spring Festival.
There were some <ERR type=[np6,1-6]> market </ERR> on each side of the road.
After breakfast we went to <ERR type=[cc3,1-3]> give </ERR> the relative congratulations.
Though that, I must <ERR type=[cc3,2-3]> go </ERR> over the knowledge.
I used to watch TV or <ERR type=[vp2,1-1]> listen </ERR> music.
Finally I decided to break <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> away </ERR> the habit.
Every day I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> permited </ERR> myself to watch the news in the evening.
In the public <ERR type=[np6,-0]> holiday </ERR> I watched TV at most one hour.
I will break <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> away </ERR> the habit before <ERR type=[vp5,1-2]> go </ERR> to school.
At that time I think I can break <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> away </ERR> the habit completely.
What's the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> mean </ERR> ?
I saw a man who <ERR type=[vp6,5-4]> can </ERR> not speak sit down at the other table beside us.
But mother had seen <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> that </ERR> what had happened and ordered some food which I <ERR type=[vp6,5-0]> like </ERR> .
It was the first week <ERR type=[pp1,-3]> at </ERR> the next term.
A lot of leaves <ERR type=[fm2,-]> spreaded </ERR> all over the table.
But that week had <ERR type=[vp6,4-0]> gone </ERR> .
So the poor children could <ERR type=[cc3,1-5]> learn </ERR> the knowledge of all sides.
They thought this experiment <ERR type=[vp9,4-3]> could </ERR> reproduced some organs what the patients needed.The second piece of news was about examination.
We must have a <ERR type=[wd3,-]> hearing </ERR> test in the examination.
I was afraid to have a <ERR type=[wd3,-]> hearing </ERR> test.
Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> is a modern city.
It had <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> been </ERR> a beautiful city.
The smog in Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> was sometimes so thick and filled with pollution.
The fog <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> have </ERR> so many harmful chemicals.
People who <ERR type=[vp6,2-10]> lived </ERR> in Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> saw the sky and found it wasn't blue.
It often <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> have </ERR> some fog.
[fm2,-] Otherwise it must do harm for our health.
Another problem of Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> is the pollution of the Zhu <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Jiang </ERR> River.
When I got to school, a lot of students who were our grade were waiting <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> the first floor.
We had to walk instead of running, because he street was very <ERR type=[wd3,12-]> smooth </ERR> .
So I thought it was worth running in the rainy day, because it had lost its <ERR type=[wd7,15-0]> meaning </ERR> .
Then we <ERR type=[vp9,s]> must </ERR> come back to school at once.
They hardly <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> makes </ERR> any movement.Sometimes I will play with them.
When I study <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> in </ERR> a long time, I will go to see them.
So I must take the raincoat <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> in </ERR> all day.
We had to study in chemical laboratory <ERR type=[wd3,7-2]> in </ERR> four days.
Every time many students play or have a lesson <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> the play ground.
There was a lot of noise <ERR type=[vp5,6-2]> affected </ERR> our study.
It often <ERR type=[vp3,2-0]> drive </ERR> us mad.
I was afraid the football <ERR type=[vp9,-]> hit </ERR> the top of the house suddenly.
After class we <ERR type=[vp9,3-2]> could </ERR> played badminton .
Someone played game <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> in </ERR> the play ground.
My family and my <ERR type=[wd4,6-6]> grandmother, </ERR> my aunt went to Victory Hotel for breakfast.
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> framily </ERR> and my grandmother's family often go the Hotel for breakfast in the festival now.
Because I wasted a day, I had to give going to the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> BaiYun </ERR> Mountain.
They didn't <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> go </ERR> home until turned dark.
They still <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> kept </ERR> on playing basketball.
[wd4,0-5] Saturday some <ERR type=[np6,s]> student </ERR> would <ERR type=[vp3,4-7]> come </ERR> to school and play basketball on it.
They <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> made </ERR> the school very busy.
It was difficult o see so busy before the new playground <ERR type=[vp7,11-1]> had </ERR> completed.
But I <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> hoped </ERR> it wouldn't affect their study.
Many graduates had <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> become </ERR> famous people.
There are two <ERR type=[np6,1-2]> building </ERR> of teaching and there is a building of experiment.
It has a big playground and students tend play or have a <ERR type=[wd3,-]> sport </ERR> on it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> the </ERR> all of students respect their teachers.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-6]> was </ERR> difficult for me to learn English.
Though I <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> was </ERR> weak in English, I found it interesting.
I <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> believed </ERR> I could study well.
In these years I read more books and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> writed </ERR> articles in English.
After a few day, I tried to write articles <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> in </ERR> newspaper.
I had <ERR type=[wd3,-]> ever </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> given </ERR> up.
They were <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> almost </ERR> good at swimming.
About ten years ago, I spent holidays in Beijing, it was the last time <ERR type=[wd5,5-2]> that </ERR> I swam.
I <ERR type=[vp6,1-15]> had </ERR> to tudy far into the night, because I had a lot of homework every day.
<ERR type=[wd4,-1]> Almost </ERR> people who live in Beijing go to work by bus or by bike.
More and more people play <ERR type=[wd3,0-1]> in </ERR> outskirts <ERR type=[wd3,0-1]> in </ERR> weekend.
Having gone over my lessons, I began to look at the sky through the window, instead of going to bed <ERR type=[fm1,-]> immediartely </ERR> .
This afternoon was very hot, the temperature s about <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> nearly </ERR> 30.
I used to swim in my childhood, but now I haven't <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> swam </ERR> for about ten years, I think June is one of the best months in a year.
[fm1,-] Let me introduce our class.
Our class is an <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> emphatic </ERR> class, and has fifty-two boys, eleven girls in it.
our class has two monitors, they are Wang Chuhui and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Caipeisan </ERR> .
We have <ERR type=[np6,2-4]> class </ERR> from Monday to Saturday.
We have eight <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> parts </ERR> of lessons every day.
The Middle <ERR type=[wd4,2-4]> Autumn </ERR> is a conventional festival in China, as the New Spring.
The people over our country will <ERR type=[wd3,6-3]> congratulate </ERR> in different form.
In the night you will see many children <ERR type=[cc3,3-1]> lifting </ERR> lanterns in the streets if you go out.
I ike he Middle <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> Autumn </ERR> very much.
All <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Thess </ERR> Things Are To Be <ERR type=[vp6,1-]> Answer </ERR>
No one will forget that miserable times <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> and </ERR> seasons.
How can <ERR type=[pr4,2-1]> us </ERR> forget!
In the days, many people were killed by the enemy; many women were raped by the enemy; and many <ERR type=[wd2,1-5]> riches </ERR> also were robbed by the enemy.
The Japanese Fascist brought <ERR type=[wd5,3-4]> with </ERR> heavy sufferings to Chinese and ever Asia.
But the Japanese Aggression are <ERR type=[cc2,4-6]> preparing </ERR> for the other sinister plot again when they have not <ERR type=[vp6,4-6]> pay </ERR> back for their criminal act still.
All the people of <ERR type=[wd2,-]> Chinese </ERR> will not let it go!
There are <ERR type=[cc1,-1]> colour </ERR> fish, peacock fish, dong yang knife fish and there two Bazie tortoises in it.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-7]> Over </ERR> the pond there's a man <ERR type=[fm2,-]> made </ERR> hill.
A waterfall <ERR type=[vp3,-]> drop </ERR> down from the hill into the pond.
In the water there's much <ERR type=[wd3,1-0]> send </ERR> , stones, corals and some water grasses in it.
The <ERR type=[np6,-]> goldfishes </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,-]> lead </ERR> a <ERR type=[cc1,-]> freedom </ERR> life, but don't safe,because the dong <ERR type=[fm3,-]> yong </ERR> knife fish will eat the little fish.
Now they live <ERR type=[ad1,2-1]> all </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happly </ERR> .
In autumn many leaves turn yellow, and many <ERR type=[np5]> fruits </ERR> have <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> riped </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> paddy </ERR> fields turn gold <ERR type=[wd5,4-6]> and </ERR> like sheet of gold sea.
But it's also easy to catch fire, so people have to <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> take </ERR> care <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tinders </ERR> .
As <ERR type=[np8,0-1]> much </ERR> people do, I like play football and watch football <ERR type=[fm2,-]> matchs </ERR> too.
In our school, many students play football <ERR type=[fm2,-]> matchs </ERR> after a day of study at school, and so <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> does </ERR> I. I felt <ERR type=[vp5,2-2]> relaxing </ERR> and exciting when I was playing the close game football with my classmases.
[fm1,-] I felt very <ERR type=[vp5,3-0]> exciting </ERR> when I kicked the football into the ball door.
Sometimes I watch football <ERR type=[fm2,-]> matchs </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,0-1]> in </ERR> home, including the Chinese and the foreign countrys.
[fm2,-] As all the football game fans do, I like the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> world </ERR> Cup best.
Such as these, football is a part in my <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> live </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> be </ERR> Professor Hunter saw through them and gave the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wroung </ERR> papers to them.
Again I haven't passed the English test again this week, even though I have done hard in <ERR type=[pp1,-]> it </ERR> .
But I think I have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> maken </ERR> progress.
I <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> certain </ERR> tell you I like the art festival in our school best.
The art festival this year will <ERR type=[vp7,6-9]> hold </ERR> in the PeiLei theatre on the New Year's Day <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> in </ERR> next year.
Many student of every grade and every class are rehearsing warmly for the art festival, and the same as our class.The art festival has rich content, for example: drawing, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> miting, </ERR> singing, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> drancing </ERR> <ERR type=[cc4,-]> ,little </ERR> making, little experiment and so on.
I think the art festival this year <ERR type=[vp9,7-7]> will </ERR> more excellent than the one last year.
I'm <ERR type=[vp2,1-3]> waiting </ERR> the art festival.
It's about one metre high, one metre wide and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> trenty </ERR> centimetres thick.
There are about one hundred books <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> my bookshelf, but the book about learning is over fifty percent.
Then other books are all kinds of dictionaries, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> navels, </ERR> poems and so on.
All these <ERR type=[cc4,2-5]> books </ERR> are my <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> riches </ERR> in knowledge.
I could not <ERR type=[cc3,3-3]> have </ERR> so much knowledge without book.
So I like the bookshelf for <ERR type=[wd5,4-0]> book </ERR> .
The Test Of The <ERR type=[cc1,1-1]> Term </ERR> End The test of this <ERR type=[cc1,1-1]> term </ERR> end is coming.
My <ERR type=[cc2,1-10]> achievement </ERR> stood in the lower reaches of river in my class.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> city is overwhelmed with joy, and the people <ERR type=[wd1,1-3]> all </ERR> are preparing some foods for the new year and cleaning their house for the now year too.
The same as passed, the weather is very cold <ERR type=[pr3,-1]> this </ERR> days, and with little rains.
Everybody is waiting in <ERR type=[wd4,1-4]> hope </ERR> the New Year's coming.
In the Spring Festival many people feel the <ERR type=[wd2,4-3]> happies </ERR> in a year and extraordinary a child do.
People <ERR type=[vp6,1-17]> would </ERR> buy some goods for the Spring Festival before the Spring Festival and name them New Year goods.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-4]> In </ERR> the New Year's Eve, every family must have the New Year supper the whole family.But <ERR type=[pr3,-1]> this </ERR> years many families like to have New Year supper in restaurants.
In the flower <ERR type=[fm1,-]> market </ERR> people always like to by some chrysanthemum blossoms, peach blossoms and some basins of gold orange.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> and </ERR> with the day passed, then the spring festival is over.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> During </ERR> the way home, we talked while we <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rided </ERR> bicycle.
[fm1,-] Before long I got to my home and have to say goodbye to them.
Of course, white board is good for people's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> healf </ERR> , but like every new thing always has shortcomings.
Through I am sure about the new thing ----white board has good <ERR type=[np7,2-]> future </ERR> without limit.
There <ERR type=[vp3,1-4]> was </ERR> just a few people in the street and there were few cars were seen once in a while.
[,9-0] Four students let out of school ago.
Now they were going home by bike side by side in the street by <ERR type=[wd5,9-0]> bike </ERR> .
Now motorcycle is forbad many great <ERR type=[fm2,-]> cities </ERR> in the world.
Red <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> make </ERR> people warm.
During revolution's <ERR type=[wd7,2-0]> revolution </ERR> , red <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> mean </ERR> new life.People like red.
The preliminary of the singers match in our school was <ERR type=[fm2,-]> holded </ERR> this afternoon.
Three classmates finished singing, en it's turn to <ERR type=[wd7,4-0]> me </ERR> .
I sang the song only the high <ERR type=[cc1,-]> tide </ERR> part.
I thought that I could enter the final after <ERR type=[vp5,1-1]> finished </ERR> singing.
Though I know the final is nothing with me, I glad to join in the <ERR type=[,7-0]> match, </ERR> because it gave me a chance to practise.
Today I took part in the finals of the <ERR type=[cc1,-1]> singers </ERR> match because of the extra number.
The finals <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> include </ERR> three parts: introduce my self, singing a song which you select, singing a song without accompanying in some parts.
Though my head teacher <ERR type=[vp4,-]> had </ERR> gave me some <ERR type=[np6,-]> advices </ERR> ,I feel I sang in the finals not better than in the preliminary, perhaps I felt critical in that time.
But to my surprise, I <ERR type=[wd2,-]> successed </ERR> finally.
I became one of the "ten <ERR type=[fm1,-]> reat </ERR> singers" in our school instead of extra number.
This week we had lessons in the chemical lab because <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> the </ERR> Grade Three had modern examination in our classroom from Tuesday to this weekend.
Because when we were having a lesson, the students who in the other class were <ERR type=[vp6,-]> play </ERR> sport's game out of the lab.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Sudently </ERR> you would <ERR type=[vp6,5-20]> heard </ERR> a great <ERR type=[fm1,-]> noice </ERR> from the top of the lab, that is a football <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hited </ERR> the top of the lab <ERR type=[cc5,6-]> weightly </ERR> .
The finals <ERR type=[vp3,2-7]> was </ERR> between our Chinese team and French team.
The points after the first two <ERR type=[fm1,-]> measare </ERR> words was 1:1.
So the third <ERR type=[fm1,-]> measare </ERR> word was very important.
In the third <ERR type=[fm1,-]> measare </ERR> word who is Wang tao our team's main forces won the first plate and took the lead in the second plate.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Sof </ERR> when I got to our classroom .
Then Miss Lin asked us to <ERR type=[vp5,3-1]> went </ERR> back.
Many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gradustors </ERR> from it have become famous <ERR type=[,7-0]> men </ERR> .
Now the school has thirty-six classes and there are one thousand and eight hundred <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stydents </ERR> and two hundred teachers study or work in it.
And there're two teaching <ERR type=[np6,-]> building </ERR> , one laboratory building and one big playground in it.

Banana and his neighbour helped the fire <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> man </ERR> to try to put out the ire.
At last, the fire <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> is </ERR> out.
No body <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> is </ERR> hurt and killed.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> he </ERR> studied at <ERR type=[fm1,-]> elin </ERR> University and lived in Germany, France, UK, and Belgium.

This time the problem was shown, it struck the <ERR type=[cc1,-1]> warning </ERR> clock for me.
Now I am at the crossroads, if I went along this road, I must fail one day, if I take a correct attitude forwards study, I still have a <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> big </ERR> hope.
It is not too late to mend the <ERR type=[wd7,1-0]> fold </ERR> even after some of the <ERR type=[wd3,5-3]> sleep </ERR> have been lost.
I still <ERR type=[vp6,2-0]> believed </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sb's </ERR> argument <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> is </ERR> hold water deeply, but at the some time I admitted my manner and some sentences in my articles are so extreme and excessive that they will make <ERR type=[cc4,-]> sick </ERR> effect and hurt somebody.
I know my view is too sharp, but I don't think my thesis is wrong in some <ERR type=[wd3,-]> question </ERR> .
All the world are in <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> contradictory.
At first, I couldn't <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> grasp </ERR> the spirit <ERR type=[pp1,-]> on </ERR> how to <ERR type=[cc3,2-3]> go </ERR> over my knowledge, so I was <ERR type=[wd3,-]> pulled </ERR> by them.
As time went on, I started to <ERR type=[cc3,3-2]> master </ERR> some ideas and I felt I was going into the state.
There are about two months that we take up our gauntlet : for a diligent student, the spare time was so full, but for a lazy one, it was little, which one I changed, it's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> depent </ERR> by me.

After I have <ERR type=[vp1,3-0]> done </ERR> , I died by myself.
If I was the boy, I didn't force the nobleman to draw upon <ERR type=[wd7,13-0]> me </ERR> .
On the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contory </ERR> , I will make friends with that nobleman, and I will find a chance to take my sister leave the noleman's house.

For example, their friends, their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> studing </ERR> , their work ...
When the sport meeting <ERR type=[vp4,-]> coming </ERR> , they borrowed the skirts for us to wear; they brought some for us to say "win".
<ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> On </ERR> the class, they talked well.
Miss Lin and Mr Yang were so <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> kindness </ERR> .
We sent two <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> present </ERR> or them.
On this, I hoped they <ERR type=[vp6,3-5]> will </ERR> have a good <ERR type=[wd3,-]> living </ERR> forever.
I liked it very much because I wanted to improve <ERR type=[pr3,4-2]> our </ERR> English level.

I wish our class's progress would succeed <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> in </ERR> the Article Day.
Though the holiday is short, the teachers <ERR type=[vp6,7-7]> gave </ERR> us <ERR type=[np8,0-1]> many </ERR> homework to do.
We <ERR type=[vp9,1-3]> should </ERR> did more best in our <ERR type=[np5,-]> homeworks </ERR> , went over our lessons in his holiday.
Because next term we will have the five subject exam .And the next year, we will meet the exam of pass the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Guang </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Dong </ERR>

In the spring Festival, everyone in China will clean <ERR type=[pr3,5-1]> their </ERR> house, change the old things, buy some new shirts, some cakes for the spring Festival, buy some flowers.
On the last day of last year, everyone would go to <ERR type=[pr3,4-2]> their </ERR> own home, all the families be in one chair and have a good meal.

<ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> On </ERR> one day, I went around it with my good friend.
And the interesting thing as: here are some little <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> shop </ERR> which sold the small thing in it.
They sold some puzzle, some <ERR type=[wd4,5-2]> viles, </ERR> some beautiful bottles.
Wish all the people in our country were happy <ERR type=[,9-0]> too </ERR> .

Because the new <ERR type=[fm1,-1]> while </ERR> board is in great use for the teacher .
We don't be <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> used </ERR> of <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> looking </ERR> this.
I think after <ERR type=[fm1,-]> serval </ERR> days, we will write <ERR type=[wd4,3-5]> the </ERR> white board in large letters.
There are a classroom <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> buildings </ERR> , a lot of lab <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> building </ERR> and a library in it.
The school offers twelve courses, including <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> , English, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mathenatics </ERR> , physics, chemistry, biology, politics, music, art, P.E., computer, and English typing.
It's nice <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> school </ERR> and we all love it.
hey <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> Guang zhou is a very good place to make money.
The increasing population <ERR type=[cc5,-2]> made </ERR> rubbish increase.
Last night, I <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> had </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> seen </ERR> the newspaper.
And the important is must add the result of listening text up to the <ERR type=[,14-0]> NMET </ERR> .
When I heard this news, I began to decide a plan to train the listening.That is I will listen to the radio when I get up from go to <ERR type=[,7-0]> school </ERR> .
During this period, I will <ERR type=[vp2,0-4]> listen </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd3,6-3]> type </ERR> of the lesson.
Miss Lin, can you give good <ERR type=[fm1,-]> iders </ERR> to improve my listening except this?

<ERR type=[np4,0-1]> Mother </ERR> Day
The second Sunday in May is our's <ERR type=[np4,2-1]> mother </ERR> festival.
Every woman <ERR type=[pr5,2-8]> which </ERR> has a child on yesterday was very happy.
when she <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> laid </ERR> a child, she must take care of the baby.
When the baby grew, she had <ERR type=[vp5,1-5]> to </ERR> sent her child to school.
As a child, I <ERR type=[vp6,4-12]> wished </ERR> my mother <ERR type=[vp3,2-9]> have </ERR> a good time orever and have a good health!
Many students who were <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd4,4-4]> gratuated </ERR> have been famous people.
The playground, which we often play on <ERR type=[wd5,7-0]> it </ERR> , and have many exercises.
The teacher <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> teach </ERR> well.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> are strict with us.
My hometown My hometown lies in the south of Yang dong <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Couty </ERR> .
Some new houses and new schools have been <ERR type=[vp7,3-0]> build </ERR> .
The crop <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> have </ERR> been good.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> the agricultural production is going high.
My home town is very beautiful and the people in it <ERR type=[vp6,11-2]> were </ERR> very kind.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> temprature </ERR> is about 30c.
When I see this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scean </ERR> , I think about I often <ERR type=[vp6,5-3]> swim </ERR> in my childhood.
It will be <ERR type=[vp7,3-2]> lasted </ERR> two hours.
So they join every select beauty <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> match </ERR> .
If she wins he match, she will cry out : <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "oh </ERR> !
Though men have strong muscles, handsome looking, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ense </ERR> of humor and learned brain, they have to be audiences.
And this is why men must work hard at their <ERR type=[np5,2-0]> works </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> help </ERR> each other
Because of these, they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> havn't </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happness </ERR> like the ordinary persons.
If a man <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> have </ERR> hair, he won't want to be <ERR type=[wd7,12-0]> blunt </ERR> .
Let's help each <ERR type=[wd4,4-5]> other, </ERR> make the world full of warm.Boss Many people want to be a boss.
First, he must " throw away" their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> wifes </ERR> who help and stay with him when <ERR type=[pr3,16-3]> they </ERR> are in trouble.
It <ERR type=[fm1,-]> coundn't </ERR> show that they are bosses.
<ERR type=[pp2,-1]> At </ERR> less, you must know "OK", "Yes", "No", "Very good" and so on to show your "knowledge".
Because of rain, umbrella, shoes, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rainboots </ERR> and rain coat can be seen everywhere.
The shop which sell them <ERR type=[vp3,5-2]> has </ERR> <ERR type=[np8,0-1]> many </ERR> business.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> terrible </ERR> women
They haven't powerful <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mucle </ERR> , smooth teeth and lots of money.
If the women <ERR type=[wd3,3-4]> call </ERR> them to the west, men dare not go to the east; if the women all them to it, en dare not stand.
But it is interesting at the men like these <ERR type=[wd5,9-3]> are </ERR> always become rich after several years.
My New school My school is a key school which has a history of <ERR type=[wd7,11-0]> 0 </ERR> .
<ERR type=[np4,0-5]> Its </ERR> many graduates have become famous <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> person </ERR> .
school has two <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> teaching-building </ERR> , a <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> build </ERR> of experiment and a big <ERR type=[cc4,-]> play </ERR> ground.
Now, students are doing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> excesics </ERR> on the play ground.
When I got to the shop, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "oh </ERR> !
I remember that when I was a <ERR type=[,7-0]> child </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ofter </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> go </ERR> swimming.
I think that June is one of the best <ERR type=[np6,4-3]> month </ERR> in a year.
Time <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> pass </ERR> fast.
It is because I haven't firmly <ERR type=[cc3,3-2]> grasped </ERR> the time.
And this wasted me <ERR type=[np8,3-1]> many </ERR> time.
Beginning of the new term After a very short " inter holidays" which had only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> laten </ERR> for two weeks, having finished the homework which was so much that we must do it all through the holidays, we began to have the added <ERR type=[,36-0]> classes </ERR> .
This term seems to be a very busy <ERR type=[wd6,8-0]> term </ERR> .
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-8]> was </ERR> only two <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> week </ERR> since the new term began.
But we had <ERR type=[vp6,3-5]> paid </ERR> a large <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> number </ERR> of money.
At first we must hand in the money for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> registring </ERR> .
In this term it <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> raised </ERR> to almost 00 an.
The notice said that it was because the price of paper had en <ERR type=[vp7,7-0]> risen </ERR> .
How can the teachers take decisive action without asking for approval and only report it later as a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fait </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> accompli </ERR> !
How can they use our money that <ERR type=[vp3,7-3]> haven't </ERR> been handed over!
It was said that the reward of the added classes would be collected <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fore </ERR> long.
If it <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> go </ERR> on like this, we will go bankrupt sooner or <ERR type=[fm3,-]> later.the </ERR> whiteboards Now the teachers in our school needn't be <ERR type=[vp7,1-]> harm </ERR> by the dust of the chalk any more.
It is because that the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> blackboards </ERR> in our school was changed to whiteboards last week.
The students sitting the front of the classroom <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benefit </ERR> from it too.
After the whiteboard was <ERR type=[vp7,4-0]> use </ERR> , the air became cleaner than before, but after used some times , the white board becomes dirty.And the white board is hard to be dry.
This <ERR type=[vp3,1-5]> prevent </ERR> us from writing on it.
<ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> On </ERR> last Thursday, when we were having a chemistry class, <ERR type=[wd7,0-6]> dust </ERR> was burned on the play ground.
The smell <ERR type=[vp6,2-2]> make </ERR> us uncomfortable.
The smell of the lavatory was <ERR type=[vp7,-]> bring </ERR> to us.
This Thursday we were told that there would be running <ERR type=[wd3,> surrounding </ERR> 1- 4] the Jin hua street <ERR type=[wd5,0-3]> on </ERR> the ext day, so we had to come to school at 7:10.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> In </ERR> Friday morning, it rained very hard.
I thought that the running must be given up, so I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wnet </ERR> to school at the time we <ERR type=[vp6,8-6]> have </ERR> the morning reading on ordinary days.
After having run several hundred mertres , the rain became harder and harder, so that we can <ERR type=[vp6,9-1]> stop </ERR> running.
Now we have <ERR type=[np7,1-]> little </ERR> thing of entertainment to do in our room.
It <ERR type=[wd3,-]> lies </ERR> in our head teacher.
In these days, we had <ERR type=[vp6,5-4]> been </ERR> forbidden to play football unless it was <ERR type=[wd3,0-4]> on </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phsiclal </ERR> training class, forbidden to play the Five Pieces Chess, even forbidden to play the Chinese Chess .
Though it seemed very silly, we thought it fairly interesting in the games we <ERR type=[vp6,9-0]> can </ERR> play.
Everyday, as soon as the class is over, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> serval </ERR> groups of classmates get together and play <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Flying </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Chess </ERR> .
This <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> make </ERR> me think that the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Flying </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Chess </ERR> will be forbidden to play sooner or later.
The first part was the problems essential to be <ERR type=[vp7,4-0]> answer </ERR> .
Every group must pick out five of the problems and answer <ERR type=[pr3,8-0]> it </ERR> .
The second part was the problems to try to be the first to <ERR type=[,13-0]> answer </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> every </ERR> subject made full use of all the time to give classes and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> reveiv </ERR> .
Every day there would be some exercise papers handed out, such as Chinese, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> physece </ERR> , chemistry, English...., all the time had to be used to do the paper.
Last week <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> the </ERR> senior three were going to have the simulate examination.
So <ERR type=[wd5,0-2]> the </ERR> senior two had to lend them the classrooms and moved to the lab to have classes.
Having classes in the chemistry lab was very <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unconvenient </ERR> .
This would late to the morning <ERR type=[,6-0]> reading </ERR> .
It was very <ERR type=[wd3,-]> bad </ERR> for the teacher to get there to give us lessons.
They <ERR type=[vp9,1-2]> must </ERR> got down from the fifth floor long before the class began, and get back to the fifth floor after class.
The only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conveniet </ERR> thing was to play balls.
The experiment exams This Tuesday and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wedesday </ERR> there will be experiment exams of physics, biology and chemistry one after another.
This took us into the tide of <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> experiment </ERR> .
The physics lab and the biology lab opened for us to some <ERR type=[wd2,8-0]> practice </ERR> these days.
This <ERR type=[fm1,-]> brough </ERR> us much <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffculty </ERR> in doing experiment.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> He </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mot </ERR> trouble thing was to see the video recording of physics experiment.
It would <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> be </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> showed </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> at </ERR> last Tuesday night.
his made the students didn't need to go to school at night stayed at <ERR type=[,14-0]> school </ERR> .
But at that night, after waiting for more than half an hour in the basement, we were told that the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> videocorder </ERR> didn't work.
My school <ERR type=[vp6,2-3]> was </ERR> a key school with a history of seventy years.
The school has thirty <ERR type=[fm2,-]> six </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> class </ERR> .
In the school, there are two <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> building </ERR> for teaching, one building for experiment and a large play ground.
Playing Basketball Since the <ERR type=[cc1,1-1]> basketball </ERR> court was built in our school, the tide of playing basketball came into being in our class.
But the tide <ERR type=[vp3,3-4]> last </ERR> to the night now.
Today was very hot, the air temperature was nearly <ERR type=[wd4,-]> thirty </ERR> centigrade.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> most </ERR> of them swam well.
A little girl was <ERR type=[wd3,> studying </ERR> 0- 1] swimming, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> teached </ERR> by her mother.
Since then, I had never <ERR type=[vp6,5-2]> had </ERR> a swim.
I regarded June as one of the best <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> month </ERR> in a year.
Time is <ERR type=[cc2,2-1]> leaving </ERR> quickly.
Because my English is not so <ERR type=[ad2,5-0]> well </ERR> , speaking is worse than writing.
I will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> sorry for this.
I thought: in act, I am afraid of you for I <ERR type=[vp3,7-2]> doesn't </ERR> believe myself.
If I try my best, nobody <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> laugh </ERR> at me and they are friendly to me.
Don't let my teacher and parents <ERR type=[fm1,-]> desappoint </ERR> .
Have any <ERR type=[,2-0]> else </ERR> ?
Yes, it is sports.I often <ERR type=[vp6,2-12]> didn't </ERR> get up until 10 o'clock when I needn't go to school ago.
Through father's words, I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> knowed </ERR> it wasted time for I got up late.
I must get up early and <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> have </ERR> some sports.
It's helpful <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> for </ERR> me.
I thought it <ERR type=[vp6,3-9]> is </ERR> pleasant o breathe the fresh air in the morning.
There were green <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> tree </ERR> , green grassland, the orange sun, little birds and the happy people in it.
Ever since then, I <ERR type=[vp6,-]> insist </ERR> to get up early and <ERR type=[cc3,-]> have </ERR> sports.
A very unhappy thing was <ERR type=[vp7,5-3]> happened </ERR> in this week--- my little tortoise is dead.
Then I liked "my friend" than before because he was the last one and I <ERR type=[ad2,1-9]> very </ERR> regard that I hadn't taken good care of them.
But I couldn't change the thing, the little <ERR type=[wd4,-]> tortoise </ERR> still as died .
But I hope dear tortoise can find his friends and become <ERR type=[wd2,10-0]> happiely </ERR> .
That was Guang zhou if it can be elected a health city of <ERR type=[,13-0]> country </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> people </ERR> worked as one and tried hard to make Guang Zhou cleaning.
But when I saw my Dad and Mum <ERR type=[vp5,7-1]> worked </ERR> carefully, I couldn't <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> free </ERR> my hands.
When I was cleaning, Mum said to me: " Should we take a <ERR type=[wd7,-]> watch </ERR> for cleaning the windows quickly?
<ERR type=[pr2,0-4]> It's </ERR> sure I will win.
I did the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> word </ERR> carefully than before.
I hope The flower city can be <ERR type=[vp7,7-3]> got </ERR> cleaning than before.
Today we had the sports meeting at the <ERR type=[np4,2-1]> Worker </ERR> Stadium.
Today is happy and <ERR type=[cc4,4-0]> exciting </ERR> .
In this, my class has already <ERR type=[wd7,6-0]> lead </ERR> .
It was <ERR type=[vp7,2-4]> made </ERR> my class very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> extraordimary </ERR> .
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> oh </ERR> , we have <ERR type=[vp6,2-0]> win </ERR> , it's very good.
" Hold class said <ERR type=[wd7,3-0]> together </ERR> .
After this, there were some classmates win a <ERR type=[,6-0]> prize </ERR> .
How exciting was <ERR type=[wd1,3-0]> it </ERR> !We can see and feel our classmates love our class and school through this sports meeting.
It was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> intructive </ERR> for us.
In that time, how I can...if I can catch up with other classmates in a short time, I must study <ERR type=[ad3,s-]> hard </ERR> than before and give up bad habits.
What <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> is </ERR> my bad habits?
I try to give up <ERR type=[wd1,5-0]> it </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> are planted by my dad.
After water the flowers, some drop of water slide follow the <ERR type=[,11-0]> flowers </ERR> .
And looks like to say " Good morning" to <ERR type=[,8-0]> you </ERR> .
When you breathe the fresh air look at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy is <ERR type=[wd1,3-0]> it </ERR> !The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me <ERR type=[cc4,-]> much </ERR> knowledge about plants.
The feeling was very interesting and <ERR type=[cc4,6-0]> intructive </ERR> .
Worried, because the military training was very tired, I afraid of this as tired as the military <ERR type=[,17-0]> training </ERR> .
When we reached the base, and began to work, I found to become a farmer was <ERR type=[aj4,7-0]> tired </ERR> .
But there was happy in <ERR type=[,5-0]> it </ERR> .
Through this farmer's work, I <ERR type=[cc3,0-4]> learned </ERR> a lot of knowledge.
On Friday afternoon, our class had a meeting for <ERR type=[vp5,6-4]> choose </ERR> the monitor and cadres.
It can be <ERR type=[vp7,3-2]> shown </ERR> our ideas.
We can choose the monitor and cadres who we all like <ERR type=[wd5,8-1]> the </ERR> best.
It can be <ERR type=[vp7,3-6]> given </ERR> all the classmates a fair chance.
All the people believed <ERR type=[pr4,4-4]> her </ERR> can accept this work.
She was very happy.I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> verry </ERR> happy for her, too.
I believed it was very <ERR type=[aj4,5-4]> bored </ERR> before I saw it.
The film was exciting and moving and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> angering </ERR> .
When I saw the Chinese severely <ERR type=[vp5,6-2]> scolded </ERR> the Japanese, I was <ERR type=[aj4,2-0]> exciting </ERR> ;when I saw : the Chinese common people left their home and <ERR type=[vp6,8-2]> become </ERR> a fugitive; the children left their parents, no food, no clothes, cried on the street; the old person saw their lands became ruins and cried bitterly, I was very <ERR type=[aj4,3-0]> moving </ERR> .
When I saw : the Japanese named himself " the king of the Heaven", they made trouble out of nothing, tried to <ERR type=[wd2,-]> agression </ERR> China and <ERR type=[wd2,-]> impudented </ERR> to make China pay for the war reparations, I <ERR type=[wd2,-]> angered </ERR> very much.
In the end, we united and <ERR type=[vp4,-1]> be </ERR> winner.
I must place the <ERR type=[np6,4-6]> interest </ERR> of the country above everything else.
Then the <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> base </ERR> is very bad.
In the junior middle school, I was absent-minded to have the lessons of <ERR type=[,15-0]> geography </ERR> .
At that time, geography wasn't diffucult, I depended on my memory to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> have </ERR> tests.
And often passed <ERR type=[,3-0]> them </ERR> .
But in the senior middle school now, understanding is very important to learn geography, so I want to get good grades is <ERR type=[,22-0]> impossible </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> known </ERR> my <ERR type=[wd3,5-2]> base </ERR> was bad, this was fact.
Now I believe it isn't very difficult <ERR type=[vp5,7-3]> be </ERR> learn geography better.
The Emperor's new clothes Long <ERR type=[wd6,-]> long </ERR> age there <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> loved </ERR> an emperor, he cared more for the beautiful clothes <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thatn </ERR> for anything else.
The cheat knew the emperor liked fine few clothes, then they came to tell the emperor that they were the best <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> weaver </ERR> and they can <ERR type=[vp6,2-17]> weave </ERR> a kind of cloth which the people of stupid or unfit for their office could not see.
The official could not see anything, but his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> anwer </ERR> was as same as the Prime Minister .
The emperor walked in the street and <ERR type=[vp6,7-3]> have </ERR> the "new clothes".
Many people <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> pretend </ERR> to see the clothes, but suddenly a little child said: " He has nothing on!
The Emperor heard the cries and he knew that the people's words were true, but he went on the procession to <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> keep </ERR> his face.
Example: we <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> won </ERR> first place on the programme of flowers.
These was <ERR type=[np7,0-2]> a </ERR> exciting news for us.
It also greatly <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> encourage </ERR> us.
They didn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mine </ERR> if they couldn't win the prize.
Then everyone rehearsed again and again, no one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mined </ERR> tired and hard.
as a NO.4 Middle School's student, we were proud of our art programme had so high <ERR type=[,17-0]> level </ERR> .
But all the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> thinks </ERR> could not <ERR type=[cc2,6-9]> leave </ERR> teachers and students' hard exercise and the others' support.
Example: In my class, Ao Jingya, Tao Xin, Chen Xiaocong, Ye Jiaqing, Li Yongming and Lui Siming made sixty-one <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> card </ERR> on which there <ERR type=[wd7,10-0]> were-and </ERR> ---.
Today on the art programme, when Liang Shaoying was singing, all the class Two's students put up our these --- and ---, and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> shaked </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,24-0]> them </ERR> .
At this time, we <ERR type=[vp7,4-1]> moved </ERR> deeply, I thought Liang Shao ying was, too.
And she is impatient, then she <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> hates </ERR> slow very much, and she does what she ays at once.
I am <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> different </ERR> for her, no ways, I am often taught by her.
She <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> grow </ERR> old and querulous.
Example: Sometimes I got up late, she <ERR type=[vp9,1-3]> must </ERR> :" Dan, <ERR type=[cc5,1-1]> be </ERR> quickly!
<ERR type=[cc5,0-1]> be </ERR> quickly!
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> now </ERR> is 7:30!
" " <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ah </ERR> ,7:30?
When I dress, her voice is said again: " Dan, <ERR type=[cc5,0-1]> be </ERR> quickly!
You <ERR type=[vp9,1-3]> will </ERR> late for school if you don't hurry.
" " <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ok </ERR> !
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> she sometimes so trouble , <ERR type=[wd5,9-8]> but </ERR> I know she loves me, loves our family.
The Twentieth Week The End of The Emperor's New Clothes In my hildhood, I have <ERR type=[vp6,5-2]> read </ERR> this story.
But my idea <ERR type=[wd3,-]> for </ERR> it is <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> different </ERR> that time.
When I was only a little girl, I ought the honest boy was very kind, and he was as young as me, so I <ERR type=[ad2,1-2]> very </ERR> liked <ERR type=[fm1,-]> himm </ERR> I believed the emperor went back his palace,he knew himself was worng and regreted m2,-] .
So my idea for this story has been <ERR type=[vp7,7-0]> changed </ERR> .
Now I believe the emperor wanted to <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> keep </ERR> his face and held his head higher, then he couldn't see the road.
Because he had nothing on really, <ERR type=[wd5,6-5]> so </ERR> the stone cut his skin.
Sham was punish <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> him </ERR> .
Though he tried his est to <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> keep </ERR> his face, <ERR type=[wd5,9-4]> but </ERR> at last he couldn't.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> perhaps </ERR> after many years, my idea will change.
Because the story ells us: Fact must hit down <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sham </ERR> .
When I got there, I saw my little sister whom I haven't <ERR type=[vp6,8-3]> seen </ERR> so long <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> time </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,0-5]> How </ERR> a little and lively girl!
When I saw her to <ERR type=[vp5,5-2]> play </ERR> a toy, I <ERR type=[vp2,1-5]> thought </ERR> my childhood, and my toys.
Though I didn't have so many at that time, I still played so <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> happy </ERR> .
At that time, I usually stayed at home with Dad and Mum in the evening that I couldn't play <ERR type=[wd4,-]> with </ERR> friends.
So I like the night of power <ERR type=[wd3,7-0]> cut </ERR> .
" and "TT1/4"... <ERR type=[wd3,0-3]> How </ERR> a happy night!
I <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> needn't </ERR> worried, needn't do home work ... Now, my childhood <ERR type=[vp7,2-1]> was </ERR> passed.
I doesn't <ERR type=[vp3,2-0]> like </ERR> the night of power <ERR type=[wd7,9-0]> cut </ERR> , because I must go over the homework.My little friends are the same as me, they must study.
.. but I <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> doesn't </ERR> feel unhappy.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-11]> But </ERR> a person in the world, he can't always take from others, he ought to give to others and his country.
If I do it, I must study hard now, though I can't play as before, I still <ERR type=[,2-0]> happy </ERR> , because I study for my duty.
Xuan Yun sheng and me <ERR type=[vp3,5-5]> is </ERR> a pair of good friends.
Though some years <ERR type=[vp7,3-1]> were </ERR> passed, our friendship didn't change.
The feeling <ERR type=[pr5,2-8]> what </ERR> she gives me is very <ERR type=[cc4,8-]> kind </ERR> and clever.
She tells me her nose likes her <ERR type=[wd7,7-0]> Dad </ERR> .
Her hair is often plaited on <ERR type=[wd4,-]> the </ERR> , I believe this fits her.
" Xuan Yun sheng likes smiling, sports, reading, listening to the songs, watching TV, sleeping (she often <ERR type=[vp3,2-2]> say </ERR> to me: " Brother, I really want to go to bed!
I will <ERR type=[vp1,2-1]> care </ERR> her and study her.
The Third Week What matter is paid attention to the most recently is President is elected in <ERR type=[,14-0]> Taiwan </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Through </ERR> I'm a student, I still know Li Denghui is a schemer.
Out country even doesn't afraid of America and Japan, of course, we don't afraid of <ERR type=[,15-0]> him </ERR> .
This likes a man begs others to hit his <ERR type=[,9-0]> brother </ERR> .
I have still remebered: Four years ago, when Li Denghui was elected President the first, he told all the people that he would try to help to unite China and Tai <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Wan </ERR> .
But now, his deeds is different,what he <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> have </ERR> ever said "completely, What a big lie!
" <ERR type=[fm1-]> through </ERR> Li Deng hui is elected President, the fact hasn't changed, China must be unite!
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Footh </ERR> Week
In fact, I <ERR type=[vp6,3-7]> had </ERR> liked it when I was a pupil.At that time, I often played with my classmates, and even with mum.
I have <ERR type=[vp6,2-10]> taken </ERR> part in the match of kicking shuttlecock in my school.
When I went into the middle school, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> studing </ERR> was ore difficult than before, and the homework was more and more.
Then after a long ime, I didn't grasp how to kick the <ERR type=[cc6,-1]> shuttlecock </ERR> nearly.
But when I studied in the senior school, I found the boys of my class <ERR type=[vp6,7-4]> are </ERR> good at icking shuttlecock.
When I see they kick so <ERR type=[wd2,6-0]> happy </ERR> , I can't help rying.
The girls in my class look like shy very much, but when they are playing, they won't <ERR type=[wd1,2-0]> shy </ERR> .
<ERR type=[vp4,0-10]> Kick </ERR> shuttlecock after the class was ver is a good thing.
When I make it, I think the struggle of Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> on 12.
A lot of soldiers lost their lives for our country and people on that <ERR type=[fm3,-]> day.how </ERR> great they are!
As the person of Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> , I must remember this history.Our happy living is changed by the great soldiers' flesh and blood.
We must care our happy <ERR type=[wd3,-]> living </ERR> .
When he <ERR type=[vp2,2-2]> thought </ERR> the footmark, he was afraid to go out, even for food.
He hurried out to hit a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strick </ERR> .
Then Crusoe made up his mind to <ERR type=[wd3,-]> shout </ERR> the savages if they came again.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> are planted by my dad.
When you go into <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> in </ERR> early morning, you will feel the air is very fresh.
After watering the flowers , some drops of water slide follow the <ERR type=[,7-0]> flowers </ERR> .
That is <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> beautiful </ERR> very much.
When you breathe the flesh air, look at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy <ERR type=[pr3,19-1]> it </ERR> is!
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> William Tell walked past the pole without bowing.
So his son and he were <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> caught </ERR> to the governor Gessler.
He ordered Tell <ERR type=[vp5,3-2]> shoot </ERR> at the apple which was on his son's head.
Without saying a word, William Tell drew two arrows and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> splited </ERR> the apple in half with one arrow.
If the arrow <ERR type=[vp8,3-5]> shoot </ERR> at him,he wouldn't bow.
Facing the emperor, William Tell and his son were calm and brave.Their <ERR type=[cc2,1-5]> courage </ERR> quickly got round througout Switzerland.
The Swiss <ERR type=[vp7,2-1]> were </ERR> encourage, they rose up and forced the Austrain soldiers to go from Switzerland.
It <ERR type=[vp7,1-7]> said </ERR> that she went to foreign country later, so I haven't seen her for a long time.
She was from the north of China, but she could speak the language of Guang <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> Zhou </ERR> very much.
She taught Chinese, and the classes which she <ERR type=[cc3,4-3]> gave </ERR> were not interesting.
Then she let me stay in classroom after school <ERR type=[wd5,2-0]> over </ERR> .
I was first <ERR type=[vp7,3-0]> punish </ERR> , I will remember forever.
But the sun has <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rised </ERR> up.
I didn't <ERR type=[vp6,2-0]> went </ERR> to sleep again.
Then I got up and <ERR type=[vp6,5-4]> go </ERR> out of the balcony.
In front of the building which I <ERR type=[wd4,7-4]> live </ERR> is a big tree.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> I didn't see one, I heard the voice that the birds was <ERR type=[cc3,8-0]> singing </ERR> .
The wind <ERR type=[fm2,-]> blowed </ERR> at me, oh!
Because I usually go to school, <ERR type=[wd5,6-7]> so </ERR> I seldom feel such a good morning.
Then I must <ERR type=[vp1,2-4]> thank </ERR> for the summer holiday!
The sun <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> rise </ERR> up higher and higher.
The street <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> was </ERR> became busy.
A new start----Let us <ERR type=[wd3,-]> care </ERR> it together!
My grandpa is <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> eight </ERR> three years old.
He is <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> thin </ERR> very much.
If someone <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> don't </ERR> know my grandpa's ge, <ERR type=[pr3,8-9]> they </ERR> can't guess that he is such an old man.
My grandpa often <ERR type=[vp3,3-0]> smile </ERR> , especially when we go to see him.
He often tells me some great men, the custom of some places and <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> the </ERR> other interesting things.
My grandpa <ERR type=[vp2,2-4]> care </ERR> my studying very much.
He said to me: " The important thing is that you really <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> grasp </ERR> the knowledge.
But when I was in my childhood, I wasn't clear what <ERR type=[wd1,4-2]> was </ERR> my ideal.
In my heart, the good thing was too <ERR type=[np8,4-0]> much </ERR> , I didn't know what was the best.
when I saw a doctor, I thought that doctor could save many lives, so I wanted to be <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> doctor </ERR> .
As a judge, she can defend the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> fairness </ERR> .
Ideal mustn't be <ERR type=[wd7,-]> great </ERR> .
Their birthday is <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> in </ERR> the same day.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> grandpa is just <ERR type=[wd3,-]> elder </ERR> than my grandma <ERR type=[pp1,-]> for </ERR> ten years.
Today all my uncles, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> antys </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,7-5]> , </ERR> cousins went to my grandpa's home.
They were happy, but the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> best </ERR> were my grandpa and my grandma.
Looking at the children of <ERR type=[wd4,5-0]> own </ERR> , weren't they happy?
I felt sorry <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> to </ERR> them.
They missed me very much, and often asked my mother how I live and <ERR type=[vp6,8-0]> study </ERR> .
" I answered with my heart, full of <ERR type=[wd3,-]> moving </ERR> .
Though my grandpa and grandma didn't <ERR type=[cc3,2-4]> have </ERR> a lot of knowledge, though they can't give me some advice on the studying,they have helped p6,21-0] me --- give me support.
I hope you <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> get </ERR> a good health forever!
I don't want to <ERR type=[ad1,4-11]> only </ERR> do the homework at home or go to bed all day, so I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ceide </ERR> to do the sport in the morning.
This morning I went to stadium <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shich </ERR> is near my house with my friends <ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> in </ERR> 6:45.
Though it was early, many people have <ERR type=[vp6,7-4]> come </ERR> here to do exercise.
<ERR type=[vp6,0-8]> Running </ERR> 800 metres, we played a game of badminton.
But after some time, we played so <ERR type=[ad2,3-0]> good </ERR> and we were <ERR type=[aj4,2-2]> exciting </ERR> very much.
Perhaps we didn't for what , only for our happy feeling.A altogether, everything <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> were </ERR> beautiful and everything <ERR type=[vp3,1-0]> make </ERR> us happy.
What a <ERR type=[cc4,2-3]> happy </ERR> sport it was!
We love the sport, the morning and our <ERR type=[wd3,8-0]> living </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> the things are small, they can give strength to a person who is in trouble.
I still remember it happened <ERR type=[pp1,-]> in </ERR> last two years: One day I had a high fever <ERR type=[ad1,5-3]> suddenly </ERR> in the school.
I hadn't a little strength to do <ERR type=[pr6,7-0]> everything </ERR> , and I almost <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> lay </ERR> down.
We have not had supper, and I felt <ERR type=[vp6,8-0]> terrible </ERR> .
" Looking at her, I knew that she was <ERR type=[vp7,2-2]> tried </ERR> very much, the same as me.
In this week, all the students of our class were busy <ERR type=[wd3,8-4]> for </ERR> preparing the sports meeting.
Who were busy the most were the seventeen boys and <ERR type=[,10-0]> girls </ERR> .
They <ERR type=[fm1,-]> epresented </ERR> our class to 3?3?.
These girls and boys took <ERR type=[cc3,-]> care </ERR> 3of this chance very much.
after the school <ERR type=[wd5,3-0]> over </ERR> , in the evening studing of our own, they <ERR type=[wd2,1-3]> practiced </ERR> on the playground.
And they <ERR type=[fm2,-]> buyed </ERR> the shirts themselves in order that they can <ERR type=[vp6,13-3]> wear </ERR> the same clothes to 3?3?.
All the students of our class must <ERR type=[vp1,7-2]> thank </ERR> of them.
I <ERR type=[vp6,1-7]> read </ERR> a story about loving our homeland recently: During the course of the war of rising <ERR type=[wd7,10-0]> up </ERR> the Japanese.
Ji Hong chang (1/4ao* ) has been <ERR type=[vp6,5-3]> asked </ERR> to visit America by the1* * 3.
Then some <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> felt themselves inferior (?
When the postmaster knew that they were <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> ,he sneered: "China?
Ha ha..." Ji Hong chang's friend felt him inferior and said to him: " Why did you <ERR type=[vp6,3-4]> said </ERR> you were a Chinese?
He <ERR type=[fm2,-]> catched </ERR> his friend's shirt and shouted: " Don't you think it is a disgrace as a Chinese?
But I think it is a <ERR type=[wd2,5-7]> proud </ERR> that I am a Chinese.
Our two new teachers are so young, and they are <ERR type=[cc6,-2]> nice </ERR> very much.
But I know: though we <ERR type=[ad1,1-5]> maybe </ERR> will not meet each other, I will remember them and the time that we <ERR type=[wd3,8-2]> stayed </ERR> together forever.
We saw two men <ERR type=[wd3,4-0]> fright </ERR> .
The reason why they fought was a man <ERR type=[vp2,2-3]> knocked </ERR> the other's shoulder.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> only </ERR> for this, they quarreled at first, then they didn't give in, at last they fought.
I like sports, all kinds of sports are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> insteresting </ERR> to me.
his is one of the reasons <ERR type=[pr5,6-3]> which </ERR> I like swimming.
The other is that my mum told me swimming <ERR type=[vp6,6-5]> can </ERR> make us stronger and taller.
[vp9,3-] I not only like to play table tennis but also watch table tennis match.
It gives <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> me </ERR> relaxation.
I like <ERR type=[wd5,2-2]> the </ERR> other sports, for example: basketball, football, volleyball and o on, they all can keep us healthy.
I <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> agree </ERR> her words.
And eating is a good <ERR type=[wd7,5-3]> was </ERR> for me, too.
This <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> is often useful, <ERR type=[wd4,0-8]> except </ERR> sometimes I can't manage the matter at all.
Sleeping and eating are the good <ERR type=[wd7,6-15]> was </ERR> for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forgeting </ERR> the unhappy things, but the best was is trying to make myself happy, not <ERR type=[wd2,-]> angrying </ERR> for a small thing.
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS <ERR type=[fm1,-]> INVERNTION </ERR> .
And he was going to give his invention to the two men from the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goverment </ERR> , in order that everyone would be able to benefit from it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> two impostors shut the two men from the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goverment </ERR> and came to the professor's house to take away the invention.
They <ERR type=[vp1,1-2]> pretended </ERR> very well, and they believed that nobody could recognize them.
They thought that they had been <ERR type=[wd2,6-0]> success </ERR> !
But the old professor was more <ERR type=[aj3,1-0]> clever </ERR> than the two impostors.
Now I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unstand </ERR> that the health is the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> base </ERR> of studying or working.
I has <ERR type=[fm2,-]> planed </ERR> where I <ERR type=[vp6,7-10]> would </ERR> go to play with my friends and how I spent every day.
I enjoyed myself when I <ERR type=[vp2,2-1]> thought </ERR> this, even in the exam.
In <ERR type=[np2,1-0]> facts </ERR> , they gave me much <ERR type=[wd2,4-0]> interesting </ERR> :when I saw the windows that were washed, I felt so happy.
Today, I read an interesting story, it was <ERR type=[wd5,-]> talked </ERR> about: A young man had a new girl friend.
When the young man saw how much he had to pay, his face <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> turned </ERR> white as a paper.
To children, the most <ERR type=[aj3,2-0]> happy </ERR> day in a year is the Spring Festival.
In my childhood, I wondered why the Spring Festival was so special and all the people were different as <ERR type=[wd7,-]> usual </ERR> .
Now I am sixteen, not <ERR type=[wd5,-]> as </ERR> a little girl.
When I grow up, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unstand </ERR> my father is strict with me.
Perhaps he thinks I am not a child and I can <ERR type=[fm1-][cc3,2-2]> unstand </ERR> many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thinks </ERR> ,he talks with me more than before.
In fact, my father <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> like </ERR> smiling.
Sometimes he <ERR type=[wd3,-]> says </ERR> the joke to us.
He <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> like </ERR> writing poems.
Otherwise, my Chinese <ERR type=[ad1,2-4]> maybe </ERR> is very good now.
He is espected for this by my mother and <ERR type=[pr4,4-0]> I </ERR> .
But in my heart, he is great.But in his heart,what he beleives <ERR type=[,7-0]> me </ERR> ?
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-8]> was </ERR> our turn to be on duty this week.
it <ERR type=[vp6,1-3]> wasn't </ERR> the first time.
It was a hard and troublesome <ERR type=[np5,4-0]> work </ERR> .
I think that we needn't do the cleaning so <ERR type=[wd2,-]> tiresome </ERR> at that time.
But I haven't <ERR type=[wd3,2-5]> gone </ERR> to it for some time.
[vp6,-] The feeling which the nature gives for is <ERR type=[cc4,9-]> new </ERR> and happy.
I must wear a pair of <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> glass </ERR> when I have class.
I can't see the whiteboard so well without the <ERR type=[np6,9-0]> glass </ERR> .
I still didn't do the eye exercise, and still put my head low when I did my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> homewoek </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> must wear the <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> glass </ERR> , too.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-2]> In </ERR> Monday morning our headmaster will meet them and will introuduce our school' condition.
In the evening, we will take a party in the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> room </ERR> 402.
On <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wensday </ERR> we will have a meeting.
I was eager to grasp how to ride <ERR type=[np7,1-]> bike </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> I often got a heavy fall, I ill <ERR type=[vp6,8-3]> learn </ERR> by my heart.
One day, I first <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rided </ERR> the bike following my father on the street.
Who it <ERR type=[wd6,-]> it </ERR> ?
" "What's the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> matte </ERR> ?
"Oh, no <ERR type=[np1,1-]> matter </ERR> .
But since you want to talk with me, I will <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> give </ERR> some face to you.
We saw two men <ERR type=[wd3,4-0]> fright </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> only </ERR> for this, they quarrelled at first, then they didn't give in.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> last they fought.
" Oh..." I wondered: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> weren't </ERR> the two men foolish?
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Grangzhou </ERR> which is a beautiful modern city, there are some people like these.
And how I <ERR type=[wd2,-]> regretted </ERR> at that time!
Why not think it over before I did <ERR type=[fm3,-]> it?now </ERR> perhaps my mum has forgotten this thing.
I can't pardon myself <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> in </ERR> some time.
So I know what I can do is <ERR type=[vp6,8-3]> treat </ERR> my mother well.
I decide <ERR type=[vp5,2-5]> trying </ERR> my best to do it, and I will not make her sad any longer.
He <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lelf </ERR> us forever!
When I heard his bad news, my <ERR type=[cc2,-1]> heart </ERR> sang.
I remembered he had given a talk to us on a meeting about the problem two years <ERR type=[wd3,2-0]> before </ERR> .
When I came into the school, I felt the air was <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> special </ERR> fresh.
My school <ERR type=[vp6,2-0]> had </ERR> three high buildings.
Though my school <ERR type=[vp6,1-4]> had </ERR> thirty-six classes and <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> there </ERR> a wide playground .
It was very valuable for students to develop their <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> body </ERR> .
Seeing all the things, I could imagine how wonderful <ERR type=[wd1,5-7]> were </ERR> the following days which I would have.
It <ERR type=[vp7,1-12]> said </ERR> that there were many famous men and women graduating in my school.
<ERR type=[pr2,0-6]> That </ERR> is valuable for students to develop their bodies.
Now my school has thirty <ERR type=[fm2,-]> six </ERR> classes, one thousand eight <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hundred </ERR> students and two hundred teachers.
When you come into the gate of the People's Park, you may go down the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rode </ERR> which is near a small river.
So a few minutes later, you well <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> find </ERR> a bridge over the river.
When you reach the foot of the small hill, you should <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> turn </ERR> over the hill.
After doing that, you can see a small <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> woods </ERR> , then, we will <ERR type=[vp2,2-4]> wait </ERR> on you in it.
I still remember the last time <ERR type=[pr5,6-7]> that </ERR> I swam was about ten years ago.
He is one point seven three meters high and seventy <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> kilogram </ERR> .
He is fond of music and is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goot </ERR> at sports.
I think everyone in our class wants to improve <ERR type=[pr3,7-1]> your </ERR> lesson.
Now, I'll <ERR type=[cc3,1-5]> tell </ERR> you a piece of advice.
A piece of advice on how to improve <ERR type=[pr4,3-1]> you </ERR> lesson is "Make notes ".
" For example, in English class, <ERR type=[np6,0-2]> teacher </ERR> always writes some important things <ERR type=[wd3,4-1]> in </ERR> blackbord.
[np7,1-] We must "Take notes".
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-7]> was </ERR> a month since the new term began.
We clean the school every week, but I always <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> find </ERR> dirty in some place.
I think it must be <ERR type=[vp7,5-3]> make </ERR> by <ERR type=[np8,7-1]> few </ERR> students.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> must look on our school as our home, and make it clean.
Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou's </ERR> weather
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> beg </ERR> you to hear my explain.
I think everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-4]> have </ERR> the same <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> to </ERR> me.
But when some time had <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ted </ERR> ,the weather changed quickly.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> sun had hidden, just a moment, it was raining hard.
How <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disppointed </ERR> you are!
Perhaps the worst <ERR type=[fm1,-]> think </ERR> to you <ERR type=[wd4,-]> was </ERR> you forgot to take a raincoat.Ha Ha!
I'm sure you will think when you go out in Guang <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Zhou </ERR> in summer, the <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> worth </ERR> thing is to take a raincoat.
The NO.4 middle school's sport <ERR type=[cc2,6-2]> meeting </ERR> has <ERR type=[wd2,5-0]> past </ERR> .
At that time, he joined the running of 1500 <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> metre </ERR> .
The weather is hot and the sun is <ERR type=[vp6,8-0]> shining </ERR> .After 800 metre's running, he was so tired that he couldn't keep the high peed.
Suddenly he <ERR type=[wd3,2-4]> felt </ERR> down on the ground.
Finally he <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> raise </ERR> up and continued running.
Everyone claped <ERR type=[pr3,2-1]> their </ERR> hands.
However he was the last to the end, but he just <ERR type=[wd7,11-2]> like </ERR> the winner.
I like reading book, because it <ERR type=[cc3,6-3]> tells </ERR> me some knowledge and also <ERR type=[cc3,0-3]> tells </ERR> me some advice.
I like reading <ERR type=[np6,3-2]> book </ERR> about science.
The book just like windows, I can look <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> it and look around the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> would </ERR> .
It often gives me some advice on how to learn the object such as English, maths, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> ... Not only these but also it gives me advice on how to do good deed, how to help others.
From the book, I have <ERR type=[cc3,2-4][vp6,2-2]> learn </ERR> some knowledge.
Xiao jie <ERR type=[vp6,2-8]> is </ERR> my classmate when I was in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Primary </ERR> school.
We are <ERR type=[wd5,2-6]> the </ERR> good <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> friend </ERR> in school.
<ERR type=[cj1,0-2]> After </ERR> say "Hello", he told me is past and told me his new school, new friend, new thing.
I let him to my <ERR type=[,5-0]> home </ERR> and invited him to have dinner.
It is the first exam when we are in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Gread </ERR> Two.
Everyone will try his best to <ERR type=[cc3,6-3]> catch </ERR> a good mark.
so they are working hard <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> in </ERR> their lesson.
You can see them in some place, such as in the classroom and even <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> in </ERR> the road, they are doing some studying now.
After class, you can always see some of them still in the classroom, doing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exeicies </ERR> or quarreling <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> at </ERR> something.
When we reached Xie Chao Hill, we couldn't <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> held </ERR> crying.
we walked <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alone </ERR> the road and heard some bird crying sometimes.
After a walk, we arrived at a place where it looked like a park, there <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> had </ERR> some <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> store </ERR> and we did some shopping .
We <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> were </ERR> enjoyed this trip, and we had a good time.
On it there <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> has </ERR> a beautiful picture.
He <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> can </ERR> rang, when the morning comes, he <ERR type=[vp6,1-5]> well </ERR> ranging and wakes me up.
He just <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> like </ERR> shouting: "The sun rises up, you must get up.
" Sometimes when I look at the clock, I always think: " the clock doesn't feel tired, he still <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> working </ERR> quietly.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning, because he had completed the papers of his new invention which everyone would <ERR type=[vp9,2-2]> benefited </ERR> from it.
Two <ERR type=[wd3,1-5]> government </ERR> would come for the papers.
But at half past ten, two <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> impostor </ERR> came for the papers.
After some time, the police came and told the professor that the two men were <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> impostor </ERR> .
Many <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> country </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,4-1]> speaks </ERR> English and look on English as their mother language.
When we are in other country, <ERR type=[pr3,6-3]> you </ERR> will find that English is useful.
When you see the foreigner, you can say hello to him and also when you do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> besines </ERR> with other country, you must speak English.
English is the language that many <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> country </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,3-1]> uses </ERR> it .
In 1946, an <ERR type=[fm3,-]> american </ERR> professor whose name was John W. Mauchly invented the first computer.
today, many families have a computer, and new computer is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-0]> smaller </ERR> than the first one.
Computer can do <ERR type=[np8,0-1]> much </ERR> things such as doing business, shopping, relaxation and so on.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> computer </ERR> can also do <ERR type=[np8,0-1]> much </ERR> things that people can't do so that it is very useful for me, for us and for all the people.
In 1997, we will have five <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> subject's </ERR> exams.
Everyone in our class wants to <ERR type=[wd2,-][fm1,-]> collage </ERR> after <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> school </ERR> , so in 1997, we must try hard.
We ought to learn from Lei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fen </ERR> .
In this month, we ought to learn from our model --- <ERR type=[fm3,-]> comrade </ERR> Lei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fen </ERR> .

He had <ERR type=[vp6,2-11]> given </ERR> all he had to our Party, our country and our people.
He tried to <ERR type=[vp1,1-3]> serve </ERR> for the people, doing what he could to help others.
When you <ERR type=[vp6,2-10]> are </ERR> in trouble, he always put his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heard </ERR> in helping you.
As it <ERR type=[vp7,2-2]> known </ERR> to all, Lei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fen </ERR> is our model.
We must always <ERR type=[fm1,-]> learm </ERR> from Lei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fen </ERR> .
His spirit <ERR type=[vp9,2-4]> will </ERR> always in my mind.
Spring Spring is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comming </ERR> .

The weather in Guang zhou in spring <ERR type=[wd3,-]> turns </ERR> quickly.
When it rains, it is <ERR type=[wd2,-]> trouble </ERR> for everyone to take an umbrella.
Because of the heavy rain, the street is so wet that everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> have </ERR> to walk carefully than ever.
The sun appears in the sky and the street turns <ERR type=[fm1,-]> warmmer </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> warmmer </ERR> .
" The school's <ERR type=[np6,2-7]> singer </ERR> will have a atch in a week.

There were four students in our class joined the <ERR type=[,9-0]> match </ERR> .
They all put their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heard </ERR> into t. everyone sang high praise for them.
It is an interesting thing that this match is between a man and a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compter </ERR> .
This man <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> had </ERR> won more than ten <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> time </ERR> .
But this time, he is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challonged </ERR> by a computer.
How <ERR type=[wd3,10-2]> far </ERR> it is!
You can suppose that the match <ERR type=[vp9,2-7]> will </ERR> much exciting than everyone else.
When <ERR type=[pr4,1-5]> your </ERR> walk along the Zhujiang River, you will smell a terrible gas from the River.
When time <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> pasted </ERR> , there are some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rublish </ERR> on the river.

Many <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> country </ERR> send their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sporters </ERR> to join this match.
I think this match <ERR type=[vp9,4-4]> must </ERR> very interesting and citing.
Our country's sporters are good at this game, so every <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sporter </ERR> wants to win the match.
But they must be challenged by <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sporters </ERR> who <ERR type=[vp3,3-3]> is </ERR> in other country.

Every day at 7 o'clock, when one <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> reach </ERR> school, many students <ERR type=[vp3,2-5]> has </ERR> played games on the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> playgroune </ERR> .
At 7 o'clock P.M. many students still <ERR type=[vp6,3-1]> played </ERR> game <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> in </ERR> the playground.
Many students played basketball, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forgeting </ERR> to have dinner or supper.
It is harm to our <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> stomach </ERR> .
I think we must play in <ERR type=[cc4,2-1]> a </ERR> fit time.
After graduation, many students became a famous <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> man </ERR> .
There is a big playground where many students have sport exercises <ERR type=[wd5,11-1]> on </ERR> it.
The students <ERR type=[vp6,2-4]> loved </ERR> there school and teachers.
The students in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> class </ERR> Four are good at sport.
They also good at <ERR type=[,4-0]> basketball </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[np6,1-5][fm1,-]> sponter </ERR> of our class try their best to prevent the class to <ERR type=[vp5,4-1]> get </ERR> mark.
When they get a mark, everyone in our class hit their hand <ERR type=[wd7,12-0]> together </ERR> .

June 14 <ERR type=[fm3,-]> hot </ERR>
In the afternoon, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tempiture </ERR> almost reached 30C.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-6]> In </ERR> them, some were good at swimming.
As I <ERR type=[vp6,2-0]> seeing </ERR> , I noticed a little girl was learning swimming, the one who <ERR type=[fm2,-]> teached </ERR> her was her mother.
Seeing this, I couldn't help <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thinging </ERR> about my <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm1,-]> younth </ERR> .
I also <ERR type=[vp6,2-7]> remembered </ERR> my last swimming was ten years <ERR type=[wd3,6-0]> before </ERR> .
How joyful to have a game of table tennis or badminton after a day of study at <ERR type=[,17-0]> school </ERR> .
It is great <ERR type=[np1,1-]> value </ERR> for us to play table tennis or badminton after school.
It is <ERR type=[wd2,-]> help </ERR> to study.
The selection way <ERR type=[vp7,3-2]> will </ERR> be change.
There will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plentys </ERR> of prizes.
For example, it can <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> increase </ERR> our knowledge, improve our expressing power and thinking power.
So there would be two men come for the <ERR type=[,9-0]> papers </ERR> .
But at half past ten, There were two <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> impostor </ERR> came for the papers.
Shortly after that, there were two policemen <ERR type=[vp4,-]> came </ERR> for the case's information, but the professor said that it was necessary to catch the impostor.
For example, we can <ERR type=[wd3,2-8]> speak </ERR> "I like it very much" but cannot speak " I very like it", we can speak " I write the letters with a <ERR type=[wd4,-]> pen" </ERR> cannot speak "I use a pen to write the letters".
We should read English aloud every morning as <ERR type=[pp2,6-0]> possible </ERR> , which helps to train the language <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sence </ERR> .
And tell story with our language, because it can force us develop our mouth <ERR type=[,14-0]> muscle </ERR> .
This week we <ERR type=[vp6,3-6]> had </ERR> gone all out to practise dancing that was my first dancing.
I had never <ERR type=[vp6,3-14]> joined </ERR> in the Art Festival of school since I studied in N0.
4 Middle <ERR type=[fm3,-]> school </ERR> .But this year I have to take part in it for our class.
We didn't go home after school so that we <ERR type=[vp6,9-5]> may </ERR> have more time to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratise </ERR> .
I believe that we will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> secceed </ERR> by the effort.
This Saturday, the Art Festival of school <ERR type=[vp6,7-5]> had </ERR> been on in Peilei <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Theatry </ERR> .

The " <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Yuang </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shao </ERR> " Festival is a day for family and for those people <ERR type=[wd5,4-2]> who </ERR> in love.
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> uses </ERR> , cars, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bicks </ERR> and many people go up and down the street.
People have a habit of going to the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Flowers </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Market </ERR> .
It is said that people who have one around the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Flowers </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Market </ERR> will change their lucks.
The lowers Market <ERR type=[vp3,3-5]> get </ERR> more beautiful and <ERR type=[wd6,9-1]> more </ERR> beautiful.
[wd4,0-10] The first day of the year, almost <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> people </ERR> go to temples.
[wd4,0-15] The second day of the year, <ERR type=[wd4,0-9]> almost </ERR> people pay a visit to their friends or relatives.
It is the <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> most </ERR> thing to get together with family.
Of corse the residents are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> glade </ERR> to help them.
The street officials get the money together to buy some <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> gift </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,13-2]> to </ERR> the cripples.
The street officials borrow <ERR type=[fm1,-]> serveral </ERR> wheelchairs from hospital, they take the cripples to the Flowers Market with them.
The <ERR type=[np5,-]> knowledges </ERR> exchange.
He must in exchange for other <ERR type=[,6-0]> countries </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Expecially </ERR> the <ERR type=[np5m-]> knowledges </ERR> exchange .
Hong Kong is coming <ERR type=[wd4,5-1]> back </ERR> the homeland.
The <ERR type=[np5,1-0]> knowledges </ERR> of Guang zhou and Hong Kong are both rich and interesting.
Students should <ERR type=[cc3,2-1]> learn </ERR> <ERR type=[np5,-]> knowledges </ERR> about the <ERR type=[wd4,-]> practical </ERR> .
And what we have learned can be used in <ERR type=[wd2,9-0]> practical </ERR> .
I think what we have learned <ERR type=[vp3,6-1]> are </ERR> useless.
<ERR type=[wd3,0-9]> Whether </ERR> someone asks us to write a letter for job, then how can we do.
The first <ERR type=[wd2,-]> failing </ERR> in English
Last week we <ERR type=[vp6,3-8]> had </ERR> had the first English exam in this term.
But this time I <ERR type=[vp6,4-1]> had </ERR> failed.
Last week, a great fire <ERR type=[vp7,3-2]> was </ERR> broken out in the Weng chang Road.
The wires were heated, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tempereture </ERR> was so high that a fire <ERR type=[vp9,2-2]> could </ERR> broke out.
The fire soon spread through the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> while </ERR> house and the neighbours'.
There was a man died of the <ERR type=[,7-0]> fire </ERR> .
The fire <ERR type=[vp3,2-5]> give </ERR> people a lesson: be careful of the fire.
Reading is important to us, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> xpecially </ERR> the English <ERR type=[np6,8-0]> learner </ERR> .
If you want to get high marks in the examination you should pay <ERR type=[fm1,-]> attentino </ERR> to reading,including reading aloud and reading compositions.
they talk <ERR type=[wd6,2-5]> talk </ERR> about all kinds of things in English just like old friends.
At last, the leaders thought highly of our school, and hoped that our school <ERR type=[vp6,5-7]> will </ERR> make even more progress in the future.
Li Ming <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> felt </ERR> great difficult to learn English at <ERR type=[pr2,9-0]> first </ERR> .
He worked hard, and often asked the <ERR type=[wd4,3-8]> teacher </ERR> some advice on how to learn a foreign language.
Before long he <ERR type=[vp6,3-3]> had </ERR> made rapid progress and was praised by his teacher.
There are two <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> class-building </ERR> , a dormitory, eight labs and a library in our school.

So I even like my new school, and make up my mind to study hard and <ERR type=[vp1,0-3]> reward </ERR> to my teachers.
Then we went <ERR type=[wd4,0-2]> to </ERR> North sea Park to go boating, where we had <ERR type=[vp6,15-3]> played </ERR> nearly two hours.
Most of them were good <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> player </ERR> .
I often <ERR type=[vp2,0-2]> went </ERR> to swimming in my childhood.
When I spent my holiday in Beijing <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> in </ERR> ten years ago, I <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> went </ERR> to swimming for the last time.
I'm <ERR type=[np7,-]> team </ERR> leader <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> on </ERR> the school team.
Our team <ERR type=[vp6,2-5]> had </ERR> failed in the last game.
But we do not <ERR type=[cc5,-4]> take </ERR> our fate lying down.
One candle <ERR type=[wd2,2-4]> likes </ERR> very small and ordinary.
If we leave the teacher, we will <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> have </ERR> no knowledge, <ERR type=[wd4,7-2]> become </ERR> very silly, as if a man who can not see.
He handed a stick, which was <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> Hanging </ERR> bananas.
But the elephant didn't be <ERR type=[vp2,4-3]> interested </ERR> in the bananas, and went on playing with the ball.
After a moment, the man brought a basket, which <ERR type=[vp7,3-7]> filled </ERR> with apples, pears, mangoes, tomatoes and oranges.
To everyone's surprise, the elephant immediately put away the ball, and <ERR type=[vp6,8-3]> walk </ERR> away the ground.
On <ERR type=[np2,1-0]> fact </ERR> , to practise running, a long run, on the playground .
Everyone in the class must love it from his heart, must consider it as important as his life, and serve it <ERR type=[wd3,3-0]> whenever </ERR> .
Many boys in our class <ERR type=[vp6,5-4]> liked </ERR> football since Senior 1.
But also watched a football match on TV on <ERR type=[,20-0]> holiday </ERR> .
Now, football in our class has good chance to <ERR type=[cc4,-3]> develop. </ERR> .
Su Wei jie's coming makes everyone very joyful, particularly <ERR type=[wd5,9-3]> is </ERR> Liang Jian ling.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> all believe tomorrow will be better.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> To </ERR> our surprised, Liang Jian ling didn't finish the homework twice this week.
So as soon as the winter comes, "bear" will become very <ERR type=[fm1-]> luzy </ERR> , this is reasonable.
Today, two <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> practical </ERR> teachers are going back to their school.
Because they are as old as us <ERR type=[ad1,6-0]> nearly </ERR> , we regard them as friends more than teachers.
let's remember these two <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> particular </ERR> friends for ever.
We learned a text <ERR type=[vp4,4-4]> calls </ERR> "Zhu Fu" days ago.
She was a working <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wowan </ERR> who was ppressed before liberation.
After her husband had died, Xiang Lin <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Sao </ERR> didn't take her fate lying down.
From now on, we should <ERR type=[ad1,1-1]> more </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,3-2]> love </ERR> our <ERR type=[wd4,10-1]> living, </ERR> study harder.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> our </ERR> class is an excellent upward collective.
Till the head teacher promised she would give reward to the students who <ERR type=[vp3,8-7]> is </ERR> willing to do it in moral education, some one tried to be the first to do.
Collective <ERR type=[vp3,1-4]> belong </ERR> to all of us.
They must regard our class as their permanent <ERR type=[fm1,-]> destianation </ERR> .
On the other hand, we make a statement: we welcome everyone to join our class, so long as <ERR type=[pr3,10-6]> they </ERR> love this collective in the heart, willingly and gladly serve it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> otherwise </ERR> they are persona non grata.
this would be a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> majoy </ERR> event in our class's democratic life.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> to </ERR> our class, such a special collective, having a group of competent cadres is very important.
I hope this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> electioneering </ERR> will be successful.
The elected cadres must have served all the classmates, led our class to be <ERR type=[wd3,-]> flourishing </ERR> .
When it was eleven o'clock, the police telephoned that the right men who came from London had been <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kidnaped </ERR> on their way to Professor Hunter's house.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> To </ERR> everyone's surprised, Professor Hunter said that it was not necessary to catch that two men.
He explained that the papers that two men had taken <ERR type=[vp3,10-2]> was </ERR> not important... At last, Professor Hunter decided to take the real papers to London himself.
<ERR type=[fm3,-][pr1,-]> constitution </ERR> stipulates: "Citizen enjoys criticism, proposal, petition, complaint and accusation <ERR type=[np6,8-0]> right </ERR> .
The propagandist <ERR type=[vp3,2-5]> have </ERR> already <ERR type=[cc3,0-3]> constituted </ERR> the blackmail crime.
On the other hand, when the propagandist published <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> stumping </ERR> speech, he said that he would propagate the football gratis.
Now, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-5]> have </ERR> gone back on his word, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-0]> have </ERR> deceived us.
teacher <ERR type=[vp7,4-3]> calls </ERR> " Long Sea, Thunder".
That he is tall and powerful, also shows that he comes from <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> North China.
They <ERR type=[wd7,1-6]> over </ERR> believe the people at our side, like the teachers who taught us before.
They even composed a ci <ERR type=[fm1,-]> peom </ERR> again.
Our head teacher and we had thought that there could be four programs <ERR type=[vp4,5-2]> enter </ERR> the finals.
Long <ERR type=[wd6,-]> long </ERR> ago, there was a famous prime minister in China.
he called Wei <ERR type=[vp7,3-0]> zheng </ERR> .
I didn't write it only ask for <ERR type=[,7-0]> help </ERR> .
Miss Lin, " good advice jars on the ear <ERR type=[wd4,6-4]> helps </ERR> to do things better", do you know?
It is impossible that a student has not <ERR type=[cc1,4-]> pressure </ERR> in the exam.
Being a student in the emphasis <ERR type=[cc4,1-0]> class </ERR> , the <ERR type=[cc3,1-5]> pressure </ERR> I have had is bigger.
Especially is <ERR type=[,2-0]> family </ERR> , because the parents all hope their children will have a bright future.
The strong sense of responsibility drove me to study more <ERR type=[ad3,1-0]> harder </ERR> .So the pressure the head teacher <ERR type=[cc3,5-5]> gave </ERR> me helps me to victory.
That is to say, I must <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> tank </ERR> her.
My winter holiday is very brief, but it <ERR type=[ad1,1-3]> enough </ERR> makes me busy.
Innumerable holiday <ERR type=[np5,2-0]> homeworks </ERR> , preparing the coming new year, preparing the new term ... all of these must be done in thirteen days.
Free and unrestrained living <ERR type=[vp3,4-5]> don't </ERR> belong to me at all.
So I don't <ERR type=[vp2,2-4]> get </ERR> more interest in it as I grow up.
Some of these flowers <ERR type=[cc2,4-1]> feel </ERR> fragrant, others look very beautiful.
Though the Spring Festival is during my winter holiday, I can't be happy to my heart's content, because I have to hurry to do my holiday home <ERR type=[np5,4-0]> works </ERR> .
On <ERR type=[fm3,-]> february </ERR> the third, I saw a piece of good news in the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Yang </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Cheng </ERR> Evening Paper.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> though </ERR> they needn't do homework, and needn't support the parents scold, the teachers still felt very tired and made their head swim.
After copying the students' example, the teachers generally said that the students <ERR type=[vp3,7-4]> was </ERR> really tired and suffering.
They also said that the knowledge which the students <ERR type=[vp7,-]> taught </ERR> is <ERR type=[aj3,-2]> dry </ERR> as dust, and needed mechanical memorizing.
Someone even said that if things go on like this, students aren't able to become talents who <ERR type=[vp7,7-5]> needs </ERR> in twenty-first century.
The fierce wind <ERR type=[vp3,3-10]> hug </ERR> layers of billow, and ferociously throw them to the cliff.
The sea catches the lightning, and lets <ERR type=[pr3,7-5]> them </ERR> go out in their abyss.
She hinted that young students <ERR type=[vp6,5-4]> cannot </ERR> have a love affair.
At that time, we must hand in 65 yuan before travelling to Xi <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Qiao </ERR> Hill.
But some of us took a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sceptical </ERR> attitude on handing in so much money.
In all fairness, our grade master <ERR type=[vp3,3-4]> care </ERR> for us very much.
So we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> intentionaly </ERR> trouble her, too.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> confrontation Again.
He regarded the grade master as a tiger <ERR type=[pr5,8-7]> which </ERR> didn't let boys or girls love together.
what did <ERR type=[pr4,2-1]> his </ERR> mean?
Remember, the world <ERR type=[fm1,-]> relongs </ERR> to them and me.
It is at a quarter past six on Monday morning that I <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> writer </ERR> this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> arcticle </ERR> .
That is to say, I have <ERR type=[vp6,2-8]> been </ERR> asleep for five hours in the past evening.
In fact, on Saturday evening and Sunday day and night, I <ERR type=[wd2,-]> few </ERR> stopped writing, <ERR type=[wd3,-]> few </ERR> left my house for a walk.
Since the new term began, the time that I spent on problems and home work was more than that I had a rest---the necessary rest.I always go to bed late at night, and get up much earlier than <ERR type=[wd5,14-1]> any </ERR> others.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> on </ERR> the other hand, their teacher <ERR type=[vp3,2-4]> don't </ERR> let them play football in most of their spare time.
Because their teacher <ERR type=[vp3,2-0]> think </ERR> that this will affect their study .
I think these two <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> opinion </ERR> are <ERR type=[pr6,6-1]> all </ERR> right.
After either the students or their teacher knows this piece of reason, what they can only do is <ERR type=[vp4,6-2]> understand </ERR> each other.
Such a slogan, like the opium, puzzled and <ERR type=[vp6,8-9]> poison </ERR> some of our classmates since it came into being.
Though this slogan is seldom talked of by us now, it has already taken root <ERR type=[wd3,5-3]> among </ERR> our hearts deeply.
Our class cadre <ERR type=[vp6,3-2]> is </ERR> too many.
But s a public, I find that some of them are very at ordinary <ERR type=[wd7,10-0]> times </ERR> .
They are not <ERR type=[fm1,-]> arctive </ERR> in helping the students whose study is not very good.
On the other hand, some of the cadres <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> made </ERR> mistakes recently.
I also find that some of his characters <ERR type=[vp3,4-2]> is </ERR> as mine.
So our homeland is the largest country in <ERR type=[wd5,7-1]> the </ERR> Asia, and one of the largest countries in the world.
Our country has rich <ERR type=[fm1,-]> minecals </ERR> , aquatic resources, natural forests and water power resources.
When they descended the hill, they <ERR type=[vp6,6-3]> choose </ERR> a wrong way, o that they had to walk a long way.
This made them went back home late and <ERR type=[,8-0]> tired </ERR> .
But she thought it <ERR type=[vp3,4-2]> is </ERR> a challenge.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> now </ERR> , I am good at walking even a very long way.
I can say in pride if I had walked the same way with those classmates that day, I would not <ERR type=[vp8,15-11]> feel </ERR> tired, and I could urge them to walk faster and faster.
It will cause the accident damage to us, like wound the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ligament </ERR> and feet .
Let's walk as fast as we can, so that we can pursue the sun --- the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> brilliantest </ERR> victory.
When I was in Senior <ERR type=[fm3,-]> one </ERR> , I often took photos of my classmates.
For <ERR type=[fm1,-]> examply </ERR> , even on the day when school opened, I took photos of them, in order to cause them to notice me.
And after the photos were developed and printed, I would give the photos to each <ERR type=[wd3,7-0]> character </ERR> .As three months were past, I had already taken photos of them three times, and I had gathered more than one hundred pictures.
Then I chose fifty- four <ERR type=[pr6,5-2]> ones </ERR> from them, and made these photos into a pair of playing cards.
Altogether I spent more than <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ninty </ERR> yuan on them.
Broken Arms In the last two weeks, several matters about basketball <ERR type=[vp6,9-4]> have </ERR> happened in our class.
It was more disgusting that they led some boys who <ERR type=[vp3,10-10]> don't </ERR> belong to the No.4 Middle School into our school.
This must be said that " when those above behave <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unworthily </ERR> , those below will do the <ERR type=[pr2,15-0]> same </ERR> .
<SEX 2> <Y 7> <AGE ?> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> <WAY 2> <Title A GOOD TEACHER-STUDENT RELATIONSHIP> <SCORE 6> <SCH HENAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY> A good teacher-student <ERR type=[np5,-]> relationship </ERR> is based on respect.
<ERR type=[np6,-]> Teacher </ERR> must <ERR type=[wd4,-]> respect </ERR> student's <ERR type=[np6,-]> request </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> choise </ERR> .
When students require <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> to give more <ERR type=[fm2,-]> out-book-knowledge </ERR> , <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> should try to add it in class.
And after class, students <ERR type=[vp9,-]> can </ERR> do their <ERR type=[np6,-][vp2,-]> hobby </ERR> as they like while teacher <ERR type=[vp9,-]> can't </ERR> stand in their way.
The student should, in turn, respect <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> .
For example, when <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> try to <ERR type=[wd3,-]> satisfy </ERR> students, students should listen carefully and gain something from it.
When <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> gives students <ERR type=[np6,-]> chance </ERR> to do what they <ERR type=[vp1,-]> like </ERR> , students should try their best and do it well.
A good teacher-student <ERR type=[np5,-]> relationship </ERR> is also based on mutual understanding.
Let's suppose that if students don't do the work <ERR type=[wd4,-]> as </ERR> teacher's <ERR type=[np6,-]> request </ERR> , <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> should make <ERR type=[wd5,-]> it </ERR> clear the reason so that <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> won't wrong students.
On other hand, if <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> criticize students <ERR type=[wd2,-]> wrong </ERR> , students should <ERR type=[wd3,-]> know </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,-]> teacher </ERR> only wants them to study well.
By this way a good teacher-student <ERR type=[np5,-]> relationship </ERR> is built up.
It suggests that if you want to achieve something quickly, <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> however </ERR> you always can not get it.
In previous <ERR type=[np6,2-]> time </ERR> , China wanted keenly to reach <ERR type=[fm1,-]> communisty </ERR> society early.
However, it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> made our national <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> develop slowly, and to some <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> extents </ERR> , it did harm <ERR type=[vp1,1-4]> to </ERR> our national <ERR type=[fm2,-]> economic's </ERR> development.
Our national <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> become </ERR> apparently better than ever.
[fm2,-]
There are some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> reason </ERR> for it.
First, when someone is <ERR type=[wd2,-]> haste </ERR> , he hasn't enough time to think what he should do and how he should do.
So it will cause somebody <ERR type=[vp1,2-]> does </ERR> what he needn't do.
On the other hand, haste makes people not <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> know </ERR> how to do .
<ERR type=[wd3,-s]> But </ERR> all will reach nothing.
When someone is in bad mood, he <ERR type=[fm2,-]> willn't </ERR> do a good thing, so what he has <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> do </ERR> will be waste.
For example, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> studing </ERR> English can't <ERR type=[wd2,-]> haste </ERR> .
If someone is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> hurry </ERR> to make his English <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> level </ERR> progress <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fastly </ERR> .
He <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> don't </ERR> begin from base and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> willn't </ERR> learn English well.
When someone is filling a bottle with water, and he is impatient, <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> so </ERR> he <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> makes </ERR> it quickly but most of the water <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> is </ERR> dropped out of the bottle.
Then, why <ERR type=[vp3,-s]> do </ERR> haste <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> makes </ERR> waste.
Firstly, I think, haste can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> makes </ERR> people upset, and then influence <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> acts.
Secondly, once people <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> haste </ERR> , <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> he </ERR> can not control his <ERR type=[fm2,-]> activeness </ERR> well and does things in wrong ways.
For instance, someone is <ERR type=[wd2,-]> haste </ERR> to get <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> train </ERR> .
The time is rather limited, so he is upset, he takes his <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> suitcase </ERR> hurried to the railway station.
When he arrives at the station, he finds his ticket is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> forgotten </ERR> in his home.
And in order to avoid <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> and make things good and quick, we should not haste and we ought to make calme.
<ERR type=[cc3,1-]> [fm1,-] </ERR>
Someone wants to do well in <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> , he must grasp the principles which are in the things.
It should <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> take </ERR> man for a long time to understand <ERR type=[pr1,-]> it </ERR> .For example: a man wants to master a foreign language.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Regulerly </ERR> learning and reviewing is important <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> to </ERR> learn language.
Finally, he will find that he can apply <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> easily.
It is impossible for a man do <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> well </ERR> things in <ERR type=[np8,-1]> few </ERR> time.
There is a famous <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> say </ERR> that haste makes waste.
In short, if one wants to finish his work as possible as he can, he will make the work even worse on the <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> contrary </ERR> .
There are many reasons that we can be <ERR type=[vp7,3-]> found </ERR> make <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> out </ERR> .
First, if a <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> unskilled </ERR> man <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> set </ERR> out to do some difficult work, and he is asked to <ERR type=[vp1,-]> finish </ERR> in a short time, he will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nevous </ERR> .
As a result, he can finish it on time.Second, one must do things in turn, then he can finish them <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succefully </ERR> .
Thinking a man <ERR type=[vp5,-s]> do </ERR> things without his rule, you can know that the sooner he wants to be, the more slowly he does it .
Finally, if someone hasn't been <ERR type=[ad2,2-1]> good </ERR> prepared for the work, he can't do it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succefully </ERR> .
That is to say, one must make things <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> well-equipped </ERR> before he starts to <ERR type=[vp1,-]> do </ERR> .
We must do things <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> in </ERR> a good step.
Take it easy, as long as you are skilled and well-equipped <ERR type=[np6,3-]> person </ERR> .
Perhaps, you run into these <ERR type=[np3,1-]> case </ERR> .
Upside <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> down </ERR> the room, but can't found it .
When you want to remember the words in the dictionary in several days, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> but </ERR> the result of which is that you only remember <ERR type=[wd3,-]> few </ERR> .
The two <ERR type=[np3,1-]> example </ERR> I list both <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ellustrate </ERR> the principle.
So <ERR type=[pr2,-s]> it </ERR> could be <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> concluded </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> that </ERR> .
As a proverb <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> say </ERR> : Haste Makes Waste.
It's quite clear that a haste <ERR type=[np3,2-]> people </ERR> can't make achievement because <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> he </ERR> hasn't prepared enough.
<ERR type=[pr2,-s]> It </ERR> is known to all of us.
However, his mother <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> let </ERR> him run to her.
He can't reach <ERR type=[vp1,1-]> to </ERR> her without any help.
No one can <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> deny </ERR> it cost him many <ERR type=[np8,1-]> time </ERR> to walk well, much more time to run.
So we should think <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> over before we begin <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
Second, sometimes we have to do it again because of the <ERR type=[fm2,-2]> lackless </ERR> of care.
For example, when we go to school, we would bring the book and other <ERR type=[wd3,-]> thins </ERR> such as glasses.
But we forget to bring the glass <ERR type=[wd3,-]> before </ERR> of haste.
For another example, we <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> haste </ERR> do the thing again when we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> did </ERR> it wrong.
In a word, we should do a thing <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> careful </ERR> and think about it before we start to do it.
We usually <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> hear </ERR> that someone say to another men "Haste Make Waste".
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> there </ERR> are some reasons for <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-1]> The </ERR> first, when you have a good <ERR type=[vp2,3-]> haste </ERR> to do something, you will have a short time to consider the other fact that will effect the thing.
<ERR type=[pr2,-s]> It </ERR> will <ERR type=[vp7,-s]> not </ERR> satisfied to yourself and others.
Second, if you have a good haste, but the other conditions can't keep up <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> with </ERR> you, so you must stop to wait.
To the <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> first </ERR> , it will cause you must do it again .
To the <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> second </ERR> , it will cause you spent your time in waiting .
So the two <ERR type=[wd7,4-2]> ways </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> waste.
For example, it will have <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> examination.
A student <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> found </ERR> he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> many books not to read.
So he decided to have a quick look <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> on </ERR> all the books.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> he will have much time.
But he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> don't </ERR> understand it, or he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> don't </ERR> catch the main point to read.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> when he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> get </ERR> the paper, he will find that many <ERR type=[np8,1-]> knowledge </ERR> have being <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> seen </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> But </ERR> he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> didn't </ERR> do it because he didn't understand it.
So he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> waste </ERR> the time.
We can <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> say </ERR> him "Haste makes waste".
It means that you do everything <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> should </ERR> step by step , then you can get <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succed </ERR> .
For example, it's the same in learning <ERR type=[np6,1-]> language </ERR> .
First, the student <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> learn </ERR> the letters, then words, at last, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> know </ERR> how to use them to make a sentence and an <ERR type=[cc3,5-]> article </ERR> .
During the course, the learner must work very hard, master everything he needs, such as the words, the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> programmer </ERR> and so many things.
He <ERR type=[vp9,-s]> must </ERR> very patient and <ERR type=[vp9,4-]> has </ERR> a specific aid.
Finally, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> master </ERR> it.
If you do it too fast, you may make mistakes <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> though </ERR> you haven't <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> think </ERR> about it carefully.
If <ERR type=[wd1,-s]> unfortunately </ERR> you go too far from the right way, it will be very difficult to correct your mistakes.
You do everything need enough preparation and good <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> fundamental </ERR> .
Then you will find that your <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> former </ERR> flexible fingers become <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> dull </ERR> and the mind <ERR type=[vp9,-3]> is </ERR> seemed to be stupid.
Maybe you will go out of the door to find that the key is <ERR type=[wd3,-]> without </ERR> you.
When you are in <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> nervous </ERR> , you can do anything but <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> success </ERR> .
The examples we can easily <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> found </ERR> in our life.
Imagine that you have a <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> date </ERR> and you are nearly to be late.
How embarrassed <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> is!
When final exams <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> comes </ERR> , we should prepare all the lessons, we will skim all the books but don't know which one we should take first.
Some people may <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> don't </ERR> think so.
Because we are in <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> hasty </ERR> , we have a <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> press </ERR> , we can't do well at last.
Everyone may <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> happened </ERR> to such a situation.
When you leave home in the end, you may find that you go out without the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> bag </ERR> .
It is the haste that <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> make </ERR> you have to go back home.
<ERR type=[wd3,-s]> What </ERR> you do quickly is only to waste your time.
Otherwise, all that we do only <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> lead </ERR> to waste.
"Haste makes waste" is a <ERR type=[wd3,-]> probe </ERR> in China.
The words <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> reasonable and popular in our daylife.
[fm1,-] When you have a task to do.
A task <ERR type=[wd1,-1]> also </ERR> may have some details you should <ERR type=[wd3,-]> remarkable </ERR> .
But you want to do the job very quickly, neglect the details, ignore the circumstance <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> when </ERR> you complete the task, perhaps many things you haven't done.
Perhaps a task <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> consist </ERR> of several parts.
<ERR type=[pp1,-1]> After </ERR> complete all the parts you complete the task.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> But </ERR> perhaps you want to <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> "Haste" </ERR> you do this part and forget that part.
And the task is never <ERR type=[wd3,-]> complete </ERR> .
A job <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> some fundamental <ERR type=[wd3,-]> factors </ERR> .
Just <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> study English.
We study English from A, B,C, to make <ERR type=[np6,2-]> sentence </ERR> to write article.
[np6, 1-] We should learn the idiom and grammar.
The sentences you made is wrong and you can't understand the newspaper, and it's difficulty to write <ERR type=[np6,2-]> article </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> Only </ERR> you learn many idioms and grammar, and speak and write English every day.
It means if a man wants to get the result fastly, maybe the fast leads to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unceccess </ERR> .
At first, everything has its natural <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> proceed </ERR> , we must obey it and should not surpass it.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> Only </ERR> we have done it step by step, we can succeed.
For example, when we study English, we should study the word, firstly it is the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> primary </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd5,-]> the </ERR> language.
Then we should study the grammar, then to read <ERR type=[np6,1-]> text </ERR> and do <ERR type=[np6,1-]> exercise </ERR> .
Such <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> as </ERR> when we have passed CET4 we can attend the test CET6.
If we want get a good mark, we must study <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> step by step.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Sencondly </ERR> , the more we do things <ERR type=[ad3,s-]> fastly, </ERR> the more mistakes or dangers will <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> be </ERR> appear.
For <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> instance, if we drive a car to a place, we should obey the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> trafic </ERR> rules, otherwise we may get in trouble.
Every one <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> want </ERR> to succeed.
Every one knows that haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> waste.
But when you are in a competition, you will think: "oh, I must do the work better than her (him), I must <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> also </ERR> faster than her (him), faster and faster...." So you <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> may </ERR> in a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fuss </ERR> .
Because you are so <ERR type=[fm1,-]> earger </ERR> that you can't think over the whole thing correctly.
I remember one day when I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> am </ERR> studying in a middle school.
It was 12 o'clock already and I wanted to have the lunch prepared half an hour <ERR type=[wd5,-]> later </ERR> before my mother went back.
Form then on, I knew that haste makes waste and that if you want to succeed, you should do everything after you have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> think </ERR> it over.
It <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> is </ERR> means: if you want something to be done quickly, however, it would <ERR type=[vp9,2-2]> be </ERR> work slowly; if you want to make something done better, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> but </ERR> it would be worse.
Why people <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> are </ERR> think of <ERR type=[vp5,-2]> haste </ERR> makes waste?
The reason is that, when someone plans to do something, he always hopes to be <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> done </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> excessfully </ERR> and eagerly, which <ERR type=[vp9,-s]> is </ERR> cause to <ERR type=[vp5,-3]> waste </ERR> time and <ERR type=[wd3,-]> hard </ERR> .
For example, in winter, students <ERR type=[vp9,-2]> are </ERR> get up late.
Because we are too late to catch the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> class </ERR> on time, so we want to how to quickly to save our time .
We may hurry to carry our books and notes to the classroom, but when we reach the classroom, we would find the pen <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> left </ERR> the dormitory, or we would find we got the notes <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> wrong </ERR> .
This is <ERR type=[np7,-2]> an </ERR> good example <ERR type=[pp1,-3]> of </ERR> haste makes waste.
In order to avoid <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> of </ERR> haste makes waste, we should do anything <ERR type=[fm1,-]> repairely </ERR> , we should not <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> wonder </ERR> the result but wonder the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> efficient </ERR> .
So, we can do everything well <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> than </ERR> haste makes waste.
Every student <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> want </ERR> to master the knowledge <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> in </ERR> soon, but, it is only a daydream.
Study is a long course that <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> need </ERR> people's continuing hard work and to spend plenty of time .
Understanding one article, firstly, you must master mostly words and be able to know the <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> means </ERR> of every sentence.
When you do <ERR type=[wd1,-s]> well </ERR> all kinds of basic work, you may understand an article.
At last, we get the aim or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exchang </ERR> with time and our energy.
So, it's a rule of nature <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> to </ERR> haste make waste.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> think </ERR> it's very efficient that you spend little time doing things better.
Because you want to save time to do something, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> so </ERR> you're always <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> want </ERR> to escape doing something.
But it's very <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> unfortunately </ERR> , the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> something </ERR> which you want to escape is just very important part of something <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> which </ERR> you'll do.
So at last you not only don't finish this <ERR type=[wd3,-]> matter </ERR> , but also you spend more time.
For instance, we are in <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> line </ERR> to buy tickets <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> of </ERR> movie.
But there are some <ERR type=[wd4,2-5]> people </ERR> don't keep in the line, they <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> crash </ERR> to the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> front </ERR> .
The outcome of these <ERR type=[np3,1-]> action </ERR> is that more and more people are crowded to buy tickets.
So I think when you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dicide </ERR> to do something, you'd better finish it step by step.
Maybe someone can't <ERR type=[vp1,-]> understand </ERR> and asks why it is.
In ancient <ERR type=[np6,1-]> time </ERR> , Jin <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> country </ERR> wanted attack Song <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> country </ERR> .
The leader ordered a soildier to make marks the day before they <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> studied </ERR> .
But the leader <ERR type=[fm2,-][wd3,-]> sticked </ERR> to <ERR type=[vp5,2-]> do </ERR> what he wanted.
As a result, they <ERR type=[vp6,-]> can't </ERR> find the marks which <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> they </ERR> had been destroyed by the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> flood </ERR> .
From the story, we can know that if you want to achieve your <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> target </ERR> , you must think of all factors.
If you want to become <ERR type=[np6,1-]> singer </ERR> , you should <ERR type=[vp1,-]> practise </ERR> everyday and ask <ERR type=[vp2,-2]> for </ERR> music teacher who will lead you to the true <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> way </ERR> .
Each success <ERR type=[fm1,-]> includs </ERR> hard work.
On the road of success, there is no <ERR type=[wd3,-]> easy </ERR> .
Our motherland <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> needs </ERR> all us to work hard for her.
Let us use our own hands to create our <ERR type=[wd3,-]> tomorrows </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> you have to do it again.
So when I was a little girl, my parents and teachers often <ERR type=[wd3,-4]> thought </ERR> me to be cautious.
" For individual, I think it may be <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> not </ERR> a serious thing, but if you are in a high position and change of some important things or a lot of money.
Haste will <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> lost </ERR> you much and may <ERR type=[wd3,-]> lost </ERR> your company, your country much .
Long ago there was a young man who wanted to enter the city with his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> servent </ERR> .
They <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> in a boat.
[wd4,-2] Sun was coming down so he <ERR type=[wd3,-5]> fastened </ERR> the owner of the boat, an old man.
The old man told him slowly, "If you don't <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> fasten </ERR> me I can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> sent </ERR> you <ERR type=[wd3,-]> in </ERR> the city before the gate closing.
If you <ERR type=[wd3,-]> fasten </ERR> , I think I can't do it.
" The young man didn't believe him, so the old man <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> fastened </ERR> his boat.
In solving a problem or doing a job, all factors are <ERR type=[cc2,2-2]> doing </ERR> <ERR type=[pr3,3-]> its </ERR> work.
" For instance, during the preparation for the CET 6, because I have <ERR type=[wd3,-]> sailed </ERR> through the CET 4, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> so </ERR> I thought it was just a piece of cake.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> Then </ERR> I tried to memorize every word in the dictionary in such a short time.
Even if I <ERR type=[wd3,-]> studied </ERR> hundreds of <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> words </ERR> each day, when I was reading, the words that I have seen still be unknown to me.
But <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> in </ERR> true, haste make waste.
For example, we want a good <ERR type=[np3,2-]> marks </ERR> in the test.
We couldn't learn some course in <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> some </ERR> day.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> , we can master it well and do it well.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> we can say haste makes success is impossible .
Success <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> need </ERR> time, and energy.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> we must have good basis.
It comes from we learn some course from high school <ERR type=[wd3,-]> to </ERR> university.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> I can say if you want success quickly, you need <ERR type=[wd3,-]> basis </ERR> , energy and time.
You should learn everything which will <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> benefit </ERR> to you, to do some work in society.
In a word, we want success <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> rapid </ERR> , we need <ERR type=[wd3,-]> basis </ERR> and knowledge , <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> otherwise </ERR> , haste makes waste.
It is <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> obvious </ERR> most of persons have their own views.
There are <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> someone </ERR> reasons: some people may go in for the work; some people think it was the only work that they can do best; other people may be afraid of unemployment after they give up the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> origine </ERR> work.
Most of them want to learn well in every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> fields </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Nowdays </ERR> , technology is <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> improving </ERR> quickly.
In brief, it is the society that <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> call </ERR> for people changing their work.
In my opinion, we can learn something through changing jobs, so I agree to <ERR type=[vp5,2-]> change </ERR> jobs.
And which job <ERR type=[vp9,-2]> is </ERR> he like?
Why he usually <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> change </ERR> his job?
Some people like working <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> a certain job.
At the same time, they get on well with their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> workmates </ERR> .
They wouldn't like to make new friends again <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> at </ERR> other company.
And it'll take them some time to <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> adapt </ERR> to new <ERR type=[np6,1-]> environment </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,-s]> Otherwise </ERR> , some people like changing jobs constantly.
And they can do many things to avoid losing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
In general, I like stable <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
But do people like <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> ?
Here are some <ERR type=[np5,2-]> news </ERR> .
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,1-2]> like </ERR> do one job all along.
More important is that <ERR type=[fm2,-]> workmates </ERR> are familiar to each other.
However, someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> change </ERR> their jobs constantly.
You may go on with <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> it </ERR> , it is good for your future.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Nowdays </ERR> most of us like to work.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to go in for a stationary work, while others like to change their jobs at one time.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> tend </ERR> to do a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> simlar </ERR> job.
They just like to have a stationary condition, they also consider that they have to do a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> simlar </ERR> job because of studying something.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> hold </ERR> the contrary idea, ie.
they like to do a <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unsimlar </ERR> job at the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unsimlar </ERR> time.
They think they can get some <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unsimilar </ERR> experience.
[fm1,-] Because I like business, but not like science to study.
Many people want to take up <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> unchanged through their life.
Usually, people want to take unchanged <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> for such reasons: they enjoy their own job; they want to live stable <ERR type=[np6,1-]> life </ERR> ; they want to be more skilled in their job.... Of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couse </ERR> , some people do not want to change their job only because they are afraid of not finding a new job.
Some of them are always unsatisfied with their job, the others, especially young staff may change their job for this reason, they want to live <ERR type=[fm1,-]> adventering </ERR> life, want to experience new life.
In my view, to a young man, more experience to various jobs will be helpful to enhance his <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> composition </ERR> , and will <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> benefit </ERR> to his capability to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> adapting </ERR> new circumstance.
But we must be <ERR type=[wd2,-]> seriously </ERR> when we decide to change our job.
Some people like doing the same job from <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> begin </ERR> to end.
Some people like doing the same job, also because they like <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> stabling </ERR> .
Perhaps, the job is not very <ERR type=[fm2,-]> satisfacting </ERR> , but they will do it for ever, because they don't like always changing their jobs.
However, some people like changing their jobs from time <ERR type=[pp2,2-1]> and </ERR> time.
Because they feel doing the same job is <ERR type=[fm2,-]> dulling </ERR> .
In new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviornment </ERR> , they can find a lot of interesting things.
I think, the two kinds of people have a different <ERR type=[np3,2-]> characters </ERR> .
Some people always like taking on a kind <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> of </ERR> job.
They may specialize in the major about <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> on campus.
Second, After they start to work, as <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> times </ERR> pass, they are <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> proficiency </ERR> in the job gradually.
They <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> are </ERR> worried that there are some difficulties once they change the job.
They always can be <ERR type=[wd2,-]> confidence </ERR> in overcoming the obstacles in the jobs.
They want to learn more knowledge and work experiences so, they can sum up the experience so as to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acheive </ERR> great success.
But I think we youth should take on a challenging job, we have <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> encourage </ERR> and ability to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> adapt </ERR> to the change of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scientity </ERR> .
After we accumulate the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> work </ERR> , experiences, we may <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> select </ERR> to the interesting job.
But it is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffirent </ERR> from some persons to others about <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Job-Hopping </ERR> .
They consider that the <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> convert </ERR> job will bring you a fresh sense, thus you can find our potential energy constantly.
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> seem </ERR> to be reasonable for both the views.
But I think parts of the two <ERR type=[np3,1-]> view </ERR> are right, and parts wrong.
<ERR type=[pr1,-s]> It </ERR> has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffirent </ERR> traits from person to person, some persons with these traits will <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> suit </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,-3]> for </ERR> do the same job all along, but some persons with those traits will <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> suit </ERR> for the changes work.
Because some of them like the work that they do <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> really </ERR> , they decide to devote <ERR type=[fm1,-]> themselies </ERR> to the work.
But some of them just don't want to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> lost </ERR> the work to do another, they do it not <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> for </ERR> they like it.
Because they like challenge, they want to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> proved </ERR> that they can do any work if they like.
Because the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> characteries </ERR> of people is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffierent </ERR> , some like <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanlleage </ERR> and they want <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> to </ERR> the work they never <ERR type=[vp4,2-1]> to </ERR> do.
To our young people, we should <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> to </ERR> learn more and not just to be locked in the work we are.
Some think they always <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> work </ERR> the same surrounding, relationships and companions are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> familar </ERR> to them.
Maybe they like the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challeging </ERR> change.
I think there are advantages and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disavantays </ERR> in two ways.
If you feel present <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> isn't <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> satisfied </ERR> or you want to learn different <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> field </ERR> knowledge, you should change it as soon as possible.
At last, I hope everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> find </ERR> a job that you like as soon as possible.
What are the <ERR type=[np3,2-]> reason </ERR> for this?
The people who always <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> does </ERR> the same job usually <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> thinks </ERR> : <ERR type=[fm3,-]> In </ERR> his life, his income is stable, which means that he has a steady life, what he must do is concentrate his mind on his job, maybe, will be fruitful of his work.
<ERR type=[pr1,s-]> These </ERR> usually think, through <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> changing </ERR> to <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> , more various experience could be got by him.
It is also a problem <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> facing </ERR> to me that what kind of job I should choose.
In my opinion, changing jobs is very <ERR type=[fm2,-]> benefitful </ERR> for young <ERR type=[np6,1-]> person </ERR> , especially for the person like me, because this will make a person get more.
Some like to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> do </ERR> with the same job for good.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2]> By </ERR> practise <ERR type=[fm1,-]> longly </ERR> , they can master it and do it very well.
The other factor is that one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> find </ERR> a very good job or he likes it very much.
Others <ERR type=[fm1,-]> favorit </ERR> change the job <ERR type=[fm2,-]> oftenly </ERR> .
These people hope his life lively and their jobs <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challengable </ERR> .
But I think if someone changes his job more <ERR type=[fm2,-]> oftenly </ERR> , he couldn't do <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> them </ERR> well.
So I'm <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> for </ERR> stick <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> with </ERR> a job which <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> suit </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> you </ERR> very much and do it precisely.
I'll find out my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> favorit </ERR> job and devote my life to it.
Some people like to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> engaging </ERR> in a job consistently.
Especially, if you have <ERR type=[vp9,1-2]> studies </ERR> some certain subjects, you must want to do a relative job to testify how do you study.
<ERR type=[cj1,-s]> While </ERR> , other people prefer to <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> change </ERR> their jobs frequently.
I agree <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> with </ERR> the first opinion, ie.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,1-3]> like </ERR> do a job <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> from </ERR> begin to end.
Another reason is that they like stability and they think changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> is too tired.
They don't <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> make </ERR> themselves into troubles.
But the other one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,3-1]> change </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> constantly.
They <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> see how much are their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> abilitys </ERR> .
They <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> trying in various regions.
When we change jobs, we must think if it is suitable to <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> me </ERR> .
As soon as we find a job that we like and we are <ERR type=[aj4,-1]> interesting </ERR> in this scales, we should do it <ERR type=[fm2,-]> continuely </ERR> until we <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> contribute </ERR> ourselves.
Others also think that taking a stable job means he needn't worry about losing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> in a <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> respective </ERR> long time.
In a word, they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> focouse </ERR> on the stability.
However, someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to take a job for his life, because is afraid of <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> adopting </ERR> to the new working places.
Also, he hasn't the ability to receive new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technoledges </ERR> .
The reason may be that: the present work doesn't <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> suit </ERR> to him, and he thinks the job <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cann't </ERR> prove his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> abilitys </ERR> .
If the job is very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suitale </ERR> to me, why should I change the job?
Some people work <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> on </ERR> one job all their life, because they think there are many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benifits </ERR> in this.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> China, people who do not want to move their <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> jobs </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> all </ERR> always think the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> relatinship </ERR> with others, the house, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chirld </ERR> , so they are stable.
But some other people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> urually </ERR> work from one job to another.
They want to study more and have more friends, or they want to find the <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> well </ERR> place that they can work, or even they want to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> travl </ERR> from one city to another, one country to another by this way.
Because I <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> learn more about this world.
I think I can do well <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> by </ERR> this way.
Today, many people would like to do the same job all at <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> last </ERR> .
They think that a steady job will bring <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> him </ERR> a steady life.
But <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> another </ERR> people don't like steady <ERR type=[np6,2-]> job </ERR> .
Most of them want to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chang </ERR> their life through changing the job.
My view on job-hopping is to find a job <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> adapted </ERR> to myself by changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> consicently </ERR> and then <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> insist </ERR> it <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> on </ERR> my life, in order to realize my <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> order </ERR> in my life.
There is such a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> words </ERR> , "Happiness <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> consist </ERR> in work," so people all over the world like to work.
The attitude <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> the job, among them, can be divided into two groups.
One is the persons who take up a job for all his or <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> her </ERR> life, the other is the people who <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> enjoy </ERR> change jobs from time to time, from one place to another....
According to a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> questionaire </ERR> , the former group is one who is traditional.
Because we live in society, a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> steable </ERR> work may make our life comfortable.
You would not consider much <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> futher </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> everyday you are in good mood to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> go </ERR> work.
The second class may be called up up-to-date <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> persons </ERR> .
They like to meet <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> rather than <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> for one job for ever.
They think the value of man <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> consist </ERR> in overwhelming all the <ERR type=[fm1,-][cc3,3-]> difficities </ERR> and all the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> .
They think there are so many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opportunies </ERR> in their life.
In other words, their work full of <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> venture </ERR> , full of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> , full of interesting.
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opiny </ERR> , I should choose the one.
For a girl, I hope I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succedd </ERR> .
Some people <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> work <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> at </ERR> a sort of work in their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> work-life </ERR> .
Because they think people shouldn't change his work or <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> he </ERR> will work unsuccessfully.
The reason is people wouldn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> atention </ERR> on the work.
But, some people often <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> like </ERR> change their work <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> at </ERR> sometimes and <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> in </ERR> somewhere.
I had work at <ERR type=[fm1,-]> saleing </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> shopping </ERR> and teaching a pupil English and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mathimatic </ERR> .
I know some people and make <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> their </ERR> into my friend.
So, you have <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> listened </ERR> to me, if you were <ERR type=[pr4,s-]> I </ERR> , you wouldn't <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change your work frequently.
There <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> appear </ERR> some different points on job-hopping.
Others would like to change their jobs, perhaps because they like much <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> which shows their abilities.
[cc3,2-] I like <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> .
I think two jobs are <ERR type=[vp1,1-2]> fit </ERR> with me.
But I don't mean I go in for <ERR type=[pr4,s-]> they </ERR> at the same time.
I would like go in <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> for </ERR> a job for some years, then find another job which is a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> for me.
I think it not only train my <ERR type=[cc3,-]> ability </ERR> to <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> adapt </ERR> to the society but also proves my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> experence </ERR> ability.
I like <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .It is an opinion of one.
<ERR type=[np6,1-]> Job </ERR> is important to us.
They think, when one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> do </ERR> a job for a few years, he(she) would be skilled with the job, and in the following years, he(she)can do the job easily and <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> does </ERR> the job better <ERR type=[wd6,s-]> easily </ERR> .
Another kind of people <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> likes </ERR> to change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> now and then, when they do a job for some <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> times </ERR> , they have no interest in the job, and then they change their jobs.
<ERR type=[wd2,-]> Sometime </ERR> , people change their jobs only because they want to find a job with more pay.
As I said above, when one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> do </ERR> a job for some time, he(she) would be <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> similar </ERR> with the job.
On the contrary, if one often <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> change </ERR> his job, it is difficult for him to apply to the job at the beginning.
In their opinion, as a man who has <ERR type=[aj4,-1]> enterprised </ERR> heart, he should continue his course to the end no matter how tough it is.
They believe that where there is a will there is a way and that success belongs to those who can stick to his cause with perseverance <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> spirit </ERR> .
Because they like fresh <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> sense </ERR> and dislike to the same thing unceasingly.
They think that repeating one work is a dull thing, which will make them lose <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enegy </ERR> and desire <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> to </ERR> working, and it is important to have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enegy </ERR> and desire of work.
It is up to individual <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> decide </ERR> .
The most important thing for us is to take up the work we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> favoriat </ERR> and attain the aim that realize our personal social value and serve our country.
Some people <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> take a job for ever.
They feel that everything they do is very interesting, second, some of them think: their jobs are good enough and can earn good money, so they <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> needn't </ERR> to change them.
Third, some of them take their jobs they are good at, while other jobs are not <ERR type=[fm1,-]> familar </ERR> to them.
The other is they the jobs are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rountine </ERR> and they want some interesting and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challengeble </ERR> jobs to do.
For <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> , I think, we should first make a goal and we decide to do <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> for </ERR> it.
Therefore I want everyone like the job really, and do good for <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
It is due <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> for </ERR> they think that they can improve skill, accumulate experience, then lead to higher efficiency.
But some people don't think that, they would change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> usually </ERR> rather than stay in the same position or the same company.
Their causes are who engages in one job too long will tiresome, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> No </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> curiousity </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> No </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> freshment </ERR> , then people <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> feel </ERR> will lose passion gradually.
My view on job-hoping is that people should stay in the same company, which will <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> enhance </ERR> one skillful, acquaint with equipment technology and apparatus, so can bring sophisticated manipulating.
Usually changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> might not find the best position, but may make one no gain finally.
Some person liked to <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> work </ERR> about the same jobs.
They could work in the same <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> skills </ERR> .
Another <ERR type=[np3,1-]> persons </ERR> liked to change their jobs.
They thought they could find a better job from changing <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
They liked to learn more skills in different <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
I think it is important to us that we learn a job <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> skill </ERR> .
You can find <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wether </ERR> you like your work or not through a long time.
If you are sure that it is not fit for you, you may <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> change </ERR> a new job.
Nowadays, with the social reform and more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oppotunity </ERR> , more and more people have been changing their jobs frequently.
The reason of job-hopping may be <ERR type=[aj5,s-]> various </ERR> from <ERR type=[wd7,-]> poorly-paid </ERR> , bad wording condition to less challenging.
As everything has two sides, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> There </ERR> are also a large number of people, esp.
aged people, who <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> prefer </ERR> their present job rather than get a new one.
They enjoy the long-established relations around and dislike a totally strange <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviorment </ERR> .
My opinion is that; as long as the job is not suitable for you, I mean you can't use your talent and ability to the full <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> measure </ERR> or there isn't any hope for you to be promoted, surely you have the right to change <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> you </ERR> job.
But there is also a precondition <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ie </ERR> , whenever, you should work hard and try your best and then you have the right to say that the work isn't fit for you or is not worthwhile.
Otherwise, you don't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> deserv </ERR> any opportunity.
If someone <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> finds </ERR> the company worse in business, he will want to leave and look for another it.
These persons mainly consider <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> own income.
They say that the head of the company doesn't take care of them and these will lead the company to be <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> over </ERR> .
My idea is that if the company is advantage to develop us, we should not only look <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> upon </ERR> the money but we should work hard for <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
Every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> adults </ERR> is working every day.
On the other hand, some people <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> prefer </ERR> change their job constantly.
The reason is that they can maintain full energy in different <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envirements </ERR> .
What's more, new jobs are of a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanllege </ERR> to them.
In my opinion, these two thought are very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> commen </ERR> and understandable.
You may be like the first <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> one </ERR> .
Therefore, you have a good feeling to put into your job every day and result in a good <ERR type=[fm1,-]> achievment </ERR> .
You will realize your <ERR type=[fm1,-]> amibitious </ERR> during <ERR type=[fm1,-]> continous </ERR> changing.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> guees </ERR> that these thought may be more <ERR type=[wd3,-]> adaptable </ERR> to young person.
In the highly competitive market economy, most of us <ERR type=[vp3,3-][vp1,-1]> faces </ERR> with the difficulty of getting a job.
Finding a job is not only a <ERR type=[fm2,-]> challengement </ERR> but also a chance to <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> testing </ERR> our abilities.
They think that it is not easy to <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> grasping </ERR> skills.
Stable job can make them <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> be </ERR> more familiar with <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviornment </ERR> so that they may do it very well, many of us agree <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> with </ERR> this idea.
The traditional thoughts greatly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> influene </ERR> us now.
In my opinion to <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> this </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> As </ERR> with every problem, there are two sides about this.
Engaging in doing one job in one's life is as <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> not </ERR> favorable as changing jobs frequently.
One must think carefully when she or he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to get a new job.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Diffirent </ERR> people <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> has </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffirent </ERR> job-hopping <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acording </ERR> to their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffirent </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chericters </ERR> .
Some people <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> prefers </ERR> a job <ERR type=[wd3,-4]> in </ERR> which he would devote all his life <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> in </ERR> just because his loved the job.
This kind of person <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comon </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cherictoristics </ERR> that they are <ERR type=[aj5,s-]> thorough </ERR> in doing their jobs and they don't like the changed positions in their lives.
This kind of person <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perfer </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanlenge </ERR> life.
They always looking for a job which has better conditions and the higher <ERR type=[fm1,-]> selories </ERR> .
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opinon </ERR> , I want a job which suits me best.
Because jobs are not only the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> methord </ERR> depending on which you will survive but also a way you will put you ideal into <ERR type=[fm2,-]> realistics </ERR> .
So you must love this job when you do it and you can do something which is really <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benefical </ERR> to our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> soceirty </ERR> .
No <ERR type=[fm1,-]> metter </ERR> whether you will change your job, loving your job is more important.
If you love it, you will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> proberly </ERR> step on the road which leads to your success.
Some people like to do one job all their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lifes </ERR> .
Second I think some of these people are not willing to change their jobs though they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> proberbly </ERR> dislike their jobs.
Because these people have much ambition and thy want to <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> show </ERR> themselves and want to achieve <ERR type=[fm2,-]> somethings </ERR> .
Before I get a job I must <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> make </ERR> me to be a useful and skilled men.
On the other hand, if the job isn't <ERR type=[aj4,-1]> excited </ERR> to me I will <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> consider </ERR> to change one.
Thus, we cannot often change our job and when we become older and older we can do a lot and do <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> successful </ERR> .
These are my <ERR type=[np3,1-]> view </ERR> on Job-Hopping.
So there are many different views on Job-Hopping in people.Some people like to take only one job in his <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> all </ERR> life for they would not like to move from one place to another and they could have a stable income.
Some people would like to change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> from time to time, for they like to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> recept </ERR> challenge and make their life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> instresting </ERR> .
My view on job-hopping is different <ERR type=[aj2,1-]> with </ERR> the people that have <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> mentioned </ERR> .
I like to change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> several years when I start to work, but not <ERR type=[fm2,-]> oftenly </ERR> .
From the challenge I could <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inhance </ERR> my capacity and experience.
When over forty, I would choose one job that I like best to take and take it until I retire, so that I could have a stable life in the <ERR type=[wd1,-1]> left </ERR> time.
I would be very glad if you have the same view with me and I hope everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> their own view on Job-Hopping and each of them has a good life.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Allmost </ERR> everyone has a job.
Some like doing a job in <ERR type=[pr3,6-]> his </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> holelife </ERR> , some <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change <ERR type=[pr3,3-]> his </ERR> job as <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> he </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> .
Those who like doing a job in his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> holelife </ERR> because <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> he </ERR> like the job.
They know <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exectly </ERR> what they are and their own <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fellings </ERR> .
They do not want to be in the world <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unknow </ERR> .
And some <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change their jobs have some kind of view.
They <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> maybe </ERR> do not like the job they are doing.
They <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> maybe </ERR> want to challenge themselves.
They <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> maybe </ERR> want to be <ERR type=[wd2,-]> high </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> payed </ERR> .
They <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> maybe </ERR> want to live in different <ERR type=[np6,3-]> place </ERR> .
Maybe they are the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> felling </ERR> .
They trust their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> felling </ERR> , Maybe there are something <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unknow </ERR> .
But if I do not get the job I like, I <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> maybe </ERR> change the job.
If the job I do is not the job I like I still be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> remine </ERR> if they do need me.
There are some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> responsbilities </ERR> you can not <ERR type=[fm1,-]> foget </ERR> .
But they will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> effiently </ERR> with <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> time </ERR> on.
They are used to doing some kind of work and are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disvadtage </ERR> than the other.
Once work is changed, they are often that they can not adjust <ERR type=[fm1,-]> themslve </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,-s]> Other </ERR> like to change work.
To them, it is <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,-]> enjoy </ERR> when do some different jobs.
They are <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> tiresome </ERR> of working a single job long time.
But if one does a single job in his life, he can not study more, and enlarge his <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> skills </ERR> .
I think that one should do the job that he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> , if his condition <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> change </ERR> , he may find other work.
Since they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> recived </ERR> one job.
He <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> looks </ERR> the job his second life and devote <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> all </ERR> himself <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> into </ERR> the work.
He works very hard, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> foucucing </ERR> all his attentions on the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> factor </ERR> , throwing his <ERR type=[cc3,-]> sweat </ERR> on the field and seldom.
This kind of people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cann't </ERR> do better in their life.
Another <ERR type=[np3,1-]> kinds </ERR> of people like to change their work frequently.
Their life-long period, they can't know what's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> achieviment </ERR> but they may get full experience in their life.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> On </ERR> my opinion, I do these two kind of people and not do them too.
In my <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> former </ERR> life I change my work to get experience and in my later life-time.
I do in one <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> word </ERR> to get <ERR type=[fm1,-]> achievenment </ERR> .
Today, with the development of society, all kinds of jobs are constantly <ERR type=[vp1,s-][fm1,-]> occured </ERR> .
So everyone has some chances to choose <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> itself </ERR> job.
Because they like the job more than else <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> others </ERR> ; they want to devote themselves the working; they want to gain some great <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucess </ERR> in this aspect.
They type of people has <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> only belief.
They believe that they <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> looking <ERR type=[vp1,1-2]> for </ERR> themselves <ERR type=[fm2,-]> valueness </ERR> from all kinds of jobs and attempts.
The type of people can soon <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> adopt </ERR> to all kinds of different <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envirmental </ERR> .
They believed that they have some ability to <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> adopt </ERR> to the society.
So they attempt to work on all kinds of jobs to <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> check </ERR> themselves.
But I believe that every one should have <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> itself </ERR> belief.
As we step into the society, maybe we can't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> recive </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> agreeable job, but we shouldn't give up, we finally find <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> agreeable job to <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> fit </ERR> for itself.
But as we find the job, we should insist <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> it, we should devote ourselves to it and gain some success by our working.
My view on job <ERR type=[fm3,4-2]> Hopping </ERR> is that has a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fittness </ERR> job.
I want to look for a good job, then I will devote myself <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> into </ERR> it.
Some people like to do the same work all life, because they consider that they can do the work <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> skilled </ERR> by long time training.
And they needn't <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> adapt </ERR> to another new job.
So they have enough time to do other <ERR type=[np6,1-]> thing </ERR> they like.
I think that the career one person <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> work </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> is defined by his <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> characteristic </ERR> .
Once you like your work, you will all <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> through </ERR> keep up with doing it.
Because I <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> think </ERR> it important to do their best to do well in what they should do.
Somebody <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> their work, even they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conviece </ERR> it as the best important thing in their life.
Even though, there are many people who would like to <ERR type=[wd1,-3]> often </ERR> change their work.
In order to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> abtain </ERR> many more chances, they will select another work with no <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hestate </ERR> .
My view on Job-Hopping is that only you think you need a new condition, you are going to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> creat </ERR> it, if you <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> think </ERR> it not necessary, you'd better stay in the place where you stayed at first.
I think that chance is all in our heads if we make good use of our chance, we will "go" <ERR type=[fm1,-]> further </ERR> .
Some people like to <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> engage </ERR> a kind of job all their lives, because they considered that the same job could permit them to do the job with enough <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> times </ERR> , for example a man might started his cooking carrier when he was young.
As a result he may develop his cooking skills <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> after </ERR> years, also he got guys from his job.
Second a man <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prefered </ERR> to do a job because to which is the most one he (or she ) wanted to devoted themselves; a teacher may <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> had </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> instuctor </ERR> as the objective of his life, a policeman <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> regard </ERR> defeating crime as his own duty... all the above are just the second case.
They think it is full of challenge to do the new work <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> well </ERR> , also a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> larish </ERR> experience of one's career offers plenty of knowledge for him.
My view on job-hopping is that the job we <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> engaging </ERR> must <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> fit </ERR> in our interest at first.
Somebody would like to do the same work all <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> ways </ERR> , because he hopes that he will be a specific expert in one field.
According to them, if you focus on your work, you will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> achive </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> greatment </ERR> .
The other of <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> them </ERR> believe that new <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enchance </ERR> them.
Because I believe that only if <ERR type=[wd1,-1]> have </ERR> I enough <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acknolagy </ERR> , I could <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> access </ERR> in my field.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Therefor </ERR> , I will work hard in one field all <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> ways </ERR> , then I can get enough <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acknology </ERR> about my field.
Today, my country is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rebuting </ERR> , and requires specific <ERR type=[np6,3-]> expert </ERR> , so I have chance to do <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> those </ERR> .
To Job-Hopping, there are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> defferent </ERR> views one from one, I think.
Firstly, he is satisfied with the current job, for its high wages, good conditions as <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> well </ERR> , moreover, it is challenging to him.
The reasons, by contrast, are that the job isn't suitable for him, or he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to prove his ability, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dispite </ERR> the good conditions of the current job.
My view is that if he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> enough ability and courage, he can change <ERR type=[wd4,-]> his </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> certainly </ERR> , but he must think it over in advance, because it is an important thing to him or his family.
In order to <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> life </ERR> , any adult needs to have a job.
There are two views about how to work: The first, some one likes to do only <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> a </ERR> job all his life.
Because he <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> likes </ERR> live a <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> stability </ERR> life; Because he is highly responsible.
The second, some one likes to <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> work </ERR> from one job to another frequently.
He also has his reason <ERR type=[wd5,-2]> for </ERR> to do so.
He <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to live an <ERR type=[fm2,-]> uncalm </ERR> life.
He thinks that doing this kind of job is <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> adventure </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> stimulatous </ERR> .
Compared with <ERR type=[np8,-4]> that </ERR> two kinds of men, I'd like to do as the first man, I think that a man should have a spirit of loving his job.
So we should do a job and contribute all our lives <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> for </ERR> it.
<ERR type=[vp4,-s]> Do </ERR> one job gives them more chances to train themselves in technology and skill.
<ERR type=[vp4,-s]> Do </ERR> one job can train us <ERR type=[np3,1-]> specialist </ERR> in this field.
Some people like to have one <ERR type=[np3,1-]> kinds </ERR> of jobs in <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> life.
They may <ERR type=[fm1,-]> feverite </ERR> the job or they have special kill on this job or they can do nothing if they leave the work.
Sometimes they may word as a teacher but when you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> letter </ERR> meet him he <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> maybe </ERR> is a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> manger </ERR> in a company.
They always think the job they used to do is not <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> suit </ERR> for him, or can not express his <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> capacity </ERR> .
So they give up <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> it </ERR> and find a new one.
Because once we find a job it may <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> not </ERR> the best for us.
Only through the change of job may we find the most <ERR type=[fm1,-]> propriate </ERR> job.
Some people like to do the same kind of job from beginning to <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> end.
There are some reasons for this, first, those people who can do a particular job very well <ERR type=[wd5,2-]> always </ERR> feel happy when they do it, second, some people like the lifestyle of some what <ERR type=[fm1,-]> coincise </ERR> , they do not like to make themselves too busy, and do not want to face frustration other jobs bring to them.
Others like to do different jobs, these people are always active, full of energy, and they think do different kinds of jobs can make their life always full of freshness, and so that they enjoy different <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happyness </ERR> .
In my opinion, people should do different <ERR type=[np3,1-]> kind </ERR> of jobs.
Life for us is only <ERR type=[aj5,s-]> once </ERR> , we shouldn't live through it indifferently.
If you do only one job, how do you know what all <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> of </ERR> you can do?
Yet this kind of condition is very <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> few </ERR> .
Different people have different <ERR type=[np3,1-]> view </ERR> on Job-Hopping.
Some people would rather devote <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> himself </ERR> to one job.
If you do many jobs in the <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> limit </ERR> time, you don't do only one job well enough and you are difficult to make progress.
When one has been doing a job for a long time, <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> we </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> will </ERR> tired of it and <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> has </ERR> a low spirit.
If he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> a new job, his spirit <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> get </ERR> high, and can do the job well easily.
I consider that, one should devote himself <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> into </ERR> one job, and do it well, in order to get the top of the field quickly and make large <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> progresses </ERR> .
But you also <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> must </ERR> know something of other <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
If your job is lost one day, you could enter other <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> job </ERR> easily.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to take one job for his life.
Such people are almost pushy job- <ERR type=[fm2,-]> takers </ERR> and they like their job very much.
They sometimes dedicate their <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> most </ERR> time to developing their job.
However, some people like to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chang </ERR> their job frequently.
Such people are almost <ERR type=[vp9,4-][vp1,-s]> look </ERR> the job less important than the salary.
We not only make money <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> on </ERR> it , but obtain much interest from <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
We should take <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> carefully.
<ST 4> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <AGE ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 1> <WAY 1> <SCH 2745> <TITLE My View on Job-Hopping> <SCORE 9> <ID 440722>Many people are always having the same job for many years even for all their life time, especially of the old man and woman, perhaps it's because they like the steady <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rythem </ERR> such as the regular working time, the working conditions or the steady salary.
On the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> countrary </ERR> some people always the young man <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chang </ERR> their jobs <ERR type=[pp2,-3]> for </ERR> time to time.
The society is <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> in </ERR> developing fast and many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> chance </ERR> we can have, why don't go out the old job for a new challenging one?
But others <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pefer </ERR> to change work some <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> times </ERR> , they all their reason to support their view.
They think they take a same job for long time, they will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> familar </ERR> with their job.
In a word, they <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> think </ERR> it better to have a kind of stable job.
To the second kind of man, often changing job is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> alert </ERR> .
Because they have many chances to show their <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> ability </ERR> .
They also think that it is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chaningable </ERR> to take all kinds of job.
They are going to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> adventure </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Everthing </ERR> has two sides.
Because our society needs <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sythenic </ERR> ability <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> man </ERR> , we should study hard in order to <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> adapt </ERR> to the development of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> economition </ERR> .
In general, people can be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> seprated </ERR> into two groups.
One group <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to do one job forever.
Because they <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> think </ERR> it possible for them to become experts in the field they are working in, and they can make good <ERR type=[fm1,-]> freids </ERR> with others.
But another group <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to change their jobs <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frenquently </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> To </ERR> my view, I like the first group.
China has a <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> says </ERR> " When doing a job, then love it".
Because people have limited energy, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> you </ERR> should focus on one thing then you may succeed.
If you do many jobs <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> in </ERR> short time, you will never succeed.
We know the number of types of <ERR type=[np3,2-]> job </ERR> is very large.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> different </ERR> man does different job.
People's views on job-Hopping <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> not </ERR> same.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> will do well in the jobs.
They <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> acquaint </ERR> them and have some skills.
If they turn to do other jobs, they have no experience in doing <ERR type=[wd1,-1]> well </ERR> them, they don't understand them, they will not feel <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> favourable </ERR> .
But some people like to turn to do other jobs, they enjoy challenging themselves, they will gain different joy from a new job, they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> possiblely </ERR> work better in the new position.
So I think I will not turn to other <ERR type=[np3,1-]> job </ERR> when I find a good one, but, if the job is not suitable to me.
Many people like to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> going </ERR> in for a job because they like stationary life and do not want to change the environment they <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> were </ERR> living.
Also they <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> interest </ERR> in this job.
Another reason is <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> maybe </ERR> they aren't <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> satisfactory </ERR> of their salaries, their working conditions or other <ERR type=[np3,6-]> factor </ERR> .
Before hunting a job you should make <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> certain </ERR> your special field and your interest, they are both important.
From our childhood we <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> began </ERR> on studying.
You should see <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> to </ERR> your selection and then learning in your filed.
Your learning may be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> infuluenced </ERR> by your interest.
After this, you should consider many factors <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> to </ERR> your job hunting, then decide to select one job for you.
But one job you selected is often not <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> be </ERR> the best for you, you should put your heart into it to make the job best.
All the job you want <ERR type=[vp3,s-][vp9,s-]> don't </ERR> always be the one you wanted.
The <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> period </ERR> is changing very fast you should insist <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> learning .
<ERR type=[vp4,-s]> Learn </ERR> from books, from the people surrounding you, this will benefit you, so I like to work <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> my interest and be stationary.
Everyone has his view on <ERR type=[fm1,-]> varies </ERR> job-hopping.
Somebody <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> taking one job all along.
These people love quiet, <ERR type=[wd4,2-]> stable </ERR> , and they don't want to go anywhere.
Other people often change their job, because they like <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanllege </ERR> .
They want to overcome <ERR type=[np6,1-]> difficulty </ERR> and want to <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> defeat </ERR> themselves.
I belong to the second sort <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> as </ERR> <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> we </ERR> mentioned in the last paragraph.
<ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> In </ERR> present society, anybody who is a man would not live without money.
I have many dreams, but I also have to <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> take </ERR> the society.
I love work and I like <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanllege </ERR> .
If one job can verify one's <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> value </ERR> , I would chose this job.
We would face very many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffculties </ERR> when we change our <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> works </ERR> .
But we can't give up, or you are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> failurer </ERR> .
We may adjust ourselves to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> adoput </ERR> the new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviroment </ERR> .
We <ERR type=[fm1,-]> woke </ERR> hard or we study hard, which is good to us.
Though society is complex, we live with <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> oneself </ERR> , for oneself, and we can defeat oneself, at last we think the society is so simple.
There are some people who like going in for a job from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> begaining </ERR> to end.
They think changing of jobs will let them <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> not </ERR> work efficiently.
During the young <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> time </ERR> , they learned <ERR type=[wd5,-2]> a </ERR> specialized knowledge.
When they went into society, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> this </ERR> entitled them the ability to work.
But some people think that it is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> no </ERR> interesting for them to work only <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> one job.
They <ERR type=[wd1,-s]> more </ERR> like changing work from time to time, only in this way, work can be interesting.
During the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> colledge </ERR> <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> time, </ERR> they learned a lot of knowledge, not focused in one side , and they didn't like the specialize knowledge they learned in college.
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oppion </ERR> , I will go in for a job through my life, but I will still go in for a lot of amateur job, this will make me live more <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> comfortable </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suceed </ERR> in working for the people.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> because </ERR> we can do the job fast without any thinking.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> above </ERR> all it is helpful for improving <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technolog </ERR> .But some people <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> often .Because he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to find a better job(He <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> the job and the job is <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> fitted </ERR> for him.
) some people <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> because he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to master many kinds of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technolog </ERR> .
Because we change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> often, people will think we can't do <ERR type=[wd1,-1]> well </ERR> everything.
We can't get well with <ERR type=[vp2,3-]> on </ERR> the people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aroud </ERR> us.
But when we <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> need </ERR> change a job <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> insure </ERR> we should change it with a lot of thinking.
Everyone has <ERR type=[pr1,2-]> its </ERR> own view on everything, and also on job-hopping.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to do <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> same job as possible as he could.
Because, to him, the familiar <ERR type=[fm1,-]> circumbrance </ERR> , the old friends and the pleasure of his family are the most important.
But there is another kind of person who <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change jobs at times.
He likes new conditions, new faces and even new <ERR type=[fm2,-]> challengments </ERR> .
I like to do the same <ERR type=[fm2,-]> entertainments </ERR> with same old friends and go to a same bar to have a drink.
They like new things and like taking <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> adventure </ERR> .
They will find <ERR type=[fm1,-]> varity </ERR> of pleasure from different jobs.
I <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> find pleasure from many ways.
In our society if one man <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> want </ERR> to live or live better, he must have a job to do.
Only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> throug </ERR> working he <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> can </ERR> get money to buy what he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> need </ERR> .
First, doing the same job, special <ERR type=[np6,1-]> skill </ERR> needed is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> constant </ERR> , they don't have to learn other skills.
But some people like to change their jobs, just because they think that doing <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> variable </ERR> jobs can exercise their ability and choosing good jobs also can enable them to get much money.
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> vives </ERR> , I support the former, every one energy is limited.
We want to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contribut </ERR> to the society and we can do a job well, which is the best way.
In our large <ERR type=[fm1,-]> county </ERR> , if many people change their job, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> continally </ERR> the society problems will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> occure </ERR> .
For <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> our </ERR> college students, since we have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> choose </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> professionl </ERR> field, we had better engage in the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> specialize </ERR> and do it well as possible as we can in the future.
In short, I appreciate the people who <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> divide </ERR> his life to a job.
<ERR type=[np3,s-]> Every </ERR> people have a different working <ERR type=[np3,3-]> ways </ERR> .
Some are content to go in for a job for <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lifes </ERR> .
Because they expect to assure the stability of his position and salary, which is considered as a common sense.Some are inclined to shift <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> continously </ERR> .
Because they always <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> seek </ERR> for <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> a </ERR> ideal condition, which can provide him more chances to exert their abilities.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2]> On </ERR> my view, a variety of working ways is not most important for every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> people </ERR> , the importance is if we can dedicate our <ERR type=[fm2,-]> knowledges </ERR> to the society and promote human being's <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> progress </ERR> .
As a result, I think that Job-Hopping is only a kind of form of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sevicing </ERR> for society.
Some of the people would devote themselves to one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unchungable </ERR> job, the reason perhaps is that the job is their own aim and they like and want to go in for it with their all lives.
About this question, my view on job-hopping may be the following three points: The first one, you should get a job you like or <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> be </ERR> interested in, then you work for it with your soul and heart, for one person should do some things for society more or less.
In your job, you must practice and <ERR type=[vp1,2-]> achieve </ERR> .
If we don't make much <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> good </ERR> , but change jobs, I think it is no good for <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> yourself </ERR> and any people.
Some people like only one kind of job all his life, because they think since <ERR type=[pr3,-]> he </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> find </ERR> a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> favorate </ERR> job, he should not change it.
They don't like always <ERR type=[fm2,-]> changeing </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> works </ERR> .
There are too many <ERR type=[fm2,-]> terribles </ERR> , they think.
Generally speaking, the characteristics of this kind is single and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> inter-type </ERR> .
On the other hand, there <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> are </ERR> another group of people, who like various work.
They like <ERR type=[fm1,-]> changeing </ERR> jobs in order to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> try </ERR> on various of jobs in the world.
And this kind of men is very lively and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> outer-type </ERR> .
Because I'm an <ERR type=[fm2,-]> outer-type </ERR> person, changing work sometimes to improve myself is my choice.
Some people like doing <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> same job all life, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> but </ERR> some people like changing their jobs often.
The two kinds of people both have <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> their </ERR> ---The first kind <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> their jobs very much, and they want to do something in their field.
For example, a person who likes music is doing music work, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> the music too much to change his job, and he will do this job all life.
Or some people want to change the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviorment </ERR> and find a good job.
So they change their jobs <ERR type=[fm1,-]> obstantly </ERR> .
My view on job-hopping is: When you like your job, you should do it hard; but when you don't like your job, you can change a job that <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> meet </ERR> you.
With the development of society, people's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> attituds </ERR> to jobs are changing greatly.
The reasons for this are that they love their job very much or they might think they are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> familar </ERR> with the job and have enough experiences for the job.
Even if they are somewhat unsuitable to it, they <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> convince </ERR> that they will do it well soon.
By changing, they will gain interests, and work in a comfortable <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envirement </ERR> .
Some of them also change their jobs for income or relationship when their income is not enough to meet the requirement of their family, they have to find a new job when they don't get along well with their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> workmates </ERR> or leaders, they also need to get a new job.
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opnion </ERR> , people may take part time jobs according to their interests.
By doing so, their life will be more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happly </ERR> .
Those who like doing the only job that they <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> devote </ERR> to think that the job is an important part of their lives.
They are always <ERR type=[fm2,-1]> conservational </ERR> people.
They hate job-hopping because they think the job-hoppings can't <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> do </ERR> their works carefully and <ERR type=[wd2,-]> hardly </ERR> .
But the job-hoppings regard that job-hopping make their lives more vivid, and they get more experiences when they have done so many <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> works </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> To </ERR> my opinion, I prefer devoting myself to one job.
But if I <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> devote </ERR> to one job, I can manage to make my life.
They change <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> them </ERR> in order to learn something new and learn new <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> abilities </ERR> .
Some <ERR type=[np6,-s]> ones </ERR> likes to do <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> a </ERR> kind of job all <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> throng </ERR> <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> life.
They think that the job is good and they are <ERR type=[aj2,1-1]> familiar </ERR> in it .They have the good ways.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> importainest </ERR> is they don't like <ERR type=[np6,1-]> change </ERR> .
Some <ERR type=[np6,1-2]> ones </ERR> likes to change their job usually.
They will learn to adopt many different <ERR type=[np3,2-]> job </ERR> and get well along with many different people.
And they think that often <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> change </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> will let them study more, and also can improve <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> theirs </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> capities </ERR> .
My view on <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Job-Hopping </ERR> is that I will do the job that I am <ERR type=[vp5,1-1]> interest </ERR> in.
The interest is most <ERR type=[fm1,-][aj3,1-]> importanest </ERR> .
I also <ERR type=[vp1,2-2]> like </ERR> change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> , it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> challenge.
It can make my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> experiementes </ERR> become abound.
Maybe, I will do a kind of job or change <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> main </ERR> job, but I will do my best!
Some people want to go in for one work for good, because they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> that man must do <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> and like it.
Furthermore, they <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> maybe </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> decline </ERR> to live a standing <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> life </ERR> and avoid the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unfamilar </ERR> fields.
On the other hand, some people like <ERR type=[wd1,-3]> often </ERR> change their work.
Firstly, they can <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> touch </ERR> in all kinds of new things, and they can come along <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> with </ERR> lots of people.
Secondly, their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> charator </ERR> of activity <ERR type=[vp3,s-][wd3,s-]> decide </ERR> they can't take <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> in </ERR> one work otherwise, they feel poor.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> On </ERR> my opinion, one person <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> do </ERR> one work <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> good </ERR> or often <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> change </ERR> it, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> consider </ERR> his need <ERR type=[fm1,-]> corrdingly </ERR> , we can't say two habits which is right or which is better.
When individual <ERR type=[np6,1-]> person </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> feel </ERR> his life is right, <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> they </ERR> will have a good time.
Because, it can insure stable living <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> resource </ERR> .
One can improve <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> owner </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technolgy </ERR> in the field of the job.
By studying the knowledge of the job, one's ability <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> become </ERR> more skilled.
[cc2,s-] This efficiency will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enhence </ERR> .
Firstly once they find the job is not suitable for <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> him </ERR> , they will want to change the job.
Secondly, they think that changing job is a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challege </ERR> for them.
I will go in for it for ever and <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> fit </ERR> for it.
But how can we <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> should </ERR> do.
Some one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to do one job for <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> a </ERR> long.
Because they think that can <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> make </ERR> to gain achievements.
Some one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to change their jobs frequently.
Because this makes them find a job that <ERR type=[vp3,3-][vp1,-1]> fit </ERR> for them at last.
Because the job <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> is </ERR> fit for us or not is concerned to our success.
If we are at a work that we do not like, we will be not interested in it and can not do it <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> good </ERR> .
So when we find the job <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> do </ERR> not <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> fit </ERR> for us, we must try another one.
Some people may like to change <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> job.
Changing job may give them many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> chance </ERR> to study more <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> knowledge </ERR> and accumulate <ERR type=[np8,-1]> much </ERR> experiences.
My <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> write </ERR> on job-hopping is that whether changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> is not important.
Only if I like <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> , and the job may give me much enjoyment.
I <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> hope </ERR> got a job which is suitable what I have read.
Some people like to work the same <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> job </ERR> for ever.
Because they feel if they change the jobs frequently, they will <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> no </ERR> succeed any job.
I think these two kinds of attitudes <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> all </ERR> have their benefits.
When I am young, before I find the job I like best, I can do many kinds of jobs, training myself ,and get <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> difference </ERR> kinds of abilities.
But when I find the job I'm favor to, I will devote myself <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> into </ERR> it, will succeed soon.
Some people like to do a job in <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> life.
Some people like to change their job, because they <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> read </ERR> a better job or they don't like to do a job in a long time.
I like to do a job in my life, because I think a job contains many things, such as knowledge and <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> mind </ERR> .
In order to do the best, I will do a job all <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> in </ERR> my life.
On the other hand, someone else <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> insist </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> alternative </ERR> work that they prefer <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> to </ERR> .
Because they are looking forward to better <ERR type=[np6,1-]> life </ERR> , rather than the single life.
In a word, they'd like to risk something that they <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> didn't </ERR> experience.In my opinion, I'd like to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> pursuit </ERR> a single work.
I believe I can <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> achieve </ERR> after with my confidence all along.
They can get <ERR type=[np8,-1]> much </ERR> experiences <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> to </ERR> these jobs.
So they can master <ERR type=[np8,-1]> much </ERR> skills.
Some people like to change their jobs because they like to <ERR type=[fm2,-]> advent </ERR> .
They like to live a splendid life.In my opinion, I like to change my job frequently because I want to get much <ERR type=[np8,1-]> experiences </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> to </ERR> all kinds of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> job </ERR> and master <ERR type=[np8,-1]> much </ERR> skills.
Some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bodys </ERR> like to do a work in a long time, because they do not like to face new challenge.Some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bodys </ERR> like to change jobs, because they like to face new adventure.
In my mind, I will work <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> a job for a long time ever all my life, if I like it.
If I work <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> a job that I do not like, then I will intend to change, until I get the job which like.
Some of the rest people like to change work frequently, because they have <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> variable </ERR> interests and they will try their best to find which one can bring them complete success.
Between two of the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> front </ERR> , I agree with the first.
I have only one purpose-being a boss who <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> have </ERR> a famous firm.
This aim <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> isn't </ERR> change ever since my boyhood.
Some people like to go on the same work in their lives, they say only the same work, you can learn more knowledge, and you would do your best, because work <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> need </ERR> the long time to study, while you have short time.
You can't do <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> scientists </ERR> .
If they <ERR type=[vp9,-s]> didn't </ERR> spent the long time ,ever their lives, they couldn't do anything in science.
But some people don't agree <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> with </ERR> the opinion, they like to change their work.
Some work <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> need </ERR> long time to do.
But <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> to </ERR> work people have many <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> various </ERR> different views.
They are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> customed </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,3-3]> to </ERR> do the same thing once and they are not fit for the variety of work.However some like to change work constantly.
To me, my view on job-hopping is what job could fit me to do, and my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> abates </ERR> is enough to do it <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> good </ERR> .
I will enjoy taking <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> it.Fits </ERR> is the most important things on one's job-hopping.
Some people <ERR type=[vp1,2-4]> prefer </ERR> to doing a kind of job from start to end, because they like the stable surrounding, that is to say, day by day more experience can be got.Others may <ERR type=[vp1,2-4]> prefer </ERR> to changing jobs frequently.
They have passion, <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> hearty </ERR> and barrette.
They <ERR type=[vp1,1-5]> prefer </ERR> to fresh things rather than old ones.
So changing jobs can give them a challenge to meet.My opinion is that <ERR type=[vp4,-s]> do </ERR> what I'm interested in.
If you don't like to do or have no <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> interests </ERR> , you may not have impulse to do it.
That is why many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> employer </ERR> may ask <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> employ </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-2]> such </ERR> the same question-what do you like to do?
Someone <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> likes </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> do </ERR> same job all his life.
Because he thinks that the same job of <ERR type=[fm2,-]> long-period </ERR> will make him more skilled than others.
He thinks that the same kind of work <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> limit </ERR> his that thought and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> emanation </ERR> , but different jobs will give him different knowledge and they will help him do better than others.
Some people <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> do <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> same job from start to the end.
They can enjoy the success from doing the same work better and better.While some others often <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change the job.
Because they want to <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> touch </ERR> with the new thing and new people.
This <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> their life more <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> well </ERR> .My view on job-hopping is do the same job.
I can get more <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> successfully </ERR> .
After all, a man's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> capital </ERR> is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> limit </ERR> , I can not study all the skills very well.
Somebody always <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> like </ERR> to do a kind of work because they think that the work is best.
The work <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> them happy.
So they always do it.Some body <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> job-hopping.
After they always do the same work, they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> that the work is boring.
The work <ERR type=[vp9,-2]> is </ERR> not suit for them.
My view on job-hopping is that I do what I like.If a kind of work <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> make </ERR> me unhappy or <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> make </ERR> me feel <ERR type=[aj4,1-]> boring </ERR> , I will give it up.
I will <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> to </ERR> find what I like.
I don't have much chance of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> choice </ERR> work.
Some people <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> like </ERR> work on a job <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> seat </ERR> .
They don't <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> like </ERR> change work environment.
There <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> are </ERR> same people <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> work </ERR> with them, so they can help each other.
Then the work can <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> finish </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> queenly </ERR> .
Every <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> a </ERR> new job can bring him new friends.
They must <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> suit </ERR> for the new work so they have to learn new <ERR type=[np6,1-]> skill </ERR> .
Some people change work because they <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> have more money or have higher job <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> seat </ERR> .
To do a work best is not easy, we must spend <ERR type=[np8,-1]> many </ERR> time to do it.
Change a job, we will begin a new <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> objection </ERR> .
Change so many work is not good for us do <ERR type=[np6,1-]> thing </ERR> well.
Some people <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> like </ERR> do <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> same job for long time.
So they don't spend much time in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> studding </ERR> how to work well.
So they don't adjust <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> himself </ERR> to go on with a new job.
I think they like a smooth life.Some people like to change their job with <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> him </ERR> .
If they find that the job isn't <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> fitted </ERR> with <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> him </ERR> , they'll change to other job quickly.
Because they want to find a job which is <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> fitted </ERR> himself mostly.
So they can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> showed </ERR> their ability.
They like to have new <ERR type=[np6,1-]> thing </ERR> in the job every day, don't like the same thing in the job.
I can do a job in <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> less </ERR> ten years.
After several years I'll have a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bass </ERR> in my job.I think I'll change my job <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> less </ERR> ten times in <ERR type=[wd1,-1]> my </ERR> all life.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> doing one job and never change because they want a still life.
They don't <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> like </ERR> go here or there from time to time or they are afraid of new living situation.
This kind of men don't seem to <ERR type=[np6,-s]> succeed.Other </ERR> like often changing their jobs because they don't like a life never changing.
They want to see new things and different <ERR type=[fm1,-]> felling </ERR> .
My view on job-hopping is that seize every <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opptunity </ERR> you can if you want to succeed.
If you change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> only for your pressure, you will never succeed, and come down to the world.
And don't <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> container </ERR> your job if there's other good job waiting for you.
You <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> maybe </ERR> lose a chance to come up to the world for your newer changing.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> going </ERR> in for a kind of work only because they are most <ERR type=[aj4,-1]> interesting </ERR> in it, they are tired <ERR type=[pp1,2-2]> of </ERR> change a job frequently.
They are used to <ERR type=[vp5,3-]> do </ERR> his favorite job and enjoy it.Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> changing </ERR> his job frequently because his hobby is <ERR type=[cc4,2-]> wide </ERR> , and he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> receive </ERR> new things and enjoy it, this <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> help </ERR> him to improve his experience and skill.
I think I belong to the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> behead </ERR> one.
That they know better about the job will make <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> their </ERR> succeed in their work.
They can use the knowledge they just learned from a job <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> into </ERR> the next job.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> any job needed a diligent person.
The issue of employment has always been the concerning focus of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wholl </ERR> society.
The time is going on and people's view on job-hopping <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> are </ERR> changing too.
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Easten </ERR> World, such as China, Japan, most people hold this opinion.
These people aren't <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> pleasant </ERR> to change.
All they want or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persuit </ERR> is a stable and <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> peace </ERR> life.
So they do a job only to earn money to <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> leave </ERR> on, even they don't <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> interested </ERR> in what they're doing.
Unlike the people <ERR type=[fm2,-]> above-mentioned </ERR> , some persons change their job <ERR type=[fm1,-]> constently </ERR> .
They more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persuit </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> stimulativity </ERR> .
Besides they hope their job to be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanllegable </ERR> , so that they can show their <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> capacity </ERR> adequately.
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opionion </ERR> , people have free right to <ERR type=[vp5,4-2]> chose </ERR> a job.
In <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> keen </ERR> competitive society, people should think more about survival.
So I think, the correct attitude to <ERR type=[vp5,2-1]> chose </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> is that: everyone must <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> select </ERR> one position that he or she is interested in and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compatable </ERR> to.
Someone only <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> like </ERR> a kind of work, because they think with the time passing.
they can get more and more <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> experiments </ERR> .
Another reason is <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> maybe </ERR> they <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> like </ERR> live <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> clam </ERR> .
But someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,-s]> like </ERR> change their job very frequently, because they think the more work they even <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> had </ERR> , the more <ERR type=[np3,1-]> chance </ERR> they can catch.
But I think one should apply for a work is relation to what he <ERR type=[fm2,-]> studyed </ERR> in school, so he can do it better.
If his work has nothing with he studied in school, he has to spend much time studying new <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> knowledge </ERR> .
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> doing the same job in his life.
First, somebody's job <ERR type=[vp9,-2]> is </ERR> very fit for him.
The job can make him use his ability enough, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> feel </ERR> very happy.
They <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> fear </ERR> of facing different <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviomences </ERR> and people.
But other people often like changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
They think changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> brings them chances, they can learn many things from changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> , such as <ERR type=[fm2,-]> knowledges </ERR> , the ability of living, the attitude of living, the relationship of people.
So I like changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
They only want to do <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> same job in their lives.
They think that the time and the energy are limited, so they can't have enough time and energy to <ERR type=[vp5,6-]> changing </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
At the same time, they think it is trouble to change a job, because they must learn new knowledge and adapt new work conditions.But some like to <ERR type=[vp1,4-1]> changing </ERR> jobs.
There are some <ERR type=[np3,3-]> reason </ERR> .
Firstly, some think it can practice their capacity; secondly, it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> affort </ERR> a chance to study new knowledge and <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> broad </ERR> their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eyesight's </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> thirdly </ERR> , it is a opportunity to compete.
I think it is <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> benefit </ERR> to change jobs.
Some people like to contribute all their life <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> to </ERR> same job.
But others rather than change their <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> works </ERR> more often.
In fact, people have different attitudes towards the job because they live in different <ERR type=[np6,1-]> environment </ERR> or they have different view on life.The people that like to contribute all their life <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> to </ERR> same job may be very interested <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> in </ERR> some job, or are forced by <ERR type=[np6,1-]> parents </ERR> , friends..., even or have no confidence to join in other work.
That <ERR type=[np3,1-]> people </ERR> who more like to change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> maybe </ERR> feel the job no <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanleging </ERR> ,or they think that to do different job is enjoyment, and so on.
I think that we should do according <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> by </ERR> ourselves.
There is a debate on job-hopping, some people say it is good for one to <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> do </ERR> same job, others say it is good for one to do the various kinds of jobs.
People who say it is good to do the same job think the same job gives them steady wages, practices their basic background skills, makes them live more <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> comfortable </ERR> .People who say it is good to do the various kinds of jobs have another view.
They think various jobs give them <ERR type=[fm1,-]> intensions </ERR> , adjust them to society, give them <ERR type=[fm1,-]> changledgings </ERR> .As a undergraduate, my view on job-hopping is using what I have studied in the university for the benefits of people.
In my spare time, I do another job that is <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> relative </ERR> to my subject to make much progress of my social abilities, to do my best for the benefit of <ERR type=[np6,1-]> country </ERR> .
Some people <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> seems </ERR> more like a single job than <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> alternative job in his whole life.
They think that a single job can make them more skillful on it, while alternative <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> need </ERR> them always learn new <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> knowledge </ERR> .
But some people like alternative <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> rather than a single job, they think that alternative <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> can make their knowledge more comprehensive, while a single job restrict them on a single life.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> To </ERR> my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opion </ERR> about job-hopping, I think that if everyone can find a job which <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> fit </ERR> him and he also <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> it, he needn't always want to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> alternate </ERR> it just because other people do.
But if the job isn't <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> fit </ERR> for him, he should <ERR type=[vp9,1-][vp1,-1]> took </ERR> for another job which is <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> fit </ERR> for him .
Many people <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> likes </ERR> to engage in a kind of job all <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> along </ERR> the time.
Because they think a fixed job can bring them a stable position and a skilled work <ERR type=[cc4,2-]> procedure </ERR> .
If a job was often changed, they would try to <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> fit </ERR> in it every time, and this will <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> expend </ERR> them much time and energy.
But other people <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> likes </ERR> to change the job <ERR type=[fm2,-]> oftenly </ERR> .
Because they think different job can bring them different feeling, if they have a new job, it will make him a new position, the other <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> side </ERR> , a fixed job is no taste, it would make man a bad behavior, lose the <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> interesting </ERR> of the living.
I think, a man can't change the job time and <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> time </ERR> but also can't <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fix </ERR> on a job from time to time if <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> you </ERR> think it is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> unfit </ERR> for you.
Because you can't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> maste </ERR> the skill about your work is a short time, if you change the job <ERR type=[fm2,-]> oftenly </ERR> , you will have nothing <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> on </ERR> you living.
But, if you have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> lose </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> interested </ERR> in a job you have taken a long time, still you can't put your heart on it, if you want to make a great progress in your <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> remained </ERR> living, you'd better change a job, in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ordor </ERR> to exposed your <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> skill </ERR> enough and make a great achievement in your job, so the job can't be changed <ERR type=[fm2,-]> oftenly </ERR> , but if you find it not fit for you, you must change it as soon as possible.
<ERR type=[wd3,-5]> Their </ERR> are two kinds of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> man </ERR> .
One kind <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> tend </ERR> to do only one kind of work for long time.
Because they interested <ERR type=[aj2,1-]> on </ERR> this work very much.
Or they think they <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> had </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> do </ERR> the work very <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> skill </ERR> , and not tend to change their work.The other <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> tend </ERR> to often change their work.
Because they think the work they <ERR type=[vp4,1-]> doing </ERR> soon <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> become </ERR> <ERR type=[aj4,-1]> uninterested </ERR> , the new work can give them new <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> interesting </ERR> .
Or they love the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challendge </ERR> of new work.
I think, <ERR type=[vp4,-s]> pay </ERR> close attention to one work is a food banner, because it can make us do this work more and more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> effciencely </ERR> and improve the <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> productive </ERR> .
New work can give us new <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challendge </ERR> .
In a word, working hard, facing the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challendge </ERR> .
Because they like to meet with new challenges and opportunities.In new <ERR type=[np6,1-]> work </ERR> , they find themselves have new opportunities again.
In my opinion, we can change our work because we must do <ERR type=[np8,-1]> those </ERR> work that we can <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> interest </ERR> in .
But our life <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> are </ERR> limited, we can't always return <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> to </ERR> starting-point.
Some people like to do <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> a </ERR> job all time.
For one thing, they think that that job <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> fits </ERR> to them and they can do <ERR type=[fm2,-]> somethings </ERR> in that job.
For another, they are <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> afraid </ERR> to challenges, they <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> fear </ERR> to find a new job, like to do a job with good <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> paid </ERR> .
But some people like to do all kinds of jobs <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> usually </ERR> .
They change their jobs because they like <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> to </ERR> challenges, they want to turn out their abilities, they can keep up with the times.
In order to gain a better <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> paid </ERR> , they prefer to a new job.
I think that people should change their job when their abilities aren't <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> be </ERR> used or the boss <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> dislike </ERR> them.
But when the jobs <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> are </ERR> fit to them, they can achieve <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucess </ERR> in their jobs, they should stay and do their jobs better.
It is said that someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> hope </ERR> their jobs all along not changing.
They think that they can make <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> focus </ERR> on the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Job </ERR> and do the job better.
They can have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> expericement </ERR> on the similar <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Jobs </ERR> .
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> think </ERR> they would <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> change <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> all the way.
They say they must find a job that <ERR type=[vp9,1-2]> fit </ERR> in for them.
And they think they can have all kinds of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> expericements </ERR> through finding <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> .
My view on job-hopping is that if I find a job fitting <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> for </ERR> me, then I will not change the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Job </ERR> again.
I must make <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> focus </ERR> on the job, and do some <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> achievement </ERR> .
If the job is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> unfit </ERR> for me, I wouldn't <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> stop </ERR> find job until the job is <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> fit </ERR> for me.
Every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> people </ERR> has his or her own view on job-hopping.
Some people who intend to take <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> only </ERR> kind of job in their whole life are in the view of the stable job can offer them stable life and the chances of being promoted.
They <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> maybe </ERR> also think that just <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> engaging </ERR> in one kind of job can let them fit for the job more perfectly.
But my view on job-hoping is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffent </ERR> from the above.
If one that doesn't like his own job or the is not suitable for him, he still <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> work </ERR> in the stable position, just for the promotion by his experience.
But if one in order to find a suitable job changes his job frequently, he will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> faild </ERR> sometimes.
According to my view on job-hopping, if one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> take </ERR> no <ERR type=[fm1,-]> insteresting </ERR> in his present job or isn't suitable for his present job can change his job.
In real life, some people like to engage in <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> same job all the way.
After <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> enter </ERR> into a career which they like and have ability to do it quite well.
So they don't want to change another job, which causes they study the others from the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> begining </ERR> .
These people often like adventure and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chanllage </ERR> .
They think changing <ERR type=[np6,1-]> job </ERR> will help them to acquire much more knowledge and ability which they can cope with more practical problems in the real life.
For example, their present job is <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> lower </ERR> paid or their bosses are too hard to get along with.
As I think ,both <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thinkings </ERR> have their right <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> reasons </ERR> .
I'm a student <ERR type=[wd4,1-4]> of </ERR> department of computer science.
Also, I think I'm quite <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> suit </ERR> for doing computer work.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> then </ERR> we can be <ERR type=[wd2,-]> succeed </ERR> .
We can't change <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
For example, once there lived a farmer, he was <ERR type=[aj1,2-3]> worried </ERR> to see that the crops were very small, then he pulled the crops from the land.
The story <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> tell </ERR> us, that "One step could not go to sky".
We must try our <ERR type=[vp2,2-1]> bests </ERR> to do everything and obey the natural orders, obey the things' orders.
One day, we will be <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> succeeded </ERR> .
The reason of "haste makes <ERR type=[np1,-]> waste" </ERR> is that only hard work <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> lead </ERR> to success and to complete a hard work needs a long time.
Certainly you couldn't turn your dream into <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> practice </ERR> in one night.
You must learn <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> Arithmetic </ERR> , Chinese, physics and other basic <ERR type=[np3,2-]> course </ERR> in your primary school, and high school.
Then after years of above mentioned knowledge's study you will learn how to make a student learn <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fastly </ERR> and well in the Normal university.
Then after <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> your </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> graduated </ERR> from the Normal university, you really become a teacher.
You will see how it is to reach a goal, to catch a <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> success </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Contrastly </ERR> , if you raise a <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> purpose </ERR> today to be teacher, and you want to teach in the classroom tomorrow.
So they <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> do very fast.
When they <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> remind </ERR> , they have to do it again.
So they finish it more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> later </ERR> than normal or finish it imperfectly.
When you reach the station, you <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> find </ERR> leave off the ticket on the table.
But <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inversly </ERR> , you miss the train.
As we know,"Haste makes <ERR type=[np1,-]> waste" </ERR> refers simply to the faster one does, the fewer one gets, why ?
If we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> breach </ERR> it, the natural law will punish us.
Finally, we aren't <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> not </ERR> only advance a step, but also back a step.
For example, the wheat grows too slow, it must grow by using <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> of </ERR> necessary water, sunshine, soil.
If one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> it to grow faster and pull it higher, the wheat will dead due to loss enough water, soil.
<ERR type=[pr1,-s]> It </ERR> is also right in economic field.
In <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> 1956, </ERR> Chinese government <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to make more iron, and take all steal of whole country to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> product </ERR> the iron.
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> result </ERR> in the consequence that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> producted </ERR> iron was almost substandard product, in the meantime, the steal was also used up.
The thing wastes plenty of labor, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> finicial </ERR> and raw material, and bring about our economic ability is latter than other countries of the world for many decade years.
Only we have the necessary conditions, we <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> maybe </ERR> get a success.
Or our efforts will <ERR type=[vp7,2-]> waste </ERR> .
He <ERR type=[fm1,-]> draged </ERR> them higher than before.
Doing things too hurry will make you careless, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ever </ERR> make things be done worse.
But we shall have <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> chart </ERR> for study and go over the lesson everyday.
We can't only want to study quickly, forget <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> interview </ERR> all lesson.
Because everything has it's own <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> develop </ERR> stage.
If you only do things fast but <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> neglect </ERR> to really understand it, it is no use.
"Haste Makes <ERR type=[np1,-]> Waste" </ERR> tell us that we shall do everything carefully.
If some thing in <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> it </ERR> is failure, we would have to do it again.
So we can say <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> .
" For example, as a student <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> we </ERR> often want to read a book in a short time.
In order to read <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> it </ERR> fast, we read each passage quickly and can't understand what it means.
Second we also should persist <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> to </ERR> it, struggle for it until obtain it.
In a sense, efforts <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> the first of all factors.
For <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> a </ERR> example, a boxer before his success he must practice much and suffer from a great deal of blow that few people can endure.
The efforts that he did is <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> waste </ERR> .
Once a man <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to succeed through the way of rapid speed, he will not realize his dream.
What you can't think of is if you spend less time in working or studying, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> moreover </ERR> , you can't think over the problems relevant to the work, you will not get at your purpose.
So we can say <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> .
You can't realize your <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> idea </ERR> .
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> ", it's <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> means </ERR> if we want to reach our point we expected.
The more <ERR type=[ad3,1-]> faster </ERR> we want, the more difficult <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> that </ERR> we get it .
But at the same time we can <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> do </ERR> with the things confidently and carefully.
We can't predict the difficulties that we will face <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> to </ERR> and have not a good ready.
Then when the difficulties <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> came </ERR> to us, we usually can't <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> comfit </ERR> it well.
Someone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to be a running champion.
But he hasn't <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> analysis </ERR> his own conditions and can't have a long-time running every morning and attend the race of the running.
The result must be the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> defeating </ERR> .
So as we do <ERR type=[fm2,-]> somethings </ERR> , We must avoid "Haste Makes Waste" .
[np1,-] We should try our best for our own <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> proposal </ERR> .
For instance, the students who take part in the Band Six <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> Contest </ERR> should study English every day, learn more new words by heart, <ERR type=[vp5,-s]> doing </ERR> much reading, little by little, their listening and reading comprehension will be made great progress doing like this.
However if he often doesn't study English carefully, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> He </ERR> will fail to pass it.
Step by step, thus we can succeed, or <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> can only lead to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> makes wastes".

Most people usually <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> like </ERR> haste when they doing something.
But this will result in an opposite <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> end </ERR> .
You are necessary to remember: <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ?Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Make </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> !?
Haste reflects the strong will of our desire to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> success </ERR> .
First it often <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> us overestimate ourselves.
We will feel <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dispressed </ERR> when we don't carry out it.
Second, it also <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> make </ERR> us daydream.
Because of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> we can't concentrate on our work.
We all know that <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ?Haste </ERR> make waste".
<ERR type=[pp2,-2][wd4,1-2]> At </ERR> first week he complied with the plan.
But a week passed, he told me that he still did not pass the English <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> text </ERR> and he gave it up.
The English study <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> need </ERR> a lot of time.
This is the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> make waste".
[np1,-]
What is <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> "?
[np1,-] It implies that if one wants to do something more quickly, he may get the <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> inverse </ERR> consequence.
This will lead to your behaviour in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unconsistence </ERR> .
So it is natural that you can't obtain your <ERR type=[fm2,-]> expective </ERR> result.
In our lives, <ERR type=[pr1,-s]> it </ERR> is common.
He could get <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> to </ERR> there on foot.
But in order to save time, he <ERR type=[fm2,-]> drived </ERR> his car.
Unfortunately <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> in </ERR> the way to the supermarket, there was a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> choke </ERR> .
[np1,-] Why "haste makes waste"?
[np1,-] That usually because when we do something hurriedly, we often can't make our mind conscious completely.
There <ERR type=[vp3,-5]> are </ERR> not a very clear thought of doing something <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> former </ERR> or later, and the things get mass.
For example, as we often <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> met </ERR> in life, one day you get up too late, there <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> was </ERR> only three minutes left for you to go to school.
Sometimes, it <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> led </ERR> the thing we want to do more badly.
For example, you drive your car <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fastly </ERR> in order not to be late for work.
In the road, suddenly, a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> litter </ERR> boy <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> run </ERR> across the street, but you are late, the car struck down the boy.
You not only are late for work, but also <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> led </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> accident.So haste usually makes waste.
I <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> agree </ERR> it, every thing has its own <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> stages </ERR> and procedures, it is objective and can't be freely changed by us.
If we only <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> attend </ERR> the speed, we might <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> omit </ERR> many details or we might be careless, all these may lead to <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> failing </ERR> doing the things.
Later, my teacher told me, before you did it, you'd better go over the notes and the examples, after you had <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> understand </ERR> it.
People often <ERR type=[fm3,-]> say?Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> ?.
If we do the thing very fast, we'll fail <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> on </ERR> it.
If we firstly study speaking, writing, listening and reading, we'll <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> felt </ERR> very difficult.
Lastly, We'll <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> lose </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> intersted </ERR> in English.
A lot of <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> things </ERR> like this.
?Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> ?.
If you want to do things successfully, you must remember <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> makes <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> ".
It <ERR type=[fm1,-]> telles </ERR> us we shouldn't pay attention to the speed of a process alone.
In 1958 the authorities called on the people all over the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> town </ERR> to work hard to accelerate the speed of national economy.
So many people throughout the country began to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> meld </ERR> iron to improve the product of steel in very poor situation that the steel melt is of no use.
We usually <ERR type=[fm3,-]> say?Haste </ERR> makes waste?.
We can say many <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> examples </ERR> around us: We'll have a test, but we don't study hard <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> at </ERR> usual.
So just before the exam, we borrow a lot of books about <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> "Haste" </ERR> ,this is useless.
All the "Hastes <ERR type=[fm1,-]> " </ERR> are based on the basic learning.
Hard working can make us <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> success </ERR> , the "Hastes"is just a kind of help.
For another example, when we learn English, the new words <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> a very important part.
We should learn it everyday and <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> relate </ERR> for a long time, the"Haste" can't help us, if we believe <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> makes success", we'll be <ERR type=[wd3,-]> false </ERR> .
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> " is a proverb, which <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> express </ERR> that preparation is helpful before you do a thing, and haste perhaps doesn't do good for the thing.
Now I think everyone wants to complete a thing sooner, but if you don't investigate it ahead and make preparations for it, you will not do it <ERR type=[fm2,-]> effectly </ERR> .
On the contrary, you have to hurry <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> and </ERR> anxious, but can't do it well.
Now I will give you an example to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> express </ERR> it.
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> " is a truth.
It may include the following several <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> sides </ERR> .
First, one must grasp how to do it, <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> it's </ERR> technology and ways.
For example, if you attend a computer exam, however, you even <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unknow </ERR> the keyboard of it, you will be failed.
Second, you should have spent your time on it and could oparate it <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> skilled </ERR> .
This is like running a car, whether you only know it well but hadn't <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> cost </ERR> time to learn how to run it, you couldn't do it as usual.
So before we do <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> whatever </ERR> , we must learn it well and pay our attention <ERR type=[vp2,2-]> on </ERR> it for some time.
In <ERR type=[fm2,-]> alls </ERR> , we should be patient and <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> hard </ERR> to face everything, try our best to do everything well, haste only makes waste!
But the frequent <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> phenomena </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> that haste makes waste.
The quick <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> operate </ERR> is often careless and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> smoothlers </ERR> .
For example, when we take part in <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> examination, everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to finish the test in time or <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> on </ERR> advance, because of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> nervous </ERR> or <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> careless </ERR> , the mistakes <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unavoid </ERR> .
From above <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> station </ERR> , we conclude that <ERR type=[wd2,-s]> impatient </ERR> and carefulness are necessary when we do every things.
Only when we <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> very familiar with our duty, the high speed and good quality are attained at the same time.
"Haste makes <ERR type=[np1,-]> Waste" </ERR> means if you want to do something successfully, you shouldn't want to succeed at once.
Because you do something very <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Hasty </ERR> .
Can't offer you quality <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> wanted </ERR> .
The quality isn't good <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> meads </ERR> defeat.
That is to say can't <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> arrive </ERR> your object.
Fox example, a person <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> wanted </ERR> to study the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> knowledge </ERR> of accounting to look for a job.
Then he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> think </ERR> he has mastered accounting knowledge and get <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> be </ERR> able to be a accountant.
Then he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> attend </ERR> the examination to qualify himself to be a accountant.
He didn't study carefully while <ERR type=[vp4,-s]> read </ERR> it quickly so that he couldn't master it.
The example <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> tell </ERR> us: haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> .
My dear friends, I have something to speak with you: <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> If </ERR> want to do something and you want to succeed in it, you should do your best and have a pace after a <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> pace </ERR> .
Because <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> "
As a result, the teacher of the subject you write about will have a <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> discount </ERR> to your score.
[np1,-]
Five years ago, I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> studyed </ERR> in a small town.
So I didn't do as what she said and lifted much more.At the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> begining </ERR> , I could lift it quickly.
After a while, I was very tired, but, I tried, suddenly I fell <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> into </ERR> the road.
My mother came up to me, staring at me and saying:?Not <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> anxious </ERR> whatever you do.
Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> because </ERR> every thing has its own <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> content </ERR> .
If one of them is <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> disappeared </ERR> , the thing will be bad or useless.
But if you haven't <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> accorded </ERR> to these steps, you will never learn English very well.
Of course when you can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> many words, so that you are able to read newspaper or <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> about </ERR> English magazines, you ought to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> continue </ERR> read the words you have learned before and read the new words you haven't known.
If you do so, your English <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> level </ERR> will be better, otherwise, you only know one letter or the few words, and never learn well.
In case you want to get the purpose of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> much faster, then you will not work hard but <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> get it at once.
Firstly, I said to <ERR type=[np6,1-]> classmates </ERR> :?If we run to it, and we can get there at 10:00?.
And when we got there, it was 2:00 P.M. Another time, I determined to pass <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Maths </ERR> exam two years ago, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> especialy </ERR> I wanted to <ERR type=[vp5,2-3]> got </ERR> a high score.
Every one of us <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> expect </ERR> to do a thing both well and quickly.
If we do <ERR type=[np6,1-]> thing </ERR> too fast, mistakes will be inevitable.
For example, we all began to learn English <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> from </ERR> several years ago.
I used to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> endure </ERR> to recite all the cet 6 words in a week.
If you don't so by this sequence, it is very difficulty to <ERR type=[wd1,-2]> well </ERR> grasp English.
A man learns to walk <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> firstly </ERR> , and to run.
Just as we study in school, we almost experience the period of the primary school, the middle school, the college by <ERR type=[np2,1-]> step </ERR> .
So it is important not to do things <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hurrily </ERR> .
For example, when we studying, we must see to <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Wakes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> ".
[np1,-] Because comprehension <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> need </ERR> time.
Only with the result that I had done many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> problemes </ERR> which I do know with <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> wrong, </ERR> and I had to spend time to correct them.
That <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> was </ERR> , I failed <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> to </ERR> the Foxbase

In the developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> has </ERR> changed a lot <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> since </ERR> these 30 years.
And the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in 1960 is 200 deaths per 1,000 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> birs </ERR> , while it is 100 deaths per 1000 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> birs </ERR> in 1990.
And a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> short </ERR> number of babies <ERR type=[vp6,-1]> died </ERR> now.
From the results, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> peope </ERR> can <ERR type=[cc3,s-]> realize </ERR> the reasons that caused the changes.
For another, with the development of the science, people have more and more <ERR type=[np3,3-]> way </ERR> to treat the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diease </ERR> .
And the good conditions <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> made </ERR> people more and more <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> healthful </ERR> .
The life expectancy and the infant mortality both have <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> differently </ERR> changes in recent years.
From the above graph, we can see the changes of the life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> between 1960 to 1990.
Why <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> did </ERR> have these great changes?
The reasons are <ERR type=[cc6,-1]> very </ERR> many.
[wd4,-2] Second reason is the development of the economy, people can use much money to buy what they want, so <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> can be <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> meet </ERR> the body's needs.
Third, that is most important in my opinion, is the advanced medical technology, it is <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> because </ERR> of this reason that makes the disease become slight and make people healthy.
But I <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> can </ERR> sure that health gains will <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> still </ERR> have great changes in the future.
On the other hand, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> decreased rapidly.
With the development of developing countries the <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> healthy </ERR> condition will improve more rapidly.
One of the changes is that the life expectancy has increased and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has decreased.
A liable data shows that the life expectancy has increased by 20 years from <ERR type=[np4,3-2]> 1960's </ERR> to 1990's and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has decreased from 200 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births in the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> latest </ERR> forty years.
The reasons about the changes are that the developing country's economy has greatly increased since <ERR type=[np4,s-]> 1960's </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> morever </ERR> , the medical <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thcnology </ERR> has greatly developed.
Thus the life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> expactancy </ERR> has increased and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has increased from <ERR type=[np4,-2]> 1960's </ERR> to 1990's in the developing countries.
According to the chart, <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Health </ERR> gains in developing countries have achieved prominent progress in the past 30 years.
One can see that life expectancy has increased from 40 to 80 since 1960 to 1990, in <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> meanwhile the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has decreased from 200 %0 to 100%0.
It's an excellent <ERR type=[np1,s-]> performance </ERR> that both the life expectancy and the infant mortality have <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> changed </ERR> two times in the 30 years.
What <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> caused </ERR> this happen?
What's more, people have more money to buy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nutrious </ERR> food to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> restort </ERR> to keep their body healthy and strong.
Secondly, the government <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> cares </ERR> more for the people than before.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Mordern </ERR> hospitals have <ERR type=[vp7,3-]> founded </ERR> and good doctors and nurses are <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> afforded </ERR> .
Thirdly and the most important of all, the technology <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> are </ERR> so advanced that many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> deseases </ERR> that <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> can't </ERR> be cured are able to be cured now.
From the <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> bouyant </ERR> progress, we can expect there'll be a further progress in health gains in the future.
Namely, the life expectancy has a good <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> further </ERR> of rising while the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> will be <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> increasing </ERR> decreased.
In recent decades, life expectancy and infant mortality have <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> great </ERR> changed in developing countries.
Life expectancy has <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> great </ERR> increased, on the contrary, infant mortality has <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> great </ERR> decreased.
It has <ERR type=[cc3,-5]> increased </ERR> one-third of the primitive figure.
Infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960, <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> but, </ERR> was 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
It has decreased in <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> half </ERR> .
First, economy <ERR type=[cc2,1-]> increased </ERR> in developing countries.
It caused the improvement of the <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> level </ERR> of life and the change of the structure of food.
Second, medical <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> career </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> make </ERR> great progress and so forth.
In short, <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> mainly </ERR> , economy caused the change of the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
On the part of life expectancy, we can see, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> In </ERR> 1960, the life <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> expectancy </ERR> 40 years old.
In 1990, it reached 60 years old, with <ERR type=[np7,1-5]> the </ERR> increase of 20 years old.
On the part of infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> , the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
I think the reason is as <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> following </ERR> : First, the living standard of the people <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> increased </ERR> , people had enough food to eat and comfort places to live in.
So we can see, the health gains in developing countries <ERR type=[vp3,6-]> is </ERR> very exciting and may get better.
<ERR type=[cc4,-1]> Healthy </ERR> conditions have developed in developing countries.
Many aspects of the <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> healthy </ERR> conditions change, for example, It has stated that <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> through </ERR> the <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> statistics </ERR> : Life expectancy has changed from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
In 1960, there <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> have </ERR> 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but only <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> have </ERR> 100 deaths in 1990.
Therefore, the world <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> economic </ERR> increased very fast from 1960 to 1990, the conditions of our life are also developed.
More and more technology of medicine are applied <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> , thus <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> brought </ERR> about a good condition for people.
Another reason of health gaining is the food and the labour, many people <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> relived </ERR> from the hungry and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> burdon </ERR> of hard work.
In a word, good health and good <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heathy </ERR> conditions are gained in developing countries.
More and more people live <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> in </ERR> a good life.
Compared the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> positive </ERR> with the past, heath has gained in developing countries.
[wd4,-2] Another example, the infant mortality has decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to about 100 in 1990.
All is showing a fact that <ERR type=[fm1,s-]> heath </ERR> gains in developing countries.
We are now living in peace and most of the developing countries have ceased fire and switched to developing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> economicy </ERR> .
Secondly, the living conditions have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> impoved </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> against </ERR> the past.
became the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> topic </ERR> .
Every country is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tring </ERR> its best to develop.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Escpecially </ERR> , the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> devolping </ERR> countries have made great progresses.
Have a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> sight </ERR> on the people's health in the developing countries, we can see <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
The infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> decreased </ERR> from the 20 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persent </ERR> in 1960 to 10 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persent </ERR> in 1990.
Two <ERR type=[np3,1-][np4,s-]> group </ERR> simple numbers gave us the information of the improvement.
The cause to this <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> progress </ERR> mainly <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> because </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> devolpment </ERR> of economy.
With more money and more <ERR type=[np3,2-]> commodity </ERR> , people have better food, clothing, medical care.
Better living condition makes people more healthy, so the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> can be <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> decreased </ERR> , the life expectancy can be increased.
Another reason is more and more people are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> geting </ERR> good education, more and more medical <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> commonsense </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> were </ERR> known by people.
<ERR type=[pp2,-3]> In </ERR> according to the chart, from <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> 1960 </ERR> -- 1990, the life expectancy in developing countries has been keeping rising while the infant mortality has been keeping declining in those countries.
It is mainly because of the developing <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> in those countries.
The developing <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> provids </ERR> more financial funds, so the governments can improve the qualities <ERR type=[wd1,2-5]> both </ERR> of the people's living and medicine.
It is <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> certainly </ERR> that the health conditions in developing countries will be greatly improved if their <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> keeps developing and the governments pay more attention to the people's health condition.
<ERR type=[cc4,-1]> Healthy </ERR> condition in developing countries <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> get </ERR> dramatic improvement in recent years.
We can see the development from the above <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gramphs </ERR> .
Another example is the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> , in 1960 the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
the primary reason is the development of <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> economic </ERR> .
In recent years, most <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> of </ERR> developing countries have succeeded in developing <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> so they have much money to improve the condition of health and the standard of people's living.
At the same time, <ERR type=[np5,-]> informations </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> difuses </ERR> more and more quickly.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> people </ERR> in the developing countries can get more information about health.
And the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> also decreased.
They have paid much more attention and money <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> for </ERR> their health.
Second, the <ERR type=[np3,-3]> government </ERR> of those countries have gradually realized the importance of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> impoving </ERR> people's medical condition.
But there is still a great <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> instance </ERR> between developing and developed countries.
So we students should study hard to make more contribution <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> for </ERR> our country.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stardard </ERR> of economy isn't lower in developing countries than in developed countries.
In what situation does the populace <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> remain </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-2]> the </ERR> these countries.
Lets look <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> over </ERR> the figures of the life expectancy and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> .
The average life expectancy in 1960 was only 40 years old, but <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> till </ERR> 1990, the life expectancy <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> added </ERR> up to 60 years old.
At the same time, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> had been reducing.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> till </ERR> 1990, the infant mortality was <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> reducing </ERR> 10 percent.
The <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> increasing </ERR> of life expectancy and the reducing of infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> , there <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> was </ERR> many reasons.
Firstly, the economy in these countries had been developing and the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> living </ERR> of people had been improving.
The nations carried out many methods, for example, they strengthened the medicine equipment and <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> advanced </ERR> some good measures, we <ERR type=[vp6,-s-]> believed </ERR> there was a great development in the future.
The life expectancy <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> reaches </ERR> to 60 and the infant mortality lowers <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> to </ERR> 10%.
The reasons of these <ERR type=[np3,1-]> change </ERR> are <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> varies </ERR> from country to country.
Second, people's <ERR type=[cc2,1-2]> health </ERR> is confirmed by the advanced medical <ERR type=[np5,-]> equipments </ERR> .
With the development of the science and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technologe </ERR> , people's living condition is certain to get better and better.
In developing countries the life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spon </ERR> and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> had been greatly changed in recent thirty years.
The life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spon </ERR> had been raised; in 1960, the life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spon </ERR> was forty years, about half of the life expectancy, but <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> to </ERR> 1990, it <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> improved </ERR> to sixty years old, about one point five times <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> of </ERR> 1960.
At the same time, the infant mortality was lowered, in 1990, there were one hundred infants died in every 1000 births, but in 1960, it arrived <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> at </ERR> 200 deaths per 1000 births, in spite of this, this all lowered the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> average </ERR> .
What caused <ERR type=[pr3,-1]> this </ERR> changes ?
Further <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> more </ERR> , they do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exercies </ERR> to make themselves <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> health </ERR> .
Because of the <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd4,s-]> lelvel </ERR> their knowledge about infant increased, they looked after their baby more <ERR type=[wd2,5-]> scientific </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Although </ERR> this, the life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spon </ERR> still <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> lowers </ERR> the life expectancy, We still <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> needs </ERR> to pay attention to the problem of our health.
Do our best to low <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> down </ERR> the infant mortality.
Why has the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> condition </ERR> changed so greatly?
Firstly, with the development of social economy, people's life has improved, the structure of food has been more reasonable and the <ERR type=[np5,-]> equipments </ERR> of medicine has exchanged too.
Secondly, people pay more attention to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enegy </ERR> and their health, they do more exercises to improve it.
With the development of industry and agriculture, I believe the life <ERR type=[cc2,2-3]> expectancy </ERR> will be older, 100-year-old person will be not a story, and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> whatmore </ERR> , more and more older <ERR type=[np3,4-]> person </ERR> will <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> appears </ERR> .
From the chart, we can <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> easy </ERR> find out two trends about the <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> healthy </ERR> condition in developing countries.
One is that the life expectancy is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> geting </ERR> <ERR type=[aj3,s-][wd3,s-]> long </ERR> , the other is that the infant mortality is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> down </ERR> .
From 1960 to <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> 1990, </ERR> in 1960, life expectancy was 40 years <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> old, </ERR> infant mortality was 200 per 1,000 births, but in 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> old, </ERR> the infant mortality reduced to 100.
People can spend much money on food, living conditions, the other reason is that the governments have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> take </ERR> some measures to better the people's health, every year they'll take out much money to set up hospitals and train many medical persons.
I think, with the development of the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> word </ERR> , more and more people will live <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> long </ERR> .
From the illustration, we can see the facts: from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rised </ERR> from 40 years old to 60, and the life expectancy increased by 50%.
And the infant mortality <ERR type=[fm1,-]> decended </ERR> from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100, and the infant mortality decreased by 50%.
This is a <ERR type=[fm2,-]> dramatical </ERR> change in developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> .
Why did the change take <ERR type=[cc5,1-1]> place </ERR> dramatically?
In the developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> , with the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> increasing </ERR> of the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> level-life </ERR> , the individual medical <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> measures </ERR> improved.
The number of hospitals and doctors kept rising, the medical measures <ERR type=[cc5,-2]> improved </ERR> very much.
So the life expectancy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rised </ERR> and the infant expectancy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> decended </ERR> .
With the development of society, the life expectancy has increased in developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> .
In <ERR type=[np4,s-]> 1960s' </ERR> , the life expectancy is about 40 years old, and in <ERR type=[np4,s-]> 1990s' </ERR> , it is about 60 years old.
In <ERR type=[np4,s-]> 1960s' </ERR> , the infant mortality is 200 deaths per 1000 births, and it decreased to about 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990s'.
The reason of the change is that the standard of <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> life </ERR> and the medicine condition <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> has </ERR> been improved.
The <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> technology </ERR> of science has been developed quickly, which <ERR type=[vp3,5-][vp1,-4]> contribute </ERR> the development of economy.
With the improvement of the medicine condition, the life expectancy has been increased and the infant mortality has <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> declined </ERR> .
This can be seen from the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> instructions </ERR> given in <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> Chinese </ERR> .
In 1960, the life expectancy was only 40 years old and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was as high as 200 per 1,000.
In 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years old and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was only 100 per 1,000.
<ERR type=[wd3,-3]> It </ERR> is to say, people's life expectancy became <ERR type=[aj3,s-][wd3,s-]> long </ERR> and the infant mortality reduced.
A study <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> show </ERR> that the life expectancy of developing <ERR type=[np6,2-]> country </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> more than 60 years old <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> until </ERR> 1990.
That is to say, it <ERR type=[vp6,-s-]> will </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-6]> increase </ERR> 20 years <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> than </ERR> that of 1960, when life expectancy <ERR type=[vp6,6-]> is </ERR> 40 years old.
While the infant mortality in the developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> in 1996 is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Until </ERR> 1990, it <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> will </ERR> decrease <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> half </ERR> 1960.
First in the past decade <ERR type=[wd5,2-]> years </ERR> , the level of economic growth <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rised </ERR> rapidly.
People can eat well and can care for their health <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> from </ERR> adding the food <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[np5,-]> nutritions </ERR> .
Second, with the development of the technology, the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> chemically </ERR> facilities have increased and new medicines have been invented.
In conclusion, the rapid development of economy and technology <ERR type=[vp3,7-][vp1,s-]> lead </ERR> to the life expectancy and infant mortality changed greatly.
In 1960 life expectancy was 40 years old and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But in 1990, life expectancy was 60 years old, and infant mortality was 100 deaths per 1000 births in developing countries <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> of </ERR> the world.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> In </ERR> 1960, because many developing countries gained independence not long ago, they couldn't have money to develop their economy, but after 30 years, with the help of the world the people in these countries make rapid progress.
In 1960 some developing countries <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> had </ERR> wars with each other.
I think with the help of the <ERR type=[np3,s-]> government </ERR> , <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> hard </ERR> people in developing countries will also have a good life.
The illustration showed us that life expectancy in 1960 was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fourty </ERR> and it became sixty in 1990.
We also knew from the illustration that infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and it became 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
From these changes we realized that life expectancy was <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> raising </ERR> and infant mortality was becoming <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> low </ERR> .
The reason for these changes <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> existed </ERR> in two points.
First, material <ERR type=[cc2,1-2]> life </ERR> was increased in developing countries.
Second, mental <ERR type=[cc2,1-2]> life </ERR> was increased too.
For instance, in many developing countries, people couldn't <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> feed </ERR> for <ERR type=[fm2,-]> themself </ERR> in 1960.
According to the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> table </ERR> , the expectancy has increased from 40 years old to 60 years old, on the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> countrary </ERR> the infant mortality is decreased from 20% to 10% in developing countries in the past 30 years.
Firstly, with the development of society, people can get more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nutrious </ERR> food such as meat, egg and so on to eat.
This helps old people live longer and infants <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> became </ERR> healthier.
Secondly, medical <ERR type=[np5,-]> equipments </ERR> develop quickly in these countries.
By this <ERR type=[vp1,2-s-]> means </ERR> he can know what illness he gets and <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> be </ERR> cured more quickly than in the past.
In their free time they can do more exercise to keep themselves <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heathy </ERR> .
In different countries, people go to work, and realize their <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> human </ERR> value.
They write their different life <ERR type=[cc2,2-]> travelling </ERR> .
In developing countries, people work hard to make <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> life </ERR> .
Their health is worth <ERR type=[fm1,-]> worring </ERR> .
The life expectancy of developing countries in <ERR type=[np4,s-]> 1960's </ERR> was 40 years old.
The infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> that <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> time </ERR> of developing countries was two hundred deaths per one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thouthend </ERR> births.
The important reason was that the food was not enough <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> to </ERR> so many people in 1960.
And the developed <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contries </ERR> took hold <ERR type=[cc3,2-3]> of </ERR> the world <ERR type=[fm1,-]> econimic </ERR> , that made <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> the </ERR> most developing <ERR type=[np4,-]> countries's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> people </ERR> in deep trouble.
Now, the developing <ERR type=[np4,-]> countries's </ERR> people stand up.
They by their <ERR type=[np3,1-]> hand </ERR> , by their pains, <ERR type=[cc3,-4]> gain </ERR> their own countries.
They are never to worry about <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> no </ERR> eating!
They also build <ERR type=[wd2,3-1]> they </ERR> industries, <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> developing </ERR> technology.
In the developing countries, the life expectancy is 60 years old, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is one hundred death per one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thouthend </ERR> births in 1990.
In one word, the people's health is getting good and <ERR type=[aj3,4-]> good </ERR> in developing countries.
As is <ERR type=[vp9,1-][wd4,s-]> know </ERR> <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> above </ERR> the chart given in Chinese , the life expectancy was 40 years old in 1960.
On the other hand, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in the developing countries had decreased very much.
But in 1990 the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was only <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> half </ERR> of 1960's, 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
It is important that the agriculture in the developing countries has developed, for it made it possible that more and more <ERR type=[np5,-]> wheats </ERR> and corns <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> produced </ERR> to feed <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> on </ERR> more people.
Besides, the industrialization in the developing countries could contribute to <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> them </ERR> .
From this chart we can see the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> variety </ERR> of the life expectancy and of the infant mortality.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy is expected <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> 40 years old while it is sixty years old in 1990.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Similarily </ERR> , the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whears </ERR> it is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> decrease </ERR> by 100 in 1990.
In 1990, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
<ERR type=[wd4,-2]> In </ERR> old days, people didn't know how to use some useful things such as man-made product.
Nowadays, people not only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> manufact </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> synthesis </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> febel </ERR> but also <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> refine </ERR> some useful things from wild plants and animals.
Second, this is the result of the <ERR type=[cc1,-1]> body </ERR> quality of the people.
Man is eating <ERR type=[np4,-]> animals's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> food </ERR> such as fish and hens.
They are <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> tend </ERR> to eat the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> ingredient </ERR> food.
The last thing, <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> with </ERR> the result of man's curing some fatal diseases, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> this </ERR> mainly caused the decrease of the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> .
The life expectancy of people and the infant mortality <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> the developing countries have a <ERR type=[ad2,-1]> very </ERR> changes from 1960 to 1990.
<ERR type=[pr1,s-]> These </ERR> can be known from above <ERR type=[np6,3-]> table </ERR> .
We can <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> study </ERR> that during 1960, the people's life is very short.
And the infant mortality is also <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> higher </ERR> , which comes to the <ERR type=[np3,-3]> numbers </ERR> of 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
But, in 1990, these situations <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> change </ERR> largely.
The life expectancy of the developing countries <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> become </ERR> longer, 60 years old.
As far as the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is concerned, which <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> breaks </ERR> down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why do the situations <ERR type=[vp9,3-]> happening </ERR> ?
With the <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> level </ERR> standards advancing, people can get the necessary things for their living.
Second, the medical conditions <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> is </ERR> better than <ERR type=[fm1,-]> befo </ERR> r. So people can prevent themselves from the illness, and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> staintain </ERR> their health.
In short, the advancing environment, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> as </ERR> the economy, the medicine and other conditions result in the large changes of the life expectancy and the infant mortality <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> developping </ERR> countries from 1960 to 1990.
According to the information from the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> draft </ERR> , we can easily find that health gains in developing countries.
Secondly, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is decreasing apparently.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Thus </ERR> in 1990 the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> reduced <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> down </ERR> to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
I think the reasons that cause the great <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd4,s-]> changments </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> as </ERR> following.
First, medical <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technicals </ERR> have developed greatly.
Some illness that couldn't be <ERR type=[cc3,5-]> solved </ERR> in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pass </ERR> can be cured easily now.
All these makes the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> changements </ERR> .
If people in developing countries work more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> hard </ERR> than <ERR type=[fm1,-]> befor </ERR> our life will be better than now.
In the past years, the life <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> expectancy </ERR> in developing country is very small, and the infant mortality of these country is very high.
However, in the year of 1990, the situation <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> had a very large change.
The life expectancy in developing country is 60 years old, which is <ERR type=[wd1,-3]> more </ERR> 20 years than that of 1960.
And the infant mortality <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> have </ERR> decreased to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
All <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> this <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> show </ERR> a profound change in the life of developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> .
The reason of the change <ERR type=[vp3,5-][cc2,5-1]> have </ERR> many.
First, the <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> life </ERR> standard in these countries has obviously improved.
So their <ERR type=[np5,-]> healthes </ERR> are very <ERR type=[wd1,2-2]> good </ERR> in condition.
Second, the development of the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> medicine </ERR> service <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> results </ERR> the increase of life expectancy.
As <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> last </ERR> , the world is relatively peaceful, which also is <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> important reason of the change.
According to the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> datas </ERR> about the life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries, we can see that it has changed much since 1960.
The life expectancy's range in 1960 was <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> 0 </ERR> ~ 20, while in 1990 it was <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> 0 </ERR> ~ 60.
And the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> just </ERR> opposite.
In 1960, its range was <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> 0 </ERR> ~ 200, and in 1990 it was <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> 0 </ERR> ~ 100.
So we can see that the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was <ERR type=[vp1,4-2]> declined </ERR> very much.
Why was the <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> things </ERR> like that?
We can understand it from these <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> ways </ERR> .
First, in the past, developing countries hadn't strong <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> .
People in those countries were <ERR type=[vp7,5-2]> suffered </ERR> from serious <ERR type=[np6,s-]> disease </ERR> .
And in <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> these days, the developing countries developed fast, so their people have had good life, especially in <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> medicine </ERR> condition.
Secondly, <ERR type=[pp1,-4]> with </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> economic </ERR> goes better, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> politicy </ERR> gets satisfactory.
Thus, people are living happily not only in material life but also in <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> spirit </ERR> life.
Thirdly, people have more spare time to live with their children than before.... <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> With </ERR> a word, the health has been <ERR type=[fm2,-]> payed </ERR> more <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> attentions </ERR> than ever.
In developing countries life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> taken </ERR> place <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> at </ERR> past thirty years.
Life expectancy, in 1960, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> it </ERR> was 40 years old <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> about </ERR> , however in 1990, it's 60 years old.
Infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> varied from 2 percent(1960) to 10 percent (1990).
<ERR type=[wd4,-2]> From </ERR> above we can see those two aspects <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> varied </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> obovisouly </ERR> .
Why this variation <ERR type=[vp9,3-1]> taken </ERR> place?
<ERR type=[pp2,-4]> By </ERR> my view of point, first is the development of economy.
The developing countries are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> independed </ERR> which makes them develop their national economy.
Economy is the base of <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> .
Second the government <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> take </ERR> care of people, they take measures to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> prompt </ERR> people's <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> healthy </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> for </ERR> example, the state <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> set </ERR> up all kinds of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> hospital </ERR> , this is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benifit </ERR> to people's remedy.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> today </ERR> more and more people <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> believe </ERR> science, this will be good for their health.
In short, the variation of life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in developing countries showed the progress of the society.
With the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of the world, the life expectancy will be more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> higher </ERR> and infant mortality more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> lower </ERR> .
From this chart, we can see that in the developing countries, in 1960, the life expectancy was about forties but the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> deaths </ERR> reached more than 200 per 1,000 births.
And in 1990, the life expectancy increased to sixties, on the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contray </ERR> , the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> deaths </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> decreased </ERR> about 100 per 1,000 births.
Why the life expectancy gets higher, but the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> deaths </ERR> per 1,000 births get lower?
There are three reasons: The first one is that the medical <ERR type=[fm1,-]> instrurements </ERR> is advanced, which can save more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> babbies </ERR> from the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> deasis </ERR> than before.
The second is the society <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> call </ERR> on people to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> preserve </ERR> infants, and provides some measures.
The third is the human <ERR type=[np3,s-]> being </ERR> give more cautiousness to this <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> question </ERR> .
In <ERR type=[pp2,1-1]> one </ERR> word, the more quickly the country developed the higher the life expectancy and the lower the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> death per 1,000 births.
In 1960, people's life expectancy <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> developing countries was forty years old, while in 1990 it was sixty years old.
Through this we can see that the developing countries' <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> people </ERR> life had become longer.
The baby's infant mortality, however, had decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> during </ERR> the same time.
The foods became enough, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> medician </ERR> conditions were greatly developed and people's living conditions were developed <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> also </ERR> with the development of economy.
All these made people's life <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> of </ERR> developing countries better.
Now with these country <ERR type=[np3,1-]> 's </ERR> development, people's life is becoming longer and the <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> baby's </ERR> infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is becoming lower.
It's certain that developing countries' <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> people </ERR> life will be more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> happier </ERR> in the future.
As can be seen from the table, during the periods from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> increasing from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
However, infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> decreasing from 200 in 1960 to 100 in 1990, per 1,000 births.
Why did this <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> case </ERR> take place?
Some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> medines </ERR> could not be got.
With the development of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> civillization </ERR> , the medical standard is developing.
<ERR type=[wd5,-1]> The </ERR> both can be seen from the development of China.
When I was young, my family was poor, but now <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> days </ERR> , my family is changing much.
According to the chart given by the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compersition </ERR> it is <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> obviously </ERR> that from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy is rising rapidly and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> reliving </ERR> quickly in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> developping </ERR> countries.
Why does this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tread </ERR> come out then?
We say that it is because of the development of science in developing countries, people <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> do </ERR> any ways to increase their living level, for example, in our country, people do their best to develop agriculture, and do some experiments to increase the level of technology.
So people don't have to worry <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> about </ERR> nothing to eat.
Many people <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> in </ERR> our ages know that we should eat clean food, not <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> to </ERR> eat food we <ERR type=[vp6,-2]> don't </ERR> eat before.
People also <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> know </ERR> some knowledge of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> medical </ERR> , so they can apply <ERR type=[pr3,7-]> them </ERR> in their everyday <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lifes </ERR> .
In a word, it is the development of science that <ERR type=[vp3,7-][vp1,-7]> make </ERR> the trend in the chart <ERR type=[vp4,-]> appeared </ERR> -- the life expectancy rising and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> going down.
There is a great change in developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> about life expectancy.
<ERR type=[pp2,-3]> In </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> same </ERR> the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is changed.
There <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> was </ERR> 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
From 1960 to 1990 the developing <ERR type=[np3,s-]> country </ERR> have a <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> rapidly </ERR> development in their <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> .
Secondly, the developing <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> impacts the development of the science.
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> particully </ERR> in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> medicial </ERR> .
The modern <ERR type=[fm1,-]> medicial </ERR> technology <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> deduces </ERR> the infant mortality.
The old people gained a good care <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> of </ERR> .
The reasons are not only what I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> refered </ERR> to above.
But I <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> think </ERR> them as the important reasons for the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> changs </ERR> of the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
In developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> , people commonly have a longer life than ever.
In 1960, the life expectancy of the developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> is 40 years old.
But <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> contrary </ERR> to that, the infant mortality decreases when it compares with 1960's.
In my opinion, it is largely due to the development of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> in developing <ERR type=[np6,2-]> country </ERR> .
In addition, with the development of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> , the medical conditions are improving accordingly.
In developing countries, the life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> had changed a lot during the past thirty years from 1960 to 1990.
It increased sixty years old <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> till </ERR> 1990.
On the contrary, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 and decreased 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why did it <ERR type=[vp1,3-2]> occur </ERR> this situation?
First, I thought that the standard of living had <ERR type=[cc5,-2]> improved </ERR> very much.
In 1960, human <ERR type=[np3,s-]> being </ERR> depended on the corn, less vegetable and eggs.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Till </ERR> 1990, they would go to hospital before they had <ERR type=[np6,1-]> baby </ERR> .
The woman would be treated by doctors and nurses, so the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was only half that in 1960.
Besides these two reasons above, there <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> was </ERR> other reasons.
From the graph it can be seen that life expectancy has <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> upward trend from 1960 to 1990.
<ERR type=[vp5,-6]> Comparing </ERR> with life expectance, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Infant </ERR> mortality is just <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> the </ERR> way round, it has a downward trend between 1960 and 1990.
In 1960, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Infant </ERR> mortality was 200 deaths per 100 births, while in 1990, it <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> decreased </ERR> a half.
Such <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> eminent </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> changes </ERR> mainly because of two <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> aspects </ERR> .
One is the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> increasing </ERR> of living condition, it makes people healthy.
The other is the <ERR type=[wd2,-3]> progressing </ERR> of medical service.
Of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couse </ERR> , there are still other causes <ERR type=[vp5,5-2]> effected </ERR> such changes.
Life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> can indicate the development of a country.
<ERR type=[wd4,-1]> In </ERR> <ERR type=[np4,2-]> 1960's </ERR> , it's <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> soon </ERR> after liberation <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> from </ERR> domination of imperialist countries, many developed countries <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> starting to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> develope </ERR> their industry and <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> economic </ERR> .
At that time, people lived in poor condition and hadn't enough facilities to improve <ERR type=[np4,-1]> people </ERR> life.
Many people died of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> desease </ERR> .
Through thirty years' development, many countries have changed <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
Their <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> develops fast, their people's life has improved <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> high </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> 1990, the expectancy <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> raised </ERR> to sixty and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> declined </ERR> to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
<ERR type=[pr1,s-]> This </ERR> is what we expect most.
The life expectancy in 1960 <ERR type=[vp6,5-2]> is </ERR> 40 years and in 1990 increased to 60 years old.
The infant mortality in 1960 is 250%00 and decreased to 100 %00 <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> 1990.
Secondly, the countries <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> economic </ERR> developed in the 30 years.
<ERR type=[np5,-]> Nutritions </ERR> can be got.
Thirdly, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> medical level developed, people have enough money to build their hospitals and other constructions .Many kinds of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> deseases </ERR> can be cured.
Because of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mationed </ERR> reasons, health gains in developing countries.
Many changes have taken place in the world including the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> human's </ERR> span.
According to the investigation, the life expectancy in developing countries is 60 in 1990 <ERR type=[fm2,-]> insteading </ERR> of 40 in 1960.
Meanwhile, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> of per 1,000 births is 100 in 1990 <ERR type=[fm2,-]> insteading </ERR> of 200 in 1960.
The reason that causes the huge <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> exchanges </ERR> lies in three points.
First, there is a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fatastic </ERR> spurt of the productivity in many developing countries during these 30 years.
Secondly, the governments have paid more attention to the people's security, working conditions and <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> nutritious </ERR> protection, etc.
Thirdly, the developed countries are now <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> declining </ERR> the gains from the developing ones in trades.
This <ERR type=[vp1,-8]> makes </ERR> the latter can develop more freely than before.
The life expectancy has <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> increase </ERR> from 40 years old to 60 years old while the infant mortality declined from 200 to 100 in 1000 births.
From this change, we can draw a <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> conclude </ERR> that health gains in developing countries.
The changes in life expectancy and infant mortality <ERR type=[vp3,8-]> lies </ERR> in some reasons.
First, in the 1960's, most developing countries had gained the victory of revolution, with the victory, they developed their technology, which effected the medicine, so the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> declined and the people's life expectancy increased .
Secondly, people have more money to <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> develop </ERR> their diet.
which strengthened their bodies and made them with <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> hold </ERR> the diseases.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> For </ERR> the third people take more care of their bodies.
They <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> take </ERR> more exercises than ever.
For these reasons, people in developing countries have gained health in the past thirty <ERR type=[np3,1-]> year </ERR> .
With the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of technology, people's life will be much longer in the future.
It's well-known that, today the developing countries develop rapidly, not only the development of industry, agriculture but also medical <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> cases </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> trace </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> cases </ERR> , etc.
The society is becoming rich, and <ERR type=[np8,-4]> many </ERR> advanced <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> healthy </ERR> equipment <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> are </ERR> set up.
People also have more money to improve their <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> live </ERR> standard.
They pay more attention to <ERR type=[vp5,4-]> live </ERR> better and better.
With the improvement of <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> live </ERR> standard and <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> medical </ERR> , healthy <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> cases </ERR> , the life expectancy rises.
Meanwhile, people think babies are <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> more </ERR> important.
They do their best to feed their babies well, to bring up <ERR type=[wd1,3-]> them </ERR> well.
With the development of the developing countries, we are sure that the health can <ERR type=[cc5,-3]> gain </ERR> more and more.
From the information that has been <ERR type=[fm1,-]> affored </ERR> .
We can see that the life expectancy has increased from forty years old in 1960 to sixty years old in 1990, and the infant mortality has reduced from twenty <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persent </ERR> in 1960 to ten <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persent </ERR> in 1990.
This <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> dedicates </ERR> the health gains in developing countries.
There is <ERR type=[np8,-s]> much </ERR> reason, about these changes.
First, from 1960, there was few world <ERR type=[np3,2-]> war </ERR> breaking out.
People lived a more peaceful life than <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> at </ERR> the past.
The number of the <ERR type=[np3,4-]> victim </ERR> in the war had reduced greatly.
Second, the developing countries had paid more attention to the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> people's living <ERR type=[cc2,1-1]> condition </ERR> increased year by year.
The health <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> are </ERR> getting better too.
The number of <ERR type=[wd4,1-1][pr5,1-1]> which </ERR> died of disease got smaller and smaller.
<ERR type=[wd4,s-]> Most </ERR> of all is the states paying more attention to the health of the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> persons </ERR> in their countries.
From the chart, we drew a conclusion that the life expectancy increased rapidly and the infant mortality <ERR type=[fm1,-]> discreased </ERR> sharply from 1960 to 1990, in the developing countries.
This <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> thing </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> consisted </ERR> in various <ERR type=[np3,1-]> aspect </ERR> of the society.
In this atmosphere, old people can take care of <ERR type=[pr3,6-]> himself </ERR> and adult people have enough time to look after their infants.
Second, with the medical development, the illness of old people can be controlled and the infant can be taken care of, many other <ERR type=[np3,2-1]> aspect </ERR> all can result in <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
In 1990, the living standard of people, <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> raise </ERR> all over the developing countries, the life expectancy of <ERR type=[wd4,4-]> old </ERR> rise and infant <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> mortality </ERR> down.
In the <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> latter </ERR> of this century, great changes have taken place in life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
A case in point is <ERR type=[fm3,-]> china </ERR> .
In terms <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> of </ERR> the chart, <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> on </ERR> one hand, life expectancy in 1960 was 40 years old, and it had increased to 60 years old in 1990, on the other hand, infant mortality in 1960 was 200 deaths per 1,000 births, and it had decreased to 100 in 1990.
I think there are two <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> cardinal </ERR> reasons about it.
First, medical technology improved, thus more <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> wholesome </ERR> babies are brought to the world .
Second, life conditions are better and better, people could pay more attention to the nutrition <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> to </ERR> their diet.
According to the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> instructions </ERR> , we can see that the life expectancy in developing countries increased markedly.
In China, the life expectancy was <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> roared </ERR> from 40 years old in 1960 to 80 years old in 1990.
At the same time the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> decreased from 200 to 100(deaths per 1000 births).
Why the changes <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> were </ERR> so <ERR type=[cc4,4-]> large </ERR> in 30 years and what <ERR type=[vp3,1-3]> lead </ERR> to these changes?
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> At </ERR> first, in that 30 years, most developing countries focus their attentions on the economic construction and they have gained great success.
That also <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp1,s-]> make </ERR> the life <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> expected </ERR> increased and the infant mortality decreased.
The developing countries' life expectancy and infant mortality have appeared a great <ERR type=[fm2,-]> changment </ERR> from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old while in 1990 it adds to 60 years old, the reason for this <ERR type=[fm2,-]> changment </ERR> is mainly <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> about </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> increasing </ERR> of life level, people are no longer <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hungery </ERR> .
They <ERR type=[fm1,-]> primally </ERR> live a happy and healthy life, so these cause the rise of life expectancy.
Besides the increasing <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> rat </ERR> of life expectancy, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has decreased from 1960 to 1990.
About 250 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960. <ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> a very high number.
But in 1990, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It's </ERR> down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births, the <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> mainly </ERR> reason of this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rangs </ERR> is that the people's <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> healthy </ERR> condition has improved with the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> medical </ERR> .
People have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> controled </ERR> many <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> influencing </ERR> diseases and the quality of food and drink has been increased.
People's <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> healthy </ERR> condition is better than before.
With the developing <ERR type=[np4,-1]> countries </ERR> independence and development.
We believe that the life expectancy <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> will </ERR> more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> high </ERR> , on the other hand, infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> will </ERR> more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> low </ERR> .
The above table indicated that life expectancy increased and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> reduced in developing countries.
The infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in developing countries was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
The reason that resulted in the changes <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> were </ERR> chiefly the development of the science.
First, the development of the science resulted in improving the standard of life, which <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> make </ERR> people have enough food to eat, not worry about living, and lead a happy life.
Second, the development of science <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> lead </ERR> to the applications of technology in all kinds of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> field </ERR> .
People can get insurance of life, what's more the development of medicine made the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> lower than before.
According to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> invastigation </ERR> , the life expectancy in <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> advancing </ERR> countries is 40 years old in 1960; But it is 60 years old in 1990.
Infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960, but it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
First, the life condition is much better than before, the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> mortality </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> hungry </ERR> is very small.
When a man or infant is ill, he or she can get good <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> treaty </ERR> .
Third, now more and more people are <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> making </ERR> exercise.
This <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> strengthen </ERR> their bodies and avoid many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diseas </ERR> .
I believe there will be greater change <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> in </ERR> future.
From the graph we can <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> know </ERR> about the life expectancy and infant mortality have a great change from 1960 to 1990 in the developing countries.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Otherwise </ERR> in 1990, people could <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> live </ERR> <ERR type=[np1,-3]> average </ERR> 60 years old.
At the same time, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Infant </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has declined.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but it was only the half <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> rate </ERR> of 1960's when it came to 1990.
From that <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> all </ERR> , it <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,-4]> show </ERR> us a <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> pleasure </ERR> progress on health in developing countries.
What <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> cause </ERR> those great <ERR type=[np3,2-]> change </ERR> on earth?
The main reason is the development of their economy, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thuse </ERR> lead to the development of the medicine.
A great change <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> on </ERR> health has happened in these years in developing countries.
There are some <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fingers </ERR> about the life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
In 1960, the life expectancy was 40 years old, and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was two hundreds deaths per 1,000 births.
While in 1990, it is reported that the life expectancy was sixty years old and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> under </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> maybe </ERR> the answer.
First, with the living condition <ERR type=[vp4,4-1]> get </ERR> better, people are fond of their <ERR type=[np3,s-]> life </ERR> .
Second, the level of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> medical </ERR> was <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> rose </ERR> .
People needn't worry about the small disease <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> no </ERR> longer.
All of those <ERR type=[np3,1-]> reason </ERR> made the health gains in developing countries possible.
The health gains in developing countries <ERR type=[vp3,6-]> is </ERR> gradually changed.
According to the instruction given in <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> Chinese </ERR> .
We can learn about <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sth </ERR> .
In 1960, the life expectancy in <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> Chinese </ERR> was 40 years old.
But in <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> 1990, </ERR> increased to 60 years old.
But when it was in 1990, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> declined to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
More and more people realize that <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> healthy </ERR> is important to a person, they did a lot to improve their <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> constitution </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> , </ERR> build up their <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> healthy </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> This </ERR> is a great accomplishment for human beings to make such a great progress in no less than half <ERR type=[np7,-1]> an </ERR> century.
With the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of the world <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> , science and technology, people become rich and care more about <ERR type=[pr3,6-]> his </ERR> life and the future of <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> descendants.
Of course, there was no war like World War I and II, the peaceful environment <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> give </ERR> more vigor to the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of human <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> beings </ERR> in developing countries .Thus, the life expectancy rise to a high level and the infant mortality fall to a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> new </ERR> level.
From the above graph we can see that the life expectancy of developing countries has risen from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has reduced from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The reason that there are such changes is that in the old days developing countries had brutal wars and was <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> poverty </ERR> , the people had not enough food and clothes .
Further <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> more </ERR> , the countries take on a peaceful look.
From the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> gram </ERR> , we can draw a conclusion that the life expectancy is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cresing </ERR> and infant mortality is decreasing in developing countries in the world.
During the thirty years from 1960 <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> till </ERR> 1990, the life expectancy <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rised </ERR> from 40 to 60 years old.
Why did these changes <ERR type=[vp9,3-]> took </ERR> place?
First, the developing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contries' </ERR> economy made a rapid progress.
This <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> provided </ERR> the enough <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> production </ERR> to the people to meet their needs.
Second, the qualities of the developing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contries' </ERR> people also <ERR type=[vp4,1-1]> be </ERR> raised.
Many fatal <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dieases </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> transferted </ERR> among people was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> elimated </ERR> .
Third, the development of medicine can cure many incurable diseases <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> in </ERR> old days.
The health gains in developing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contries </ERR> show the level of life <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rised </ERR> much.
First, the life expectancy of <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> developing </ERR> is 40 years old in 1960.
You see, the <ERR type=[cc2,-3]> changes </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> so much.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> At </ERR> first, the economy of the developing country is the main reason.
With the <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> improving </ERR> of the developing countries people's living standard, the changes <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> expected.
Then, the peace of the world is also an important <ERR type=[np3,2-]> reasons </ERR> .
In a word, health gains in developing countries <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> has </ERR> made a great progress.
In 1960, the <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> longest </ERR> life expectancy of developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> is no more than 40 years old and at that <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> moment </ERR> infant mortality is high.
It is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> estimited </ERR> that the total death rate of infant is 25%.
Life <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> time </ERR> is short and the death rate is <ERR type=[fm2,-]> comparely </ERR> high.
So many methods are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> adoped </ERR> to solve the problem.
They set up many public medical <ERR type=[fm1,-]> utilies </ERR> and called on people to pay attention to their physical exercise and keep bodies healthy by medium.
In 1990 the longest <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> lifetime </ERR> reached 80 years old and the infant mortality dropped by 15%.
Mankind's life in developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> has been <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> expanded </ERR> with their own <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> attempts </ERR> .
With the development of their society people <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> realized </ERR> how important to keep their own body healthy and the whole country's health gains equally.
From the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> draft </ERR> we can see, in developing countries, life expectancy and infant mortality in 1990 are very different from those in 1960.
The reasons for the result are various, for example, the medical level's <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> increasing </ERR> and the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> economics' </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> developing </ERR> are all <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> essential </ERR> .
Of all reasons, I think the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> economics' </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> developing </ERR> is important, with the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> economics </ERR> , people's expenditure level is higher .
In conclusion, with the <ERR type=[wd2,-3]> developing </ERR> of the society people's life expectancy will be higher and infant mortality will be much lower.
The other issue that attracts our attention <ERR type=[wd5,7-]> to </ERR> is that infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is on the decline to ten percent in 1990. against twenty-five percent in 1960.
With time passing, people's life expectancy <ERR type=[ad1,-1]> still </ERR> will <ERR type=[vp1,1-1]> prolong </ERR> and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[ad1,-1]> still </ERR> will be on the decline.
<ERR type=[fm3,-][pp2,-3]> in </ERR> the one hand, people's physical <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> life </ERR> standard is gradually being <ERR type=[fm2,-]> raisen </ERR> .
With <ERR type=[fm1,-]> socialty </ERR> developing rapidly, <ERR type=[pp2,-3]> in </ERR> the other hand, people change their <ERR type=[np6,1-]> mind </ERR> step by step, <ERR type=[fm3,s-s-]> because </ERR> of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> people know how to prefect their bodies, and they know how to take care of their infants, and so on .
So we need greatly change people's idea in developing countries, in order to make the people realize <ERR type=[wd5,1-s-]> that </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> How </ERR> important it is to stay <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> health </ERR> .
In the developing countries, the life expectancy is <ERR type=[cc6,-1]> sharply </ERR> long, and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> decrease </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd4,s-]> This </ERR> due to the health state is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> increase </ERR> .
From 1960 to 1990, Chinese life expectancy <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp6,s-]> increase </ERR> from 40 to more than 60, but infant mortality <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> decrease </ERR> from 200 to 100 from 1960 to 1990.
What <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,-4]> cause </ERR> this health state increase?
First of all, living <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> standers </ERR> is improved in developing countries.
Not only did we solve our food <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> question </ERR> , but we attach importance to <ERR type=[np5,-]> nutritions </ERR> : Second, with the living standard improved, our medical <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> stander </ERR> is also improved.
We can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> cured </ERR> many <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> of </ERR> deadly diseases, not to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> saying </ERR> of light illness, another, our spirits <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> higher than before, and this also <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> lead </ERR> to health gains .
By and large, developing countries are <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> developing </ERR> to flourish and strength.
With the development of the science and technology, the life expectancy and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in developing countries have a great change.
The reasons <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> in </ERR> which caused the change are various.
And, with the development of the living conditions in the developing countries, they have <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> contained </ERR> more and more chances to <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> overcome </ERR> the infant mortality and to increase the life expectancy.
Today, in the developing countries, the life expectancy is increasing while the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is declining.
From the graphs, we can find that, from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy has increased from forty to sixty, and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has declined from two hundred and fifty deaths per 1,000 births to only 100.
This makes it possible that people can live well and their heath could be <ERR type=[ad2,s-]> well </ERR> .
Second, people's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technologe </ERR> of medicine has <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> increase </ERR> .
This makes infant mortality <ERR type=[fm2,-]> declinedly </ERR> .
These changes <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd2,4-4]> reflect </ERR> of development of our society.
Recently, there are great changes in developing countries, the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> most </ERR> of those is the change of health, including the life expectancy and infant mortality.
In developing countries, the people live more and more <ERR type=[ad3,3-]> longer </ERR> , but the infant mortality <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> become </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> large </ERR> , why does it happen like this ?
The most <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> important </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,1-]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> which </ERR> is the <ERR type=[wd7,-]> notice </ERR> of health.
With the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> medicine </ERR> cause more and more people can live better than before, In 1960 the life expectancy is 40 <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> at </ERR> the average but in 1990, it becomes 60 years old and some can live much older.
However, infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is different in 1960, the rate of death was 200 deaths per 1000 births, but in 1990 it was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
With the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of science and technology, more and more people can live longer, developing countries gain the health of people .
As a developing country, China, its health gains is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> instructed </ERR> by two pictures -- life expectancy and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Infant </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> .
The second, with the level raising of the people's life <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condation </ERR> , people grow stronger and stronger, so they can <ERR type=[cc3,-5]> reject </ERR> some of the bad <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condations </ERR> .
And the third reason, many developing countries(China included), have carried <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> out </ERR> limited births and so on.
See <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Infant </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> , in 1960, there are 250 deaths per 1,000 births, and 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
Another, the life level is improved, and these countries have carried <ERR type=[cc3,1-2]> out </ERR> limited births.
Of course, there are many other reasons <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> these </ERR> .
Health gains in developing countries have gained the important <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> notion </ERR> of the world.
Now, let us give a <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> back </ERR> look <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> on </ERR> the life expectancy of the developing countries in 1960 and 1990.
During the long 30 years, life expectancy rises by 20 <ERR type=[np3,2-]> year </ERR> .
Infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> also proves a <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> truth </ERR> .
In 1960, infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 20 percent.
These countries can have <ERR type=[cc4,-2]> healthy </ERR> , developed hospitals.
Second, in recent years, many countries have formed a lot of birth <ERR type=[np3,4-]> policy </ERR> , and they can get a lot of good things.
From this policy, we have high <ERR type=[fm2,-]> birth-born </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> babies </ERR> .
From the <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> upper </ERR> chart we can see that the life expectancy is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> creasing </ERR> .
From 1960 to 1990, the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Developing </ERR> <ERR type=[np4,-2]> countries </ERR> life expectancy is improving from 40 years old to 80 years old.
At the same time, the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Infant </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is decreasing <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> too </ERR> from 1960 to 1900. <ERR type=[fm3,-]> it's </ERR> deaths ratios has decreased from 250 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why do life expectancy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> crease </ERR> and infant mortality decrease in the these years in developing countries?
There are two <ERR type=[np3,1-]> reason </ERR> about it.
A good medical level can <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> bring </ERR> infant mortality declining and people life extending.
Now, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> In </ERR> developing countries, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> As </ERR> technology <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> developing </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> medical level becomes more and more <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> advance </ERR> , which make people live longer.
After <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> the </ERR> world <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> war </ERR> II, the developing <ERR type=[fm2,-]> countries's </ERR> life level has great improvement, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> encnomic </ERR> level has high <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> development </ERR> , which <ERR type=[vp3,s-][vp1,-s-]> make </ERR> people's life expectancy <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> creasing </ERR> and infant mortality decreasing, too.
Here, I will <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> explore </ERR> some cases on the changes of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
First, let us look at the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> figues </ERR> above.
Both <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> figues </ERR> inform us the difference <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> between </ERR> in 1960 and 1990.
The infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 200 deaths per 1,000 births but in 1990, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Apparently, the life expectancy rises while the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> reduces.
It is a good <ERR type=[np5,2-]> news </ERR> .
The reasons of these changes are: First, because of the development of <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> , the living conditions are improved.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> The </ERR> third, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> secince </ERR> is <ERR type=[vp7,3-1]> developed </ERR> quickly, it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> many fields develop fast, these fields include medicine, living environment and so on .
All <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> people live longer and make infant <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> die </ERR> smaller.
In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old, but the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
In 1990, the life expectancy is 60 years old and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
From the change we can conclude that the developing countries have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> maken </ERR> great progress <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> over </ERR> the 30 years.
Since 1960, the developing countries have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> take </ERR> many measures in economic development, environmental protection.
At the same time, the <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> stander </ERR> of the <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> consumer </ERR> is increased.
The developing countries have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> maken </ERR> such <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> progress, </ERR> they can make greater progress in the future.
With the development of the world's <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> , the conditions of developing countries have made a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> superous </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> progression </ERR> .
The life expectancy and the infant mortality are <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> included </ERR> .
With the development of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> both </ERR> these had made obvious changes.
Both the changes were due to the development of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> and other <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> relative </ERR> aspects of the society.
And with the development of the society, the conditions will become more <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> precious </ERR> than ever.
However, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> In </ERR> 1990, the life expectancy increased.
Why did <ERR type=[pr2,s-]> it </ERR> take place so many changes.
[wd1] Because the medical circumstances have developed which ensures the <ERR type=[np4,-1]> babies </ERR> births.
What's more, people have enough money to buy what they want to eat and <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> which </ERR> will be <ERR type=[ad2,s-]> well </ERR> for their health.
During the past few decades, the <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> health </ERR> of the people of developing countries increased greatly, just as the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> instruction </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,4-1]> telling </ERR> us.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> On </ERR> one hand, from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy in developing countries has <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> went </ERR> from 40 years up to 60 years.
The causes to these changes <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> can </ERR> summarized generally as <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> followed </ERR> .
First, the developing countries have <ERR type=[vp1,-6]> developed </ERR> their economy to a higher level, which <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> according </ERR> increased the living standards of their people.
Second, the medical technology has been greatly <ERR type=[vp9,4-]> went </ERR> up, thus old people could live longer and the infants could grow healthily .
<ERR type=[pr2,s-]> It's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> in </ERR> no doubt that these changes will certainly maintain.
From the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> table </ERR> , in developing <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> counties </ERR> , the trend of both the life expectancy and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is obvious.
From 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy had <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rised </ERR> , while the infant mortality had dropped down greatly.
The life expectancy in 1960 was forty <ERR type=[np3,1-]> year </ERR> old.
In the same year, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 200 deaths per 1000 births, which is very high, in 1990, the life expectancy increased and came to <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> sixties </ERR> years old, <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> twenties </ERR> year more than that of 1960.
Meanwhile, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> diminished by only 100 deaths per 1000 <ERR type=[wd7,7-]> births </ERR> .
Secondly, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> health conditions had been improved greatly.
Thirdly, the life of people <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> were </ERR> better than before, they had enough and nourish food to eat .
There <ERR type=[ad1,1-2]> still </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,2-]> being </ERR> other reasons contributed to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heathy </ERR> gains.
Today, with the development of <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> live </ERR> level in developing countries.
For instance, life expectancy only <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> attained </ERR> 40 in 1960 in China showed in the table.
But in 1990 the situation was changed much, life expectancy has <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> attained </ERR> 60 .
Firstly, developing countries have <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> provided </ERR> some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> policy </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd3,2]> insure </ERR> people's health, they improved people's <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> live </ERR> levels according <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> to </ERR> advancing the productivity.
Secondly, people in developing countries were aware of the importance of health they took exercises and <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> joined </ERR> some sports to make them stronger and stronger .
I believe life expectancy and infant mortality must <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> change </ERR> to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benifit </ERR> to people in the future.
Many changes had taken place about life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in developing countries.
There was a rise <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> about </ERR> life expectancy.
On the other hand, there was a decline about the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> .
In 1960, one-fifth infants died <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> 1000 births, while in 1990, one-tenth infants died.
In addition <ERR type=[wd5,2-2]> to </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Many </ERR> Health organizations had been established so that they protected people from the illness.
It is showed that the life expectancy has increased steadily from 1960 to 1990, and it is also showed that the infant mortality has decreased so quickly since 1960, so the infant mortality <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> on </ERR> the 1990's is half of <ERR type=[pr2,s-]> it </ERR> , in the 1960's .
First, with the development of the national economy in the developing country, the state provides <ERR type=[fm2,-1]> well-condition </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,-]> healthy </ERR> facilities.
Second, people's living has improved rapidly since <ERR type=[np4,-]> 1960's </ERR> .
Third, many <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> lows </ERR> have been <ERR type=[fm2,-]> layed </ERR> down to improve the health.
The <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> last </ERR> , medicine has been improved very much.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> most </ERR> of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> deseases </ERR> can be cured; only rare cases such as cancer can't be cured.
I hope that the people will be <ERR type=[fm2,-]> better-off </ERR> , and the life expectancy become longer and longer, the infant mortality, turn less and less in the developing <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country </ERR> .
Through observation, we can see that the life expectancy in developing countries increased and the infant mortality <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> decreased </ERR> heavily.
The progress of economy and the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> rising </ERR> of living <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> standard </ERR> of the people <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> accounts </ERR> for the change.
From the chart that is shown, we can draw a conclusion that in the period of 1960-1990, there was a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> distincter </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> turning </ERR> in both life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> .
Life expectancy was rising <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> however </ERR> infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is <ERR type=[fm2,-]> belowing </ERR> .
In my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opion </ERR> , there are some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> reason </ERR> for this thing that happened in developing countries.
In 1960, both the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tecnology </ERR> in these countries are poor, they could not provide enough food and <ERR type=[np6,s-]> chemical </ERR> for their people, so the life expectancy is only 40 years old and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 200 deaths per 1000 births .
With the development of the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> periods </ERR> , these countries have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> took </ERR> on a new look.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> have revolutions in science and <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> economic </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> now </ERR> , people have enough money to buy better food and <ERR type=[np6,3-]> chemical </ERR> , and now, their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opion </ERR> of health is changed.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> they </ERR> take all sorts of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> exercise </ERR> to <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> develop </ERR> their body.
As we can see the life expectancy is raised almost 60 year old and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> belowed </ERR> to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Nowdays </ERR> , health gains in developing countries.
We can see it from two aspects as <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> follow </ERR> .
Second, the infant mortality has greatly changed <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> also </ERR> , it has declined by half since 1960 in which it was 200/1000 .
One, after <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-2]> world </ERR> war II, nearly all developing countries in the world have switched their attention to <ERR type=[vp5,5-2]> develop </ERR> their <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> economics </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-s]> without </ERR> war in developing countries people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> con't </ERR> die <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> during </ERR> prime and the <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> conceived </ERR> women can <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> produce </ERR> their babies well.
Life expectancy is more <ERR type=[fm2,-]> enlonging </ERR> in 1960 than that in 1990, while infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> has obviously decreased from 1960 to 1990.
At the same time, we can know that infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> in 1960 was <ERR type=[aj1,-3]> high </ERR> to percent <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> 20 </ERR> , however, until 1990, it decreased to percent <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> 10 </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> The </ERR> first, I think, is the increase in their people's life standard.
In recent years, the developing countries have made great progress in their <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> .
Secondly, <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> medical </ERR> has a rapid development which helps people to live long and make it possible to decline the death of infants.
Thirdly, more and more people begin to <ERR type=[vp1,-]> believe </ERR> science which will be helpful to improve their knowledge of life.
It also can make them know how to protect their <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> bodies </ERR> and to build up their bodies.
This <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> effects </ERR> that the people's life expectancy is high while the infant mortality is low.
As the investigation <ERR type=[vp4,3-]> showing </ERR> , in 1990, life expectancy is 60 years old while in 1960 it was only 40 years old, but the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is 10% in 1990 while 20% in 1960.
Obviously life expectancy is higher than before and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is lower than before.
What <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> lead </ERR> to such <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> affects </ERR> in developing countries?
The first cause is that from 1960 to 1990, the world is peaceful, every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> countries </ERR> are making their <ERR type=[np1,-3]> effort </ERR> into developing products to raise the people's living level.
The second cause is that the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> morden </ERR> medical technologies have improved with the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> morden </ERR> science developing.
The third cause is that there <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> is </ERR> few <ERR type=[np3,1-]> war </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> happened </ERR> in the world .
In a word, during the 30 years, people can live a good <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> living </ERR> and have a good <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> medical </ERR> for their health.
Great improvement of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heath </ERR> has been gained in developing countries.
For example, from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy had been raised from 40 to 60 years old, and infant mortality had declined to half of the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> past </ERR> .
So, <ERR type=[np8,-1]> less </ERR> infants are facing death and people live longer and longer.
The change comes from the two important <ERR type=[np3,2-]> development </ERR> <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> during </ERR> the past, food and medicine.
On the other hand, when they get illness, the <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> development </ERR> medical method can help them survive it, so <ERR type=[np8,-1]> less </ERR> people face death <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> dangerous </ERR> , and can live loner .
To life expectancy, the average age was 40 years old in 1960, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> however </ERR> 60 years old in 1990.
While to infant mortality, in 1960, it reached 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> to </ERR> 1990, it decrease by 50%.
First, with the development of developing countries, people become richer, and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> More </ERR> and more people can afford to see a doctor when they are ill.
For example, governments <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> provide </ERR> much money on medicine, setting up special hospitals.
All this leads to <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> health </ERR> of the developing countries.
From the chart, we could find life expectancy increasingly rise and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> morltaility </ERR> decline from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, life expectancy only <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> have </ERR> forty <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> years </ERR> of age, but it rose to sixty <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> years </ERR> of age.
While infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> a great change.
Each <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> per </ERR> 1000 births deaths have 200 persons in 1960 but it <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> increasingly </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,-]> decline </ERR> 100 persons in 1990.
<ERR type=[wd4,-2]> From </ERR> above facts these <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> changes </ERR> have a <ERR type=[np6,1-]> lots </ERR> of reasons.
The main reason is that these country of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ecnormy </ERR> has <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> literally </ERR> risen in the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lastest </ERR> years.
And the condition of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> medical </ERR> has improved a lot.
With the level of life improving, people take all the sports and build up their <ERR type=[np3,1-]> body </ERR> .
While people have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> controled </ERR> infant mortality with their efforts from 1960.
All the evidence <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> show </ERR> the health <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> improved in developing countries from 1960 to 1990.
<ERR type=[pr1,s-]> They </ERR> will have a brilliant future in health.
But thirty years later, it <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> raised </ERR> rapidly, it became 60 years old in <ERR type=[sn,s-]> 1990 </ERR> .
There are two main factors: First, people's life is changed, the food is enough, few people die from <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> hungry </ERR> , and with the increase of food, people <ERR type=[vp9,-1]> become </ERR> pay more attention to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nutrilist </ERR> structure of food, which <ERR type=[fm1,-]> invoied </ERR> many diseses .
The doctors now can cure many diseases which <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> was </ERR> incurable in the past.
<ERR type=[wd3,-1]> On </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> conclude </ERR> , the change of life expectancy and infant mortality <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> is </ERR> connected with the development of economy and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> technic </ERR> .
From <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> above </ERR> , we can see such a fact: In the developing countries, life expectancy was from 0 <ERR type=[wd5,3-]> to </ERR> 40 years in 1960, while in 1990 from 0 <ERR type=[wd5,3-]> to </ERR> 60 years old; The highest infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960, but in 1990 it was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> in </ERR> a word, life expectancy was increasing, infant mortality was <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> declined </ERR> .
I think that <ERR type=[pr2,s-]> it </ERR> has three reasons: firstly, the people's living level was greatly improved with the development of technology, people can produce more and more highly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nuturious </ERR> food and pay attention to their diet's structur ; Secondly, medical institutes have been set up in recent years.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> applies </ERR> people with all sorts of medicine and keep up their health; thirdly, people can take part in all kinds of relaxation.
They <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> makes </ERR> them happy.
<ERR type=[np1,-3]> Judging </ERR> to the graph, it is very easy to know that the life expectancy in the developing country distinctly improved from <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fourty </ERR> years old in 1960 to <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> the </ERR> sixty years old in 1990.
It <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> increased </ERR> 1.5 times from 1960 to 1990.
On the contrary, the infant mortality <ERR type=[fm1,-]> discreased </ERR> two times from the 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to the 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
The reason that causes the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> transformation </ERR> may lie in three aspects.
Firstly, with the development of the society, the people's life standards <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> increases </ERR> .
Secondly, the government <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> pay </ERR> attention to the health of the people, they offer some money to <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> increase </ERR> the conditions for the people's health, for example, they built some hospitals .
Finally, people often take part in some <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> activities, </ERR> playing football, table-tennis and so on.
So it <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> appears </ERR> the above case.
<ERR type=[pp2,-3]> In </ERR> the same time infant mortality has been <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> decreased </ERR> about 200 deaths per 1,000 births to about 100 deaths per 1000 births.
I think they can be due <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> to </ERR> following facts.
So the government had enough money to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eastablish </ERR> public <ERR type=[fm1,-]> facillities </ERR> , such as hospital, health centre and so on.
With life being bettered, health gains in the world, particularly in developing countries, such as life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> .
In 1960, life expectancy was on the average 40 years old and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> was on the average 200 deaths per 1,000 births while in 1990, life expectancy became on the average 60 years old and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> became on the average 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Food and drink <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> was </ERR> <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> provided </ERR> enough.
House was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> soluted </ERR> .
There are a number of hospitals and advanced equipment was <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> set </ERR> .
Third, people have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> realise </ERR> that sports is important.
To build up their health, people <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> have </ERR> a swim, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> have </ERR> a ball, have a run and so on.
As can be seen from the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> table </ERR> that life expectancy of developing countries has greatly changed.
It <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> rise </ERR> from 40 years old to 60 years old during the period from 1960 to 1990.
First, with the development of economy, the people's life conditions and knowledge have improved, so they have better conditions to live longer, and take good care of <ERR type=[np6,s-]> infant </ERR> .
Secondly, the development of medical <ERR type=[np6,s-][cc2,s-]> system </ERR> could cure more <ERR type=[np3,s-]> disease </ERR> than before.
From the above chart we can see that the life expectancy and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> had changed greatly in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> deveoping </ERR> countries from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy was 40 years old and <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> until </ERR> 1990 it increased to 60 years old, 30 years older in 1990 than in 1960.
However, the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> decreased.
In 1960, 200 <ERR type=[np3,1-]> infant </ERR> <ERR type=[wd1,2-3]> died </ERR> per 1,000 infants and it decreased to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What was the <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> causes </ERR> of the great changes?
The <ERR type=[np5,-]> nutritions </ERR> of foods were more plenty too.
Second, most developing countries paid more attention to their medical <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> structure </ERR> .
I am confident that the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> situtions </ERR> will be better <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> in </ERR> future.
In the 1960s, the life expectancy of the developing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> coutries </ERR> is 40 years old, but in the 1990s, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It </ERR> is 60 years old.
In the 1960s, there are 200 deaths in 1,000 births but in the 1990 <ERR type=[fm3,-]> There </ERR> are only 200 death in 1,000 births.
The people of these countries have no enough food for eating, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> theire </ERR> economy develops very <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> slow </ERR> .
The condition of <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> medical </ERR> of these countries is rather poor.
So, the life expectancy in the 1960s in developing countries is low and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is high.
all the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condation </ERR> has changed.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> theire </ERR> economy and medical <ERR type=[cc2,1-1]> cause </ERR> increase.
People realized that the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heath </ERR> of the body is very important.
So, many changes have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> happed </ERR> .
From the table we can see that, in developing countries, the life expectancy was 40 years in 1960; but in <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> 1990 </ERR> was 60.
That is to say, the life expectancy has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lenghented </ERR> 20 years from 1960 to 1990.
The infant mortality rate was 20% in 1960, which decreased 10% during the thirty years, <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> indicating </ERR> 10% in 1990.
I think there are two reasons for this <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> changing </ERR> .
Secondly with the new technology applying to medicine field, doctors can cope with all kinds of diseases which they used not <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> , which contributes greatly to lengthen just the life expectancy.
I think with the development of the developing countries, the conditions will become better than <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> this </ERR> .
In developing <ERR type=[np6,2-]> country </ERR> , during the time from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy and infant mortality have changed very much.
What did the changes <ERR type=[vp7,d]> bring </ERR> about?
In 1960, in many developing <ERR type=[np3,2-]> country </ERR> , food is inadequate, medical condition is very bad .
They <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> take </ERR> attention to the relation between nutrition and health.
This is the reason of society <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> developing </ERR> , too.
According to the picture, we can get the conclusion that in developing countries, the life expectancy is becoming longer, and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> discreasing </ERR> .
For the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> , in 1960 there is 200 deaths per 1000 births, in 1990, there is only 100 deaths.
The reason that caused these <ERR type=[fm2,-]> changment </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exsits </ERR> in <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pointment </ERR> .
It is the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of the technology that cause the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of people's living level.
Some sickness and <ERR type=[np3,3-]> disease </ERR> can be kept out of the door.
With the <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> developing </ERR> of technology, the life expectancy will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> higer </ERR> , and the infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> will be lower.
We now can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> recgonize </ERR> that it is of <ERR type=[ad2,-1]> most </ERR> importance to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> develope </ERR> technology.
Since the 1960s, health <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> conditioning </ERR> of people has been improved greatly.
Secondly, the progress of medical <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> business </ERR> helps to reduce the infant mortality.
Thirdly, the stability of the developing countries may <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> provide </ERR> the people various comfortable surrounding, which to a certain <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> content </ERR> contributes to <ERR type=[vp5,2-5]> make </ERR> them live better than ever, and in turn adds their life expectancy.
From this picture, we can easily <ERR type=[fm1,-]> obtaine </ERR> that during the past thirty years, life expectancy and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> of the developing countries had <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> taken </ERR> great changes.
As it shows, in 1960 the life expectancy was only 40 years old, and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> even <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> reached </ERR> to 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But till 1990 the life expectancy had increased to 60 years old and infant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mortaility </ERR> had <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> also </ERR> reduced to 100 deaths per 1000 births accordingly.
With the development of the world <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> economic </ERR> , the developing countries also <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strenghthen </ERR> themselves in many <ERR type=[np3,2-]> field </ERR> .
At first they have more sufficient food supply, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strive </ERR> number has reducd .
The <ERR type=[np3,-4]> disease </ERR> , especially the infective illnesses can be controlled.
The third reason is that people <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> has </ERR> become more concerned about their living habits and patterns, which <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> providing </ERR> a more sanitary and comfortable <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviorment </ERR> for themselves.
In recent years, the life expectancy of developing countries is higher than before, while the infant mortality <ERR type=[cc5,-1]> drops </ERR> clearly.
People <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> becomes </ERR> more healthy.
On the contrary, the infant mortality in 1990 was 100 deaths per 1000 births, <ERR type=[cc6,-1]> highly </ERR> lower than 200 deaths in 1960, People's <ERR type=[fm2,-]> lifes </ERR> are longer.
There are three reasons suggested: First, with the development of social <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> , more and more people of developing countries have shaken off poverty.
Second, <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> improve </ERR> medical <ERR type=[cc2,-1]> conditions </ERR> <ERR type=[cc2,3-]> survive </ERR> most of the infants.
Third, fewer wars and the peaceful situation <ERR type=[vp3,6-]> is </ERR> the most important reason.
Now, peace and development are the two most important problems in this world, and developing countries' people will be more healthy than <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> is now.
From this <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> timetable </ERR> , we can observe that the life expectancy increases nearly 20 years old from 40 to 60 and the infant mortality decreases greatly from 200 to 100 at a ratio <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> of </ERR> deaths per 1,000 births.
So we can conclude that health gains in developing countries <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> has </ERR> improved greatly in <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> recent </ERR> decades.
The technology of medicine is improving greatly today, which <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> caused </ERR> the increase of the life expectancy and decline of the infant mortality.
Of course, other factors <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> important to health gains in developing countries.
People take it for granted that fresh water is unlimited, we can <ERR type=[cc3,-6]> get </ERR> no matter how much we want.
It isn't strange that people think so, because they think the resource of fresh water is rich, we also can obtain it in many <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> ways </ERR> rain, river, well and so on.
In fact, shortage of fresh <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> water </ERR> is very serious.
Besides, people keep water <ERR type=[wd1,3-]> polluting </ERR> .
In a word, global shortage of fresh water is one of the most serious <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> problems </ERR> facing us today.
I think people should take some steps to solve this problem, of course, firstly we should protect fresh water <ERR type=[fm1,-]> resouce </ERR> from <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> polluting </ERR> .
Then we have two <ERR type=[np1,2-]> ways </ERR> : one is to reuse water, the other is to change sea water into fresh water.
Researchers have made <ERR type=[np6,2-]> progress </ERR> in this field.
I hope <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> in </ERR> future fresh <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> water </ERR> will not be short any more.
People always take it for granted that fresh water is <ERR type=[cc6,-1]> much </ERR>
We can understand it from the following <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> conditions </ERR> .
Second with the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dvelopment </ERR> of industry, the amount of fresh water used in industry is becoming larger and larger.
What shall we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> do </ERR> with this?
But in <ERR type=[pp2,1-1]> long </ERR> view, we should <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp1,-3]> controll </ERR> the populations rising and find an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enomical </ERR> way to take fresh water from the sea, which covers <ERR type=[wd4,1-4]> most </ERR> surface of the <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Earth </ERR> .
People <ERR type=[vp5,1-s-]> lived </ERR> in the city use cleaned water.
The water factory <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> clean </ERR> the water from rain or rivers and send it to families and other factories.
What <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> make </ERR> matter worse is that factories use more and more fresh water.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Also </ERR> many factories haven't enough facilities to clean the waste water <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> before </ERR> pour it into the river, so some of the rivers are polluted, the water from which can't be used to make fresh water.
And many <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> forests have been cut <ERR type=[cc3,s-]> down </ERR> by human, so the temperature is getting higher than before, so much of the water is changed into steam because of the high temperature.
I think first we shall <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> make </ERR> know to everyone that the fresh water is in shortage.
Third, factories should be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> equiped </ERR> with high-quality facilities to clean the waste water.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Fouth </ERR> , the entire human race should protect the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviroment </ERR> to make a better world for our living.
So, remember that the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> global </ERR> is short of fresh water, don't waste it!
Most of us have <ERR type=[np7,s-]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> concept </ERR> that fresh water is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> normous </ERR> , we can't use it up forever, and we can receive it in many ways: rain water, river water, underground water, etc.
And pollution and population boom also <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> increase </ERR> the emergency.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> we </ERR> should realize the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> gravity </ERR> and come up with some effective <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strageries </ERR> to that problem, reinforce the protection of our fresh water, clean polluted water.
<ERR type=[fm3,1-]> we </ERR> should keep in our minds that every drop of fresh water is precious.
Water, which is the origin of human life, is facing <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> danger </ERR> of shortage.
They may say that there is much fresh water from <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> raining </ERR> , it may also be brought from <ERR type=[np6,s-]> lake </ERR> , <ERR type=[np6,s-]> well </ERR> and so on.
But, as a matter of fact, fresh water is very <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> limit </ERR> .
On the other hand, <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> Because </ERR> of the rapid development of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> indurstry </ERR> , water <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> for </ERR> it increases quickly.
We should make laws to control the birth rate and to prevent <ERR type=[fm1,-]> indurstry </ERR> from <ERR type=[vp5,3-3]> lay </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> out </ERR> dirty water to the lake directly.
People <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-][wd3,s-]> suggested </ERR> that there is enough fresh water on earth.
However, fresh water is in <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> short </ERR> in the world.
The water is <ERR type=[cc5,-5]> used </ERR> by the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fatory </ERR> very much.
The pollution is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> secious </ERR> .
We must <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> solves </ERR> the problem of pollution to save our fresh water and limit the amount of <ERR type=[cc1,3-]> people </ERR> increasing.
The rivers flow year <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> and </ERR> year.
In addition, lots of water sources were polluted and couldn't be <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> use </ERR> .
It is <ERR type=[wd5,-2]> the </ERR> high time for us to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> solute </ERR> this serious problem.
If these steps work, we would have enough water <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> in </ERR> future.
Many people think that <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water will never be used up.
Those people think that since rain and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> river-water </ERR> will be used for ever, <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water will also be used for ever.
In fact, <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water is in a global shortage.
Firstly, with the increase of population, the <ERR type=[cc1,-3]> number </ERR> of <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Water </ERR> <ERR type=[wd1,1-]> Fresh </ERR> to be used <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> increase </ERR> , too: More and more <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water is used <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> to </ERR> people's life.
Secondly, the development of industry <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> call </ERR> for a lot of <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water.
Many <ERR type=[fm1,s-]> factor </ERR> need much <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water to make machines work, to produce products.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Thirdlly </ERR> , pollution is also a factor which leads to the shortage of <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water.
Some factories neglect the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviorment </ERR> .
They let the factories' <ERR type=[fm2,-]> waste-water </ERR> flow into the rivers.
It pollutes the <ERR type=[fm2,s-]> river-water </ERR> .
Fourthly, with the increase of temperature, more and more rivers dry up and the <ERR type=[cc1,-2]> number </ERR> of rain also <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> decrease </ERR> .
Should we make best use of <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water?
It is certainly <ERR type=[np7,s-]> the </ERR> important factor.
To make best use of <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Fresh </ERR> Water is the duty of every citizen.
Secondly, to protect the neat <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviorment </ERR> is also important.
I think a piece <ERR type=[np9,2-1]> of </ERR> law should be <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> made </ERR> that the factory which let its <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wate-water </ERR> flow into the <ERR type=[np6,s-]> river </ERR> should be punished!
Many people may think that the fresh water will <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> never </ERR> out <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> using.
And there is <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> raining </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> snowing </ERR> in many places.
Perhaps some <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> one </ERR> may think there is a lot of ice in the south and north of the earth.
However, there <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> is </ERR> global shortage of fresh water.
But water <ERR type=[fm1,-]> polution </ERR> is more and more serious in our society.
For example, factories <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> give </ERR> the waste water into rivers and lakes, and many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> field </ERR> can not be <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> watered </ERR> with the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> poluted-water </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Otherwise </ERR> , global shortage of fresh water is also because of the increasing population.
First, we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> may </ERR> not waste the fresh water.
Second, <ERR type=[np6,s-]> measure </ERR> should be taken to keep the water from <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp7,s-]> poluting </ERR> .
Above all, we may have a right <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> situation </ERR> to the shortage of fresh water.
<ERR type=[ad1,-3]> Often </ERR> people want to finish something more quickly, but <ERR type=[ad1,-3]> often </ERR> they can not do it well.
Thus, the things he (she) has done is in bad <ERR type=[fm1,-]> quanlity </ERR> , even nothing good can be found in the things.
Haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,s-]> make </ERR> you can't <ERR type=[cc3,-4]> think </ERR> about the thing enough, haste may make you excited or nervous, so you can't think carefully about what you must do, what you mustn't do and what method will be the best.
Or you may forget something important, it <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> make </ERR> you can't do what you will do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucess </ERR> .
For example, one morning you get up <ERR type=[ad3,s-]> later </ERR> , and you will be late <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> to </ERR> your work, so you are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasted </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> you </ERR> run down the stairs and run to your car then you find that you have left the key in the room.
And on the way to factory, because of haste you crash <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> to </ERR> the tree on the side of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stree </ERR> ....
So, by the end, you are <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> be </ERR> late.
Why do we usually say Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste?
It contains a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> commen </ERR> reason that we should do everything step by step.
But in the condition of without enough <ERR type=[fm1,-]> proporate </ERR> situation we can not do the thing that we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oppricated </ERR> .
For example, in economic <ERR type=[fm1,-]> areana </ERR> people usually want to get advanced technology and management.
So people <ERR type=[wd3,-6]> quote </ERR> many work lines from other country.
But without adequate knowledge to use them, parts of them are lain out of the <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> way </ERR> .
Thus we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wast </ERR> large <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> exchange </ERR> .
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" is on old saying.
For example, if you want to <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> get </ERR> a place by bicycle, but there is something wrong with the bicycle, before you begin using it, and you don't fix it.
So it will not work probably <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> on </ERR> the half way to the place, finally you will be late or can't get there.
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" is a good saying, we must remember it.
Every thing has its own <ERR type=[wd3,-]> regularity </ERR> .
When we want to do things more quickly, we should know their <ERR type=[wd3,-]> regularity </ERR> , and <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> give </ERR> a conclusion to them.
But the <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> regularity </ERR> is objective, not <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> revert </ERR> by the man's idea.
When we break the <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> regularity </ERR> , haste makes waste.
[wd7,s-]
We can see many things <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> embody </ERR> this theory.
When we cook, we make the fire big in order to eat the meat <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fast </ERR> .
But, when we eat it, we find it <ERR type=[vp3,3-][cc5,-1]> taste </ERR> ugly.
I think <ERR type=[pr2,s-]> it </ERR> is "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
[wd4,-2] Other example, when we study history so many history books are in front of you, you want to be <ERR type=[np7,s-]> the </ERR> historian, so you read them one after one, not break .
At last you read them all, but, so <ERR type=[np8,-1]> many </ERR> knowledge in your mind only <ERR type=[vp3,7-]> lead </ERR> you <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> into </ERR> nothing.
You spent so much time, but get nothing, it is the same words "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
So we should not <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> to do the thing, we must depend on our own base.
So it's necessary to illustrate and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> demostrate </ERR> that haste makes waste.
In everyday life, we often have to do many things in <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> limit </ERR> time, and we have to <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> catch </ERR> the time.
If we want to do them as <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> quick </ERR> as we can, we will become <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nerveous </ERR> and won't finish them in time.
So haste makes us <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nerveous </ERR> and disable us to do many things well.
They may forget to <ERR type=[vp1,1-2]> look </ERR> their house or to bring the key with them or to make their clothes well which often produces many jokes.
All these are <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> resulted </ERR> from their haste to reach <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> office </ERR> .
If we are under limited conditions, we should <ERR type=[wd3,-4]> have </ERR> it in our minds that will make us do our things better.
The old saying "haste makes <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> waste" </ERR> is very familiar to us.
First, one that wants to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> in a hurry often can't stop to think about the best way to success.
Third, as is <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> know </ERR> to us, a good rest is very important for one to reach success.
Whoever <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> keens </ERR> on success will <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> neglect </ERR> rest and do everything ineffectively.
For example, Li Ming, one of my classmates, who <ERR type=[vp3,7-]> want </ERR> to get a good mark on CET 4, spared every moment to study English.
In the morning after he gets up, he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> began </ERR> reading English with a piece of bread in his hands.
At night, he often stayed up <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> to </ERR> 12 o'clock.
Unfortunately the day before CET 4 test he passed <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> out </ERR> and couldn't attend the exam.
In general, we must keep calm in front of success, <ERR type=[cc5,-2]> consider </ERR> everything well and think out a best way to success.
People always <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> thinks </ERR> that finishing things as fast as you can is a good thing.
In some cases, we have something important to do, but we have not enough <ERR type=[np6,s-]> times </ERR> , for example, we want to finish a drawing which <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> have </ERR> to be turned in.
If we do it <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> in </ERR> high speed, the drawing you finished is not a good one.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> or </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> else </ERR> , you like <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plantting </ERR> , but the tree can't <ERR type=[vp9,1-][wd3,s-]> brings </ERR> up in days.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> In </ERR> this <ERR type=[np5,2-]> times </ERR> , we say "Haste makes waste" then, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> How </ERR> can we avoid "Haste makes waste"?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> must take account <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> in </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> rude </ERR> of other.
We must base on the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> practise </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Obousing </ERR> the fact, doing our best, making use of <ERR type=[np5,3-]> times </ERR> , "Haste makes waste" will not happen any more.
When somebody does his work hastily, the more he want to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> , the more he couldn't <ERR type=[cc5,s-]> do </ERR> his work with patience.
As a result he could never <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> success </ERR> his work as he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> .
For example, when we want to <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> fixture </ERR> a bicycle, we should do this with patience.
Otherwise we must <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> spent </ERR> more time doing it on the contrary we want.
<ERR type=[ad1,s-]> Also </ERR> , when we want to work hastily, we couldn't concentrate on doing it.
This is <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> the </ERR> why haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> waste too.
For example we want to read a book quickly, thus, we couldn't <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> spent </ERR> more time concentrating on it.
We can work well with the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> brieve </ERR> that haste makes waste.
Everything can be done well in a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pamtience </ERR> way, that is: "There is a will, there is a way," People must do <ERR type=[np6,s-]> thing </ERR> with <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condience </ERR> , nothing can be done well in a hurry <ERR type=[wd5,3-]> way </ERR> , when we do business, study and do experiment, with <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> filled </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condience </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pamtience </ERR> are very important.
If we want to do something well in a <ERR type=[fm1,-1]> sort </ERR> time, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> will make wrong, that is, haste makes waste.
Because things have a course of development, and most things have to be done in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> serveral </ERR> steps, especially, when we do something, there is a time before success, for example, we can't grasp <ERR type=[fm3,-]> english </ERR> grammar in a day; we can't reach the moon in a step; and we have to study for years before go to college.
Everything <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> to be done well in a <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> course </ERR> .
In conclusion, things can be done well if we have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pamtience </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condience </ERR> , but haste makes waste.
I will make more mistakes when I <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> haste </ERR> .
Because the anxiety <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> disturbs </ERR> me that I can't concentrate in my operation.
Moreover, there are many accidents <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> affect </ERR> our life.
As I <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> determine </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> , I will find that I have to face these accidents which I can't <ERR type=[cc3,4-]> resolve </ERR> .
At last, I will fail to <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> arrive </ERR> my object.
Once I took part in <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> examine </ERR> .
I wanted to finish it quickly and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> go </ERR> to attend a party.
We often say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste," but what <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,s-1]> its </ERR> means?
Let us suppose you just want to reach <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,-]> object </ERR> , you <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> too serious to realize what you want, so you will spend all <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> of </ERR> you have had in order to finish the thing.
But when you try, you will find <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> out </ERR> that you do not reach your <ERR type=[wd7,-]> object </ERR> , and you may turn back.
It is "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
We can have <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> example.
In our country, 30 years ago, the country <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> masters </ERR> wanted to reach the object -- every one can get what he want, so they called on the people to do many things we could not realize.
The truth proved what they had decided was wrong, the <ERR type=[cc2,-2]> lesson </ERR> is hard.
What does the words --"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Makes </ERR> waste" mean?
It's not <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffictcal </ERR> for you to guess its meaning.
That is, if you do something in a hurry <ERR type=[wd5,3-]> way </ERR> , you often can't get your <ERR type=[fm1,-]> attain </ERR> .
That is to say, whatever goals you want to <ERR type=[cc3,4-]> gain </ERR> , you should have enough patience and do everything step by step.
Then, let me give you <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> example to illustrate it.
If you force yourself to do many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> exercise </ERR> , and to learn hundreds of words everyday, you think you can learn English well in a short period?
Because you only pay your <ERR type=[fm1,-]> atention </ERR> on the haste, but ignore the way.
[wd7,s-]
And why it <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> is </ERR> true?
From my experience, I do exercises very quickly in order to <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> make </ERR> some time for enjoying music, but I always find that there are many <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> wrongs </ERR> in them, then I am forced to find them out and correct them, and it takes me even more time than that of doing them at <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> common </ERR> speed.
<ERR type=[wd3,-s-]> They </ERR> are many events in history <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> show </ERR> the truth of "haste makes waste".
From the phrase "haste makes waste", we can learn much more than what I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> had </ERR> said.
We should do <ERR type=[np6,s-]> thing </ERR> according to their properties, and we should not only seek <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> less </ERR> time.
Wanting to do something quickly but <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> make </ERR> a mess in the end, that is what calls "Haste makes waste".
When a man is so <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> eagerly </ERR> to finish something in a hurry, what <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> loads </ERR> his mind might be "quick, quick and quick"; then he will forget to think over every aspects of the whole situation <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comprehesively </ERR> , he will forget to make preparations <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> necessary </ERR> .
To make it even worse, because he is in such a hurry that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> careliness </ERR> and patience needed in doing the work are rare.
Then, the only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> consequense </ERR> will be a mess.
" Once a father told his two sons to cut down some branches and gave them each a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> steeny </ERR> knife.
The first one took the knife immediately <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> onto </ERR> the forest in order to be back sooner than the other.
But the second one took a look at the knife first, then <ERR type=[fm1,-]> trid </ERR> to make it sharp despite his brother's going working earlier.
[wd4,-3] The afternoon, the second one went home with many branches, but the first one came home very late and had <ERR type=[np8,-1]> little </ERR> branches, and said, "the knife isn't sharp <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> completely </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd7,s-]> " </ERR>
So, when you want to do something well, you must not <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> but make sure everything <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> have </ERR> been prepared.
For example, in <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> studying </ERR> , we often want to be the first at once, however, if we don't study hard for a long time, there is no doubt that this is impossible.
The <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> improve </ERR> of community <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> economy </ERR> is the same reason, if there aren't enough <ERR type=[fm1,-]> foundments </ERR> of industry and agriculture in one country, this <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> improve </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> don't </ERR> come into <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ture </ERR> at once, instead, this action of improving is dangerous.
[wd7,s-]
From the above <ERR type=[wd5,2-]> following </ERR> , we can say: "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
Many people know there is an old saying "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
They always think that the more quickly they do <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sth </ERR> , the more achievement they will get.
Because when we do <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sth </ERR> , we should make a plan first, and obey many rules.
Or we will be at a loss, not knowing what should <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> do </ERR> and what should not <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> do </ERR> .
Just when the class was over, I heard the teacher saying " <ERR type=[pr2,s-]> it </ERR> would be an exam the next day, then I felt quite nervous.
As soon as I came back home, I brought out all the maths books and <ERR type=[cc3,2-1]> learned </ERR> it very carefully.
I was still <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> learning </ERR> deep into the night.
But the next day, when I get the exam paper, I was worried, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Because </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It </ERR> was not the maths exam paper, but an English one.
From the thing I have experienced, I know that when we want to succeed, we should remember "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" at any time.
And we should do things more <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> careful </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Before </ERR> , we had <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> thought </ERR> if we did something fast, we could get a good result, in fact, this idea is false.
Once, you decide to do something <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucessful </ERR> you must put your heart into it, you must think of every details, you must spend much time on it, then you will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucessful </ERR> .
Otherwise, you would be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fature </ERR> .
For example, when we study English, at the beginning we started to learn English words, every day we must learn it, slowly and <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> slowly </ERR> we master more and more words, then we <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> learned </ERR> use of <ERR type=[np6,1-]> sentence </ERR> , we can speak English sometimes.
But <ERR type=[wd5,-s-]> it's </ERR> for me, this term I seldom learned it until last week, this week I studied it all day and all night.
[wd7,s-] But now I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> couldn't </ERR> do the paper well.
We often make this fault, when we do something, we always hope it finish more <ERR type=[ad3,1-]> better </ERR> more <ERR type=[ad3,1-]> sooner </ERR> .
This mood <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> makes </ERR> us <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> going </ERR> in an anxious state.
The progress of the work is <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> slow </ERR> down.
Then, we became more and more <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> anxiously </ERR> .
The terrible <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> circle </ERR> is formed.
There are a lot of examples in our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> daylife </ERR> .
When I must face <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> to </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> final-exam </ERR> , I have to <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> review </ERR> all the knowledge <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> what </ERR> I have learned in this term.
With the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> examing </ERR> day coming <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fast </ERR> , I still have many works to do.
I can't finish one thing if I still stick to <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> use </ERR> this method.
I must start from one thing and finish it before I have <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> to </ERR> another thing.
Only in this way, I can make my study <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> effectively </ERR> .
A <ERR type=[fm1,-]> provd </ERR> says, "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
It means that sometimes people are anxious to achieve some thing, but because of carelessness or the other <ERR type=[np6,4-]> reason </ERR> , they usually fail in the end.
The phenomenon often <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> happen </ERR> in people's everyday life, for instance, three years <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> before </ERR> when I studied <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> high school.
I <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> wanted </ERR> to go home on bicycle every other weekend.
Once it being dark, I'm so afraid of being caught in rain that I <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> drove </ERR> faster and faster.
But in the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> cross-road </ERR> , I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> injuried </ERR> slightly, when the bicycle was turned over.
To make the matter worse, the parcel of books on the back of <ERR type=[np6,1-]> bike </ERR> was unwrapped and all books were scattered into <ERR type=[fm1,-]> apects </ERR> .
It took me half an hour to pick up <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> them </ERR> .
At last, it was <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> still </ERR> at seven in the evening when I arrived at <ERR type=[np6,2-]> house </ERR> .
Therefore, when we wanted to finish some thing in a short time, we must <ERR type=[wd7,-5]> make </ERR> good <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> caution </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> do </ERR> with accidents.
Only if we do so, we <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> can </ERR> attain our aims.
When someone <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> in a work, he may be <ERR type=[ad3,s-]> much </ERR> careless than usual.
So some mistakes will be made by him, which just <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> waste </ERR> his time at work.
For instance, in ancient China there <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> a scholar <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> planned </ERR> to enter a city before sunset because the city door would be closed then.
Judged from the distance, it was possible for him to get there <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> with </ERR> normal speed.
But he just <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasted </ERR> , and the books on the back of his horse which he <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> drove </ERR> fell to the ground.
After he <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> piled </ERR> up the books, <ERR type=[pr2,s-]> it </ERR> was not enough time to reach the city then.
So he wanted to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> just waste time.
But you <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> and are too careless to take something important with you.
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" is a saying that is used often by people.
But why we say" Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste"?
[wd7,s-] The first is people are too eager to <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> make </ERR> success, the second is people make <ERR type=[wd7,1-]> acts </ERR> when they don't find out good ways.
<ERR type=[pp2,-2]> At </ERR> this condition, good <ERR type=[fm2,-]> wishs </ERR> always don't bring good effect.
For example, in 1950's, the people in China were too eager to make our country in <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> to </ERR> a strong <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mordenizational </ERR> country, our leaders adopted the strategy of <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "The </ERR> great leap".
This strategy was very <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unthoughtful </ERR> .
So this strategy didn't bring our country <ERR type=[fm2,-]> advicements </ERR> , but also <ERR type=[fm2,-][cc5,-4]> destroied </ERR> our country very much.
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> "Hates </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> make </ERR> our many <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> regrets </ERR> , we should <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> make </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lessins </ERR> in our life and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stuies </ERR> .
Many people want to do something very quickly, and with little <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> of </ERR> difficulties.
But, in fact, they can't <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> realize </ERR> their aims.
There is a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> raison </ERR> : Haste makes waste.
Firstly, we must <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> consider </ERR> of the situation where we are.
We can't do something <ERR type=[cc2,1-3]> that </ERR> is impossible to manage.
When we want <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> to </ERR> something quickly, we often lose patience, and this will make our work more difficult.
Finally, there are many other causes, such as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> capablity </ERR> , money, circumstance, help from other people.
If we are impatient, we usually lose our <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> heads </ERR> and can't think of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> them </ERR> .
So, all we try to do will <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> becomes </ERR> a kind of waste, a waste of force of man, a waste of money and a waste of time.
A student doesn't study well, but he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to catch up with the others in a short time.
<ERR type=[np6,-s]> Times </ERR> passes <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> away </ERR> , but he finds he can't do so.
It's only a simple example, there are many others in our <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> vie </ERR> .
And we can realize what we want to do much more <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> facile </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> possible </ERR> .
People always say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Wast </ERR> ," and I think it is very reasonable.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Whichever </ERR> we wanted to do, we should do it step by step and <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> can't </ERR> impatient.
If we always complete it in <ERR type=[ad2,-1]> very </ERR> haste, we often make many mistakes even <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> fails </ERR> .
For example, we study English, if you want to grasp this language in <ERR type=[np8,-1]> few </ERR> time and I think it is impossible <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> of </ERR> you to learn it well, because English as a subject you should know English new words by heart, study English <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> and <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> practice </ERR> English spoken abilities and so on, and all this must spend your <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> plenty </ERR> time in <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> grasping </ERR> .
So, I think "Haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> waste" is a good guidance for us to do anything.
In our <ERR type=[fm2,-]> socialty </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> , </ERR> Livings are progressing so fast that everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> believe </ERR> time is money.
As a <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> reason </ERR> , we hurry to do everything we need to do.
But to our <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> disappoint </ERR> , the facts often are different <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> with </ERR> our ideal <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> thinks </ERR> .
Let me tell you a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phenomenom </ERR> in our studying <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> living </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,-1]> When </ERR> examination, many students think time is not enough, so they finish papers fast then hand in <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> them </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pr1,s-]> They </ERR> told us that haste makes waste.
If we think carefully of it, we'll conclude that everything <ERR type=[wd5,1-6]> being </ERR> completed successfully must be prepared well.
Merely <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persuiting </ERR> haste will lead to failure <ERR type=[fm1,-]> innevitably </ERR> .
It's the same with our socialist, at first, we declared that <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> we'll </ERR> enter <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> communicate </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sociatist </ERR> in three months.
History proved it's impossible, so today, our government go to a right <ERR type=[fm1,-]> steadly </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,5-]> way </ERR> .
[wd7,s-]
Some people think that we must do everything as <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> quick </ERR> as possible, but is that <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> be </ERR> so?
We all know the proverb <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Haste </ERR> makes waste.
It tells us that sometimes speed is not the most important <ERR type=[np3,s-]> things </ERR> .
Whether we prepare enough or not directly <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> influents </ERR> our outcome.
Good <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> prepares </ERR> need a <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> certain </ERR> time.
For example, once doing <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> experiment, I wanted to finish it in a very short time.
So I did <ERR type=[pp2,-3]> in </ERR> a high speed.
But after I finished, I found that there were something <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> importance </ERR> I had left out.
So we can say that what it is important is how <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> good </ERR> not how <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> quick </ERR> we do a thing.
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" is an old Chinese saying.
You <ERR type=[vp9,-3]> must </ERR> step by step, and you will laugh at last.
Why do people say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste"?
You must <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> obey </ERR> to it, but not neglect it.
When you have great <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> willing </ERR> to finish it, you should set your <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> heart </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> peacely </ERR> , <ERR type=[cc3,-5]> arrange </ERR> all <ERR type=[pr4,-2]> you </ERR> whole matters correctly and then do it, otherwise, you will waste more time, even go backward for the <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> factor </ERR> you had done wrong.
That would prevent you from <ERR type=[fm1,-]> accompolising </ERR> them on <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> time </ERR> you predicted.
For example, in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nighteen </ERR> sixties, our country had set up a wrong routine, which <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> called </ERR> "Great progress".
So they took everything that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comsist </ERR> of iron into steel plant, in order to change them into steel.
But the result <ERR type=[vp3,1-][wd3,s-]> approve </ERR> that it's a great <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> wrong </ERR> .
And after "Great progress" even our <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> country </ERR> backward a lot.
<ERR type=[wd2,-1]> History </ERR> experience <ERR type=[vp4,s-][wd3,s-]> alarming </ERR> people "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
So, remember that old saying "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
Because if you <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> , you always leave out a lot of details, for example, you want to improve your "comprehensive reading in a short term, so you do a lot of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> problem </ERR> in an hour, but you'll find <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it's </ERR> still poor.
That's because you too <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> that can't do a lot of details such as how to catch the main ideas, how to guess a word's meaning etc.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> knowing </ERR> this you'll find that you improve little by little.
That's one of the <ERR type=[np3,3-]> reason </ERR> why haste makes waste.
There are some other <ERR type=[np3,2-]> reason </ERR> .
So when we do a work, we don't <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> .
Because when you want to finish an important thing in a quick way, you always can not think <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> of </ERR> a correct way or a wonderful method carefully.
Now I <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> tell </ERR> you below: the <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> mean </ERR> of <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> the </ERR> haste makes waste is if you want to do something, the haste will lead to failure or make you have to spend more time in finishing it.
The reason is that you lose your <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> patient </ERR> and you didn't consider it carefully before you do something, such makes waste.
For example, if you want to build a high house, you must build it from the first <ERR type=[fm1,-]> flore </ERR> to the highest <ERR type=[fm1,-]> flore </ERR> .
If you want to build the highest <ERR type=[fm1,-]> flore </ERR> without the first <ERR type=[fm1,-]> flore </ERR> , I think, that is impossible.
So you must build <ERR type=[pr4,-1]> you </ERR> house step by step with good <ERR type=[np6,2-]> material </ERR> , otherwise, you can't finish it.
Since we have known the reason why haste makes waste clearly, why we <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> can't </ERR> use it?
An idiom says that <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> makes waste".
Everything, and every process <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> has </ERR> its own course.
Sometimes if we want to fasten <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> , we only spoil it.
In <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> this </ERR> way, we prevent it from developing in its due course.
Perhaps that's the reason why haste makes waste -- we'll waste our energy, time and money if we <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> impropely </ERR> .
I have some painful experiences on <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
<ERR type=[vp6,s-]> Did </ERR> you ever climb a hill?
But since I'm not strong enough, I am exhausted at merely the <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> half </ERR> the distance.
The result is that I am always the last one to <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> get </ERR> the summit.
<ERR type=[pr2,s-]> That's </ERR> the same <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> in </ERR> our study.
It's impossible for us to see <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> English word and remember it at first sight.
Many people may <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> think </ERR> haste as a good thing.
But in fact, haste usually makes waste, as is different with their <ERR type=[wd7,5-]> ideas </ERR> .
Many people had <ERR type=[vp6,-s-]> wanted </ERR> to finish something quickly.
On account of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> , they acts, but not as usual <ERR type=[wd5,5-]> methods </ERR> .
So they cut down some important materials, even which act key <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> uses </ERR> .
Things develop <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> as </ERR> their <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> ruler </ERR> .
But haste making waste damages this <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> ruler </ERR> .
So it is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> certant </ERR> that haste makes waste.
Why, to finish a thing <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> need </ERR> some time to prepare, to do carefully.
If for less <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> time, </ERR> there would be <ERR type=[fm2,-]> somethings </ERR> neglected.
Because of the absence of these <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nessisary </ERR> things, the object won't be realized, and the other things we have done are <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> waste </ERR> .
In our study some students read the English words all day and all night in order to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> maste </ERR> the English in the least time.
<ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> they </ERR> waste much time.
Because the English study doesn't only <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> meant </ERR> reading words, but grammar and others.
Furthermore, they <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> don't </ERR> remember too many words, for it is only in use that they can remember them.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> that </ERR> is "Haste makes waste" also.
In my <ERR type=[np3,2-]> opinions </ERR> , haste usually makes waste.
Because, as to the <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> subjective </ERR> world, everything has its own principle of development.
They <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> adherent </ERR> to the principles, which means we should pay <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> good </ERR> attention to the principles.
On the other hand, as far as man is concerned, haste sometimes leads to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nevious </ERR> state.
<ERR type=[wd3,-3]> As </ERR> my own experience, one day, when I was doing my housework, my friends called me to play football half an hour later.
In order to finish the job within thirty <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mintes </ERR> , I did the housework very quickly with little <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> think </ERR> .
At last, although I finished the work on time, I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> criticed </ERR> by my teacher the next day.
If we will only pay more attention to the rules of things' development and be more <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> carefully </ERR> , we could get good results.
Second, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> If </ERR> you want to finish doing something quickly, you must be too nervous to work properly.
When these things happen, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> She </ERR> must do it again.
First, we always need some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> indispensible </ERR> preparations before we manage to finish a task.
It seems that these <ERR type=[np3,1-]> work </ERR> are unnecessary, but they are often essential for the success in the future.
On the other side, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> If </ERR> we want to reach our goal, we must follow the right instruction properly.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Sometime </ERR> , even if you omit a minor step, the whole thing will fail and you have to start all over again from the very beginning.
In fact, it is a waste of time to finish work in a hurry and come out <ERR type=[wd3,2-4]> with </ERR> a bad outcome.
As a <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> long </ERR> saying, haste makes waste.
" On many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> occassions </ERR> , we may need to do things of our own <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> time, </ERR> but <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> on </ERR> the end, we may fail because we do them in a hurry.
<ERR type=[pr5,s-]> What </ERR> did this happen?
First, haste makes us impatient, and there are more chances that we <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> do </ERR> some mistakes.
Furthermore, haste to some extent <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> causes </ERR> more time, more energy and even more material.
In addition, the water must be added more and <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> more </ERR> .
In order to do it <ERR type=[fm2,-]> quicklier </ERR> , I at a <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> blow </ERR> added 500 ml water to the medicine, and then stir it quickly.
What it <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> is </ERR> now?
Even I stir <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> so </ERR> hard, still some medicine <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disolved </ERR> .
<ERR type=[pr5,s-]> How </ERR> can I do now?
This time I added the water by and <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> by </ERR> and I finished the experiment in the end.
When you are doing some research, when you are a real <ERR type=[fm1,-]> practicer </ERR> , please remember "haste makes waste".
"Haste makes <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> " is a common idiom.
When you act against the principles, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> then </ERR> , what you do can only bring you the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opposit </ERR> result.
Although this idiom is known widely, people tend to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> spontaneously or unconsciously.
The <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> reason </ERR> may be the following two points.
Second, if you <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> are </ERR> hurry, you must be impatient.
And the difficulty will often <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> can't </ERR> be solved.
When he <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> get </ERR> to school, he found he had forgotten to take the homework which will be handed <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> on </ERR> .
Because he was too <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> hurry </ERR> to get the homework, he was late at last.
The saying tells us that before you want to do something <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> successful </ERR> , you <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> won't </ERR> do it in a hurry.
<ERR type=[pr2,s-]> It's </ERR> an old saying that: Haste makes waste.
No matter which country you are <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> come </ERR> from, you must be familiar with it.
So what <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,2-5]> make </ERR> peoples <ERR type=[vp4,2-]> drew </ERR> that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conclution </ERR> ?
Imagine that you are struggling in the crowd of people, who are eager to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> registe </ERR> at the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> begining </ERR> of a term.
You'd filled the form as quickly as you could, and now you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> at the head of a long line.
You have to go back and <ERR type=[wd5,4-]> to </ERR> wait for <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> unbearable long time!
Then one of your <ERR type=[np3,3-]> classmate </ERR> , who <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> are </ERR> now at the head of the line, speaks to you with a <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> big </ERR> smile on his face: "Hi, haste makes waste!
Since when people are in a haste, they often can't think <ERR type=[fm1,-]> throughly </ERR> about the situation, so that's common for them to make a lot of mistakes.
Remember that old saying: Haste makes waste, and think twice before you make up your mind to do something, then you'll undoubtedly achieve more than you ever <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> expected </ERR> .
Sometimes old sayings can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> helps </ERR> a lot.
[wd4,-2] <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Comporatoary </ERR> days, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efficience </ERR> plays essential <ERR type=[np6,2-]> role </ERR> in competitive <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> cases </ERR> , which people crazily <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persue </ERR> .
For one thing, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unmature </ERR> proposition and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> uncorrect </ERR> assay will often be projected in haste.
[wd7,s-] They should actually lead to a bad result; Secondly, haste <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> uncertainly </ERR> makes more <ERR type=[np3,1-]> product </ERR> or more profits, <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> but </ERR> waste.
High quality could <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> makes </ERR> more profits than great quantity.
A <ERR type=[wd2,-3]> bankrupting </ERR> of one enterprise can be exemplified as <ERR type=[fm3,-2]> "Haste </ERR> makes Waste".
It gets good reputation in <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> social </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> earilier </ERR> .
Its <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> productive </ERR> are all over the world.
For some reasons, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> producting </ERR> speed was improved to get more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efficiences </ERR> .
Firstly, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> takes more profit by <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> .
But, later, people find that most of <ERR type=[pr4,-1]> it </ERR> products were fake.
And it <ERR type=[vp3,1-][vp1,1-]> bankrupt </ERR> !
In a <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> world </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-2]> ,"Haste </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> make </ERR> Waste".
As the <ERR type=[cc2,-1]> proverb </ERR> says "Haste Makes Waste".
If we have too big ambition and want to succeed in a short time, we'll fail in the end unless <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> by </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-2]> a </ERR> evil way.
And we have <ERR type=[cc3,2-4]> to </ERR> be waste of time.
After some time, they not only make <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> not </ERR> development, but also find the errors in homework increase even the speed of reading improves.
Some traffic accidents are also caused by the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> reason </ERR> .
Drivers <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> dive </ERR> fast and have no <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> time </ERR> avoid colliding when finding other vehicles come to them.
If we notice, we can <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> find </ERR> the proverb around us.
Everyone <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to succeed in any position, but we should plan to <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> accomplishment </ERR> according to what we are <ERR type=[wd7,5-]> really </ERR> .
We should remember the proverb whatever we <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> do </ERR> , and use it in our daily life.
"Haste makes <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> " is very reasonable <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scentence </ERR> .
If somebody wants to do something quickly, he thinks all about how to increase speed in his mind, so he is <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> easily </ERR> to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> neglact </ERR> something important and useful that sometimes determine whether he can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compelete </ERR> the thing successfully.
Therefore, he can not do the thing well and he must do it again, More time has been wasted <ERR type=[fm2,-]> insteads </ERR> of high speed.
But a few days <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> after </ERR> , they find those new words are still new words, we should study new words <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gradully </ERR> .
We learn a few words a day and after some time we have to review them again and several times we can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> crasp </ERR> them <ERR type=[fm1,-]> formly </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Hast </ERR> makes waste.
For one thing, people do something which <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> were </ERR> not thought over often result in failures .
Because people want <ERR type=[fm2,-]> haster </ERR> , they must spend less time in preparing for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nessisary </ERR> thing; for another thing, some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> difficutys </ERR> should be <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> thought </ERR> before people do a thing, yet, people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persure </ERR> haste and forget these <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> difficult </ERR> , so, when they confronted them, they had no ideas.
Finally, <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> something </ERR> must have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plent </ERR> of time to do.
Study is a case in point, learning knowledge is a long-run <ERR type=[wd7,-]> course </ERR> .
From <ERR type=[fm1,-]> primany </ERR> school to high school, and from high school to college, we have <ERR type=[cc3,-5]> learned </ERR> a great deal of knowledge which couldn't <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> acquire </ERR> in short time.
If you <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> become a college student in short <ERR type=[wd7,-]> terms </ERR> .
You must <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> learn </ERR> knowledge from <ERR type=[fm2,-]> begining </ERR> .
So haste makes waste, it is a truth for everything we want for <ERR type=[wd7,6-]> ever </ERR> .
There is an old saying:" Haste makes waste," <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> It </ERR> says that when you are doing something, you can't be in too much haste, or you will get an <ERR type=[fm2,-]> inexpective </ERR> result.
For example, many students want to pass the Band-six college English <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> text </ERR> , but in the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> text </ERR> , they were so <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> intensive </ERR> that they <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> forget </ERR> many words <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> what </ERR> they had accumulated, they finished quickly but at <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> once </ERR> made a lot of mistakes.
The Culture Revolution gave our nation a lesson that Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
We didn't know <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> step-by-step </ERR> -- we were too eager to turn our ideal into reality, the result of which make our country fall back.
People often say," Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
On some occasions, though we want to get one thing done well and quickly, it turns out that we <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> fail </ERR> to it.
The <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hastilier </ERR> you get along <ERR type=[cc3,2-2]> with </ERR> a thing, the more waste time you will get.
[wd7,s-]
Because you can't make a full <ERR type=[fm1,-]> preperation </ERR> for the thing you are going to do in such a short time.
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Therefor </ERR> , "Haste makes waste.
For instance, once when I was in an exam, I wanted to finish the paper quickly, so I did not hear what the teacher had told the <ERR type=[np3,s-]> student </ERR> .
Otherwise you will <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> lose </ERR> it.
In an old <ERR type=[np3,2-]> sayings </ERR> , that is "Haste makes waste".
[wd7,s-] Since he was afraid, how could he do something well?
[wd7,s-] Moreover, while one is <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> , he may want to do something in <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> another </ERR> ways.
Since he is <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> to change his minds.
But if we want to pass it yet just prepare it <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hastely </ERR> , of course, we can't go over most of the books carefully.
As a result, <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> we </ERR> might be difficult to pass it.
After all, if we want to do anything <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> success </ERR> .
We mustn't be <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> .
We must prepare it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> adquately </ERR> .
The success is <ERR type=[vp9,3-4]> base </ERR> on the many aspects, including time, hard work, means and so on.
When a child <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> want </ERR> to learn to run, he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sould </ERR> first need time to practise walking.
He is permitted to right <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> means </ERR> to practise running.
So if you want to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suceed </ERR> , you should not <ERR type=[fm3,-][wd2,s-]> Haste </ERR> , because it makes waste.
The <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> most </ERR> waste is the waste of time.
In China, There <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> is </ERR> old story <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> implies </ERR> the statement.
One of them made his <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> knife </ERR> sharper before cutting, so he cut wood quickly and efficiently.
And the other didn't do like that, no <ERR type=[fm2,-]> doubtly </ERR> , he spent much more time than the first one in cutting the wood.
In this story, we can easily conclude that <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Haste </ERR> really makes waste.
When we do something important at uncommon speed, people always tell us "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" is an old-saying that means if we want to complete something successfully, we should do it <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> careful </ERR> rather than do it so fast without any care, or it may waste your time.
[wd7,s-] For <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> instant </ERR> , while a student attends <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> exam, finishing test paper very quickly often results in <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> worse </ERR> marks.
Those all <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> opposites </ERR> to "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> It </ERR> a word, though time is very precious, we should <ERR type=[fm2,-]> well-spend </ERR> it to do important things because of "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
A proverb says "Haste makes waste", which means some people often make things more <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> terrible </ERR> than they expected before because of their haste.
Everything has its own process consisted of many steps, we <ERR type=[fm2,-]> cann't </ERR> leave out some steps which seem to be less important only want to finish it more quickly.
Haste usually <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> bring </ERR> about a failure.
For example, when a teacher modifies <ERR type=[np7,s-]> the </ERR> exam, a student doesn't listen carefully while does his paper, finally he gets the wrong answer only because of his intention of finishing the paper as fast as he can.
In fact, spending such a few minute on teacher's words doesn't affect the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> fulfill </ERR> of the exam.
And in our <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> normal </ERR> life, there are many instances.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> that </ERR> haste makes waste.
We should <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> make </ERR> a full consideration when we prepare to do a thing.
We often say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
If we do a business too <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hastly </ERR> , without considering <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fulling </ERR> , we can not find the best way to do it.
So we say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
For example, when we learn English, we should remember "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
When we are learners, we should learn the simple words <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> firstly </ERR> .
If we cross <ERR type=[cc3,1-3]> over </ERR> the simple words and read the complex texts, we must find great difficulty reading <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> it </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> losed </ERR> interest, then we can't master English forever!
Sometimes, people want to finish works or get <ERR type=[cc3,1-1]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> achievement </ERR> doing a short period, but every problem <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> need </ERR> resolving regularly, and you must do orderly and carefully.
Some people want to hurry, he often doesn't know what to do first and also do a lot of things in a <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> time, </ERR> so, he <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> maybe </ERR> careless and <ERR type=[wd7,-]> subtle </ERR> of what he has done and what is to be done, as a result, come to false .
I remember when I was a high school student of <ERR type=[wd3,5-1]> greet </ERR> two, <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> find </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> test </ERR> was coming but <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> I </ERR> still indulged in playing, I thought, I was clever, and two days before the test was enough to me.
When the "two days" <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> come </ERR> , there were <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> some </ERR> many things to read, I read here a little there a <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> little </ERR> , but remember nothing, so, finally, I didn't pass.
An old saying <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> goes </ERR> that "Haste makes <ERR type=[fm3,2-]> Waste </ERR> ".
It means when you <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> in doing something, you'll probably miss your goal.
If you want to cut across, then you will leave this or that detail that has important effect on the whole thing but you're <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unconcious </ERR> Such <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> omitting </ERR> may lead to your failure.
The following example is just what I experienced <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> now </ERR> .
I'm always afraid of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compisition </ERR> writing, its time limit is so short-30 minutes.
There's no time for drawing a draft, so there're so many <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> corrected </ERR> places in the paper.
As to the example, I have thought for a full ten minute which example is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comherent </ERR> to the subject.
At first I was in a hurry for a quick <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comprisition, </ERR> but now I can only squeeze through it.
Now I've attained a thorough <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comprehesion </ERR> of the saying "Haste makes waste".
The development of a certain thing needs a certain period of time <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> conduct </ERR> the certain procedure.
If we don't proceed <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> along </ERR> the procedure for saving time, the thing will be spoiled.
One old <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> story </ERR> says the following.
If we <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> , the food will possibly come out to be burnt or still raw.
In <ERR type=[pp2,1-1]> one </ERR> word, we must make the best use of time, but not to <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> waste </ERR> .
If you finish your work or study in a hurry, you won't achieve a <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> satisfied </ERR> consequent.
You must have a plan several months, two or three <ERR type=[np3,1-]> day </ERR> , or no more than several seconds, before you decide to accomplish your work.
For example, a man <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> plan </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> product </ERR> a small store of his own.
If he performs his plan in a hurry without consideration, he might be <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> failure </ERR> in a short time.
" But if he goes <ERR type=[cc3,1-1][cc3,1-2]> to </ERR> plan well, he will succeed.
When one wants something to be done more quickly, he tends to <ERR type=[vp5,2-]> using </ERR> less time.
During the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> procession </ERR> he may get lost and <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> performs </ERR> wrong.
<ERR type=[cc2,-4]> Everything </ERR> has its own way to be carried out.
In order to get what we want, we must do it orderly and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paiently </ERR> .
For example in order to win a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chempion </ERR> in a sports meeting, one exercises every day before the meeting.
However, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> some </ERR> day before the meeting he got sick <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> for </ERR> his over <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> done </ERR> .
We must know that <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> Rome isn't <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> established </ERR> in one day.
<ERR type=[np7,-2]> A </ERR> old saying <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> goes </ERR> "More haste, less speed".
When we do many a thing especially more <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> important </ERR> , we try our best to <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> apply </ERR> <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> it </ERR> as fast as possible.
But <ERR type=[cc2,-3]> we </ERR> are so obvious that sometimes we can fail in the end.
A man who <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> achieve </ERR> much success must be patient and takes steps when their causes are under way.
Many people when they work are often easily <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dispointed </ERR> and stop halfway, For example my friend Li Hai is such a man.
Usually he attempts a lot of things, but <ERR type=[ad1,-2]> seldom </ERR> he can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acquint </ERR> the good result.
Many attempts failed, but he held to his purpose with firmness and finally <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> success </ERR> in over <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> throwing </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Qin </ERR> Dynasty.
Thereby when we do something use should take steps and establish a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> schiedule </ERR> primarily and according to the plan go on it.
Otherwise not only <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> can </ERR> we not attain our aims but also we may <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> lost </ERR> our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couragement </ERR> .
We always <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> wish </ERR> finish our tasks quickly.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Sometime </ERR> , <ERR type=[cc2,-4]> something </ERR> wants to be done step by step.
<ERR type=[np6,-s]> Thing </ERR> is done after another things have been finished.
[wd7,s-] Wanting to get <ERR type=[cc3,1-1]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> aim </ERR> , we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sould </ERR> do it step by step.
We wish we are able to write <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conversition </ERR> .
First, we must be able to write words and grasp <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> .
Furthermore, we must read, write and <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> practise </ERR> quantity.
When, these are done, we must <ERR type=[vp9,1-][vp1,-1]> learned </ERR> thinking.
Using our brains, observing things around us, we must <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> to </ERR> be able to write <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conversition </ERR> excellently.
If our words is too poor and our <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> is very <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> mess </ERR> , we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> must </ERR> not write <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conversition </ERR> .
Perhaps it means that when one wants to do something in a hurry, he often fails to do it, at the same time, he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> waste </ERR> his time.
The easiest example may be our study <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> in </ERR> school.
As we sit at the desk, we can't pay attention to the text, or we can't remember what is said in <ERR type=[np6,1-]> page </ERR> at all.
People often say: "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
This word contains several kinds of <ERR type=[np3,2-]> meaning </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> One </ERR> , when you do something hastily, your <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rediation </ERR> isn't full.
When you need something, you can't find and remember <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> them </ERR> .
You will <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> found </ERR> the only <ERR type=[wd7s-s-]> way </ERR> , which is giving it up.
[wd7,s-] Another is that you can't <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> haste </ERR> when you do something.
If you don't act this way, you will make <ERR type=[np6,1-]> mistake </ERR> .
Haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-][fm3,1-1]> Make </ERR> waste.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> solve problems, we should act as this <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> word </ERR> : Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
It means that you <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> want </ERR> do something quickly, but it always <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp1,-5]> make </ERR> you can't do it perfectly, and even make things worse.
" Now, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> First </ERR> , when you <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> are </ERR> hasten, you won't do work <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> careful </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prcisly </ERR> , and you will make more undetected <ERR type=[np3,2-]> mistake </ERR> in <ERR type=[pr4,-1]> you </ERR> work, for example when you are reading a book, if you <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> hurry </ERR> about it, you will overlook many important points, and it is so much <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> so </ERR> that you can't catch on <ERR type=[fm1,-]> immediatly </ERR> then you are wasting time virtually.
Second, the more you want to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> minius </ERR> the time you work the more you must keep up with your <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> think </ERR> , and then you must digest the more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unfamliar </ERR> <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> thing </ERR> , and it will make you confused.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Therefor </ERR> when <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> you </ERR> do a thing better you shouldn't <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> "haste" </ERR> and then you will probably do it successfully.
"Haste makes waste" is <ERR type=[np7,s-]> the </ERR> famous saying.
<ERR type=[wd3,-3]> It </ERR> is to say, the more you <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> will </ERR> want, the less you will get.
When you do something, if you are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasted </ERR> , you can't do it carefully, there <ERR type=[vp3,1-s]> are </ERR> much detail you will omit and there are <ERR type=[np8,-1]> much </ERR> errors you will make.
When the thing is finished, the end is worse than you <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> want </ERR> .
[wd7,s-]
There are many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> example </ERR> .
As far as <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> study </ERR> English is concerned, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> is a case in point.
It is well <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> known, </ERR> the English study is a slow course.
To <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> the new words, you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shold </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-][cc5,-4]> remeber </ERR> it again and again, and you should <ERR type=[fm1,-]> remeber </ERR> the words not too much you want to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> news </ERR> words a hundred one <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> day, </ERR> tomorrow you will forget 99 of them.
Let us <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> the saying "Haste makes waste", to do every thing carefully and slowly.
It means one always can't <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> realize </ERR> his purpose if he does <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> in a hurry.
Why <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> does </ERR> it so?
There are some <ERR type=[np3,2-]> reason </ERR> .
When one <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to finish something quickly he tends to do it in a hurry.
He can't consider all the aspects of it and it probably <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> draw </ERR> back the <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> proceeding </ERR> .
Another is that one in a hurry can't do well and, it maybe <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> postpone </ERR> the achievements.
There is an example that can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> vertify </ERR> the truth of "Haste makes waste" well.
A person wants to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> meet </ERR> the train as quickly as he can.
He <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hurrys </ERR> out and gets to the station 15 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> miniturs </ERR> earlier.
Suddenly he finds he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> forget </ERR> to take the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suicase </ERR> that he must use.
Doesn't it tell us that he didn't do <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> ?
For example, if you are doing your homework, Mother <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> told </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> you </ERR> should finish your homework, and then you <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> should </ERR> go to play with your friends.
I should <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> haven't </ERR> made these mistakes.
People can't do anything perfectly in <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> eagerness </ERR> even in anxiety.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Psyologists </ERR> also suggest eagerness <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> don't </ERR> mean good <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> lucky </ERR> .
Because we can do everything better without the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> psyological </ERR> pressure.
In the history of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> socience </ERR> , many famous scientists discovered or invented scientific equation or something <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> use </ERR> .
Haste makes waste, calmness makes <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> use </ERR> .
You know the things <ERR type=[fm1,-]> devolop </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> graduatedly </ERR> .
Haste can let the things run <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> away </ERR> the usual route.
Not only can't obtain the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gaol </ERR> .
But also bring the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opposit </ERR> effect sometimes.
We can't change the normal rule of the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> nature, </ERR> can't do our works <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unconsidering </ERR> the fact.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> only </ERR> can you succeed obeying the natural's development <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> regular </ERR> .
We can say haste makes waste the following is some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> exampls </ERR> .
As a <ERR type=[np3,-s]> student </ERR> , we all have the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> experiment </ERR> that, we study the lesson must have the spirit of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> graduatedly </ERR> , some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> student </ERR> have not the firm <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> basement </ERR> .
But they want to study the course beyond <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> level, as a result, <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> geting </ERR> can't <ERR type=[vp7,-1]> compare </ERR> with <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> his </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> lost </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Another </ERR> , when we exercise our body <ERR type=[fm1,-]> farthermore </ERR> , we must obey the rule.
It <ERR type=[ad1,-2]> often </ERR> can be seen that someone is too eager to do things <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> ahead </ERR> , but they fail in the end.
There are some <ERR type=[np3,2-]> reason </ERR> .
Above <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> all </ERR> is that most of them haven't prepared well for their work.
Then when they meet some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> problem </ERR> , they don't know how to do.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> The </ERR> third, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Most </ERR> of the works need great <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> patient </ERR> .
If you want to <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> haste </ERR> , the chance of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> succeed </ERR> will go.
So <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> from </ERR> above, we can see that haste makes waste.
To the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> peasents </ERR> , haste may be bad for their harvest.
As for workers, if they <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> proceed </ERR> the production too fast, the <ERR type=[wd2,-3]> production </ERR> with bad quality would come out.
As students, we should <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> haste </ERR> in our study.
So we mustn't <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> haste </ERR> when we do anything.
But it is not equal to that we can slow down our speed because of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> lazy </ERR> or other reasons.
We need to do well <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> prepare </ERR> and want <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> for </ERR> the chance.
When the chance comes, we shall work with <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> patient </ERR> .
The Chinese idiom, haste makes waste, means that the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> willing </ERR> to save time often results in a waste of time.
It <ERR type=[fm1,-]> orginates </ERR> from an old story.
Firstly he <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rided </ERR> a horse and kept <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spuring </ERR> it in order to <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> get </ERR> earlier.
But he was so anxious that he thought the horse run too <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> slow </ERR> .
Then he jumped down from the horse <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> back </ERR> and walked on foot.
From this story we know: <ERR type=[fm1,-]> uder </ERR> some emergent circumstances in order to save time we easily become anxious and lose our <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sensiability </ERR> , we forget so many <ERR type=[np3,2-]> convention </ERR> that we can't <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> give </ERR> a right decision.
Haste makes us anxious and <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> anxious </ERR> makes us <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unsensitible </ERR> which leads to a waste in the end.
We must keep a calm <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> head </ERR> under any circumstance.
Please <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rember </ERR> "Haste makes waste".
As we <ERR type=[vp4,2-]> known </ERR> , hurry comes along with haste.
[wd7,s-] When you want to finish a thing as quickly as possible, you have little time to think <ERR type=[vp1,1-3]> over </ERR> how to do it <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> efficiently, </ERR> how to make full use of materials.
What's more, haste makes you nervous, then all the things <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> will </ERR> in a mess and you can hardly decide how to go on.
In conclusion, we must know: Firstly, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> haster </ERR> makes waste of money and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> meterials </ERR> .
Second, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> haster </ERR> wastes your time, maybe you have to start again in a hurry.
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Haster </ERR> always <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> block </ERR> you up.
The <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> waster </ERR> made by <ERR type=[fm2,-]> haster </ERR> is easy to see.
I can <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> make </ERR> some examples from myself.
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> try </ERR> my best to work as quickly as possible as to cut all its parts out from the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> template </ERR> , then they are lying in front of me in a mess and I really do not know which one should I pick up firstly and how to begin!
I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> waste </ERR> all my <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> time </ERR> the day!
It's <ERR type=[fm2,-]> quitely </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> confirm </ERR> the old saying: "Haste makes waste.
Sometimes, we are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benifited </ERR> by it, but most of <ERR type=[np5,s-]> times </ERR> , we fail and have to waste more time to start from the beginning again.
So what we can do is just to follow the <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> order </ERR> .
As we all <ERR type=[np3,3-]> knows </ERR> , a man will be hurt on <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> his </ERR> mouth if he is too eager to <ERR type=[vp5,3-]> drinking </ERR> the boiling water.
How <ERR type=[vp3,-1]> does </ERR> we obey this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> priciple </ERR> ?
In our ordinary lives, we must grasp some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scient </ERR> <ERR type=[np5,-]> knowledges </ERR> and then use them.
However, we <ERR type=[vp9,-2]> must </ERR> to work to make our lives more <ERR type=[fm2,-]> facilited </ERR> with more efficient way.
In this case, he does everything <ERR type=[fm2,-]> discarefully </ERR> , so that he would lose this or forget that.
It is Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
But, <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> is the simple meaning, there is still further meaning in our lives.
You may get it <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> in </ERR> my following example.
They each wanted to get out as <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> quick </ERR> as possible, and no one wanted to die.
So many people <ERR type=[vp6,-s-]> get </ERR> to the gate at the same time that they were <ERR type=[fm2,-]> stucked </ERR> in it and no one got out.
But <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> suppose, </ERR> one person stand out to make order.
Everyone <ERR type=[fm2,-]> standed </ERR> in line, may-be no one <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> would </ERR> die.
I think, <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> it </ERR> important for us to keep calm in <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> this </ERR> case.
This <ERR type=[np3,1-]> words </ERR> indicates that if you want to do something in a hurry, finish it earlier than before, you will get nothing at last.
For example, when I was <ERR type=[aj5,3-]> 15-year-old </ERR> , I was fond of football.
At <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> a </ERR> time, several friends asked me to play football when I was helping my mother to <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> have </ERR> a cooking.
In order to play football as soon as I can, I hurried to wear my shoe and let the fire <ERR type=[vp5,3-][cc5,-1]> burning </ERR> larger.
But some minutes later, <ERR type=[cc2,-4]> I </ERR> smelt of <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> nasty </ERR> gas.
So as you can see, when we do anything, we should do it slowly, not <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hurrily </ERR> .
Otherwise we could not get the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> consequence </ERR> that we expect.
So why we <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> don't </ERR> do it at leisure?
Haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> waste, because you haven't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prepaired </ERR> everything you must have done.
<ERR type=[wd7,s-s-]]> It's </ERR> the foundation.
When we start to do something, firstly we should do <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> something </ERR> : make a good plan, find something we need to use, and some people if we can't do it without their help, and so on.
When all is <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> running </ERR> , we just do it.
<ERR type=[np7,-1]> A </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> excession </ERR> is needed.
[wd7,s-] But there are many difficulties.
For example, a girl is fat and she <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> want </ERR> to be thinner and more beautiful.
<ERR type=[wd2,s-]> Haste </ERR> ?
She may <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> get </ERR> on diet or even eat nothing except water.
[wd7,s-] Otherwise it will be out of order.
At the same time she <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> need </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phsical </ERR> training.
In <ERR type=[pp2,-]> all </ERR> , haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> waste.
Walking on the <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> ground, </ERR> we'll reach the success.
It is true that <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Haste </ERR> makes waste.
They try their best but get zero in <ERR type=[np6,1-]> test </ERR> .
In society, we can see the people who are eager to find a <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> cut-cross </ERR> to great wealth in spite of the precept of "no pay, no <ERR type=[np2,3-]> gains </ERR> ".
Such people <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> so dangerous that they can finally commit any crime to attain their goal.
Here we see the fact that <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Haste </ERR> not only makes waste but also makes <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disasterous </ERR> damages to society.
It only <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp1,-2]> lead </ERR> to fall.
When we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> devolop </ERR> our country, we shall do it step by step.
There's a <ERR type=[np1,s-]> lesson </ERR> in <ERR type=[np6,1-]> history </ERR> that we tried to be too fast to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> devolop </ERR> our society.
Whenever and <ERR type=[wd4,-s-]> wherever </ERR> we shall remember <ERR type=[pr2,-s-]> it </ERR> : haste makes waste.
Because anything has its <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> style </ERR> , once we break the style, we will can't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succees </ERR> .
When we read <ERR type=[np6,1-]> book </ERR> , we want to learn more and more information,but there is a limit in our mind, the information <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp1,-3]> reach </ERR> to the limit, our mind will <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> can't </ERR> receive new information.
If you force <ERR type=[fm1,-]> youself </ERR> to receive new information again, you will make all of the <ERR type=[cc2,1-2]> information </ERR> give off from your mind.
[wd7,s-]
Long, long ago, a man <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> want </ERR> to make a tree grow more <ERR type=[ad3,1-]> fast </ERR> , he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> drow </ERR> the tree to help <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> , but the tree "dies" .
Because he didn't know the tree <ERR type=[fm2,-]> growed </ERR> according to its <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> style </ERR> , he couldn't help it, at last he made the tree "die".
<ERR type=[wd7,-s-]> At </ERR> every doing <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> live </ERR> , there are a lot of <ERR type=[np3,3-]> example </ERR> , haste makes waste, we must warn of it.
After it is created, it develops step by step, and then <ERR type=[fm1,-]> reachs </ERR> the end.
Maybe, we make a good beginning, but we also <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> think </ERR> "be quick, be quick", so we became hasty and impatient, we forget the steps, we want to swallow an elephant at one time.
Thus we are doomed to <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> be </ERR> fail.
Father always tells me,"Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
A hasty <ERR type=[np3,2-]> men </ERR> wanted his crop grow <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> sooner </ERR> , so he pulled them up.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Now </ERR> , it seemed that the crop grew much taller, but the next day, they all died.
Chinese people usually say, "Hasty man can not eat up a hot <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beancurd </ERR> .
Haste makes <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Waste </ERR> .
That is to say: Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
Emphasizing <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> anyone </ERR> and ignoring the other will be haste makes waste.
"Haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> make </ERR> waste" <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> tell </ERR> us how to deal <ERR type=[cc3,1-6]> with </ERR> the situation and our wills.
Only when what we are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thing </ERR> about met the situation's <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> quest </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Our </ERR> wish <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> can </ERR> come into true.
If we disobey the regulation, we'll never <ERR type=[fm1,-]> succees </ERR> .
That's <ERR type=[fm3,-]> "Haste </ERR> makes waste".
For example, when we learn English, all of us want <ERR type=[vp4,1-]> make </ERR> a <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> quick </ERR> .
But <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> sometime </ERR> , we learn a lot as much as other people <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> learn, </ERR> it's ineffective.
Because it is the case in overwhelming <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> majority </ERR> situations.
With the development of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mordern </ERR> society, the tempo of our life become quicker and quicker, so we pay much attention to speed.
Even at times haste <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> make </ERR> waste.
For example, this idiom is very <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> fitted </ERR> for our study.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> otherwise </ERR> , we can't reach the rich storehouse of the knowledge.
Beside <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> forgoing </ERR> , it can also be <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> fitted </ERR> for most of the aspects of our daily life.
Since <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> then, </ERR> we must make sense of the idiom "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" and <ERR type=[wd3,-4]> bring </ERR> it in our minds when we do something, especially important things.
Only by this, we <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> can </ERR> reach our purposes successfully.
What "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" means is that we won't succeed in <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> anything </ERR> we want to finish it too quickly.
The reason is that when we try to finish something too quickly, <ERR type=[ad1,-2]> always </ERR> we will not make the preparations which are necessarily needed, or not do it step by step, just to save the time.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> And </ERR> obviously the preparations and doing it step by step is all those that will lead to the success.
If we want to <ERR type=[fm1,-3][cc3,-]> develope </ERR> our English degree, we can not hope to succeed in a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shorp </ERR> period of time.
Because to <ERR type=[fm1,-][cc3,-2]> develope </ERR> English degree is to have a large number of work for us to do.
We must <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> add </ERR> our vocabulary; we must do reading excises to improve our reading skill; we must make clear <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> of </ERR> all kinds of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gramme </ERR> .
It's easy to see that if we want to finish these in a short time, however hard we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> worked </ERR> , it would still be impossible for us to turn our <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> will </ERR> into fact.
Chinese has <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> old saying: Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
Because people think that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> whateven </ERR> we want to do, we must prepare it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> consvertinely </ERR> .
We might as well complete it by acting on its <ERR type=[fm1,-]> princepel </ERR> .
If we work without considering everything that we <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> must </ERR> aware of we probably will come to falling <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> down </ERR> .
[wd7,s-]
We <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wanna </ERR> complete it very soon, so we prepare the food very simply and cook them very <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hastely </ERR> .
We will most probably forget to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> drep </ERR> something else which must <ERR type=[vp7,4-]> add </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> up </ERR> to the food.
And we will probably cut short the time that we're <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> cooking </ERR> .
So, we must <ERR type=[fm1,-]> remmber </ERR> : Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste, We <ERR type=[vp2,-3]> have </ERR> better do everything by acting on its <ERR type=[fm1,-]> princepel </ERR> .
It is well known for <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> us </ERR> that "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
Sometimes we want to get to someplace on time in a limited time, we are so <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> hurry </ERR> and anxious <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> that </ERR> forget to bring some important things with us.
When we <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> get </ERR> the destination we just find that we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> forget </ERR> to bring the things we need.
For instance, you hurried into the classroom to attend an important exam, Perhaps you feel lucky that you use the shortest time from home or dormitory to the classroom <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> and </ERR> just before the exam begin.
But suddenly you find you forgot to bring your permission of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> examnation </ERR> .
Sometimes we want to get high score in the final exam and before the exam we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> worked </ERR> very hard without thinking of our <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> healthy </ERR> .
When the date of exam <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> come </ERR> , we are so tired that we have no <ERR type=[fm1,-]> spirt </ERR> to do the problems.
<ERR type=[wd3,-1]> Even </ERR> worse, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> sometime </ERR> we fail to attend the exam because we are ill caused by <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> tired </ERR> .
We never forget that in our recent history there was Great <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> Promotion </ERR> .
Perhaps the thought of <ERR type=[vp4,1-1]> progress </ERR> quickly is good, but we also should think about the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envirenment </ERR> and capability, as well as other elements.
If we only seek the goal <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> while </ERR> ignore the <ERR type=[ad2,-1]> very </ERR> elements in process, we just put ourselves into such <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> result </ERR> -- Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
Sometimes we say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
Haste means acting quickly and waste means <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> having </ERR> no good, uselessness.
So how to comprehensive "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste"?
It just tells us that whatever we do, we should comply with the inherent principles of the matter and not go beyond even break the rules, or you will get nothing but the waste of time, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> metiral </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> or </ERR> etc.
For instance, a certain man <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> want </ERR> to buy a pair of shoes, some books and he also wants to repair his bike and then he want <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> go fishing.
If he does arrange them in order, first to buy the book, then goes along <ERR type=[np6,1-]> street </ERR> to buy the shoes, then returns home for the fishing tools and the goes out for finishing, how could <ERR type=[fm1,s-]> be </ERR> manage all the three things together?
He will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> undoutably </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> does </ERR> nothing <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> that </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> but </ERR> busy going here and there.
Haste <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste is a Chinese old saying.
First, if you are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasteful </ERR> to do something, you can't think it over and over.
Second, during the course of doing everything you might lose patience if you are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasteful </ERR> .
Finally, everything has its own <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rythmn </ERR> of development.
If you are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasteful </ERR> you'll break its <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rythmn </ERR> and make waste.
For example, in ancient China there was a peasant who <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> owed </ERR> a piece of field.
He was so <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hasteful </ERR> that he wanted his crops to grow quickly, so one day he went to the field and pulled all of his crops to make them <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> seen </ERR> taller.
From this example we can see "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" this <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> old saying .
Many people haven't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paient </ERR> , they want to succeed <ERR type=[fm1,-]> immeditaly </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Wehether </ERR> we work or study, we must have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paient </ERR> .
Because, above all, we have to prepare everything well before we start, we must study it carefully, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> schelude </ERR> the process, and then, do it step by step.
[wd7,s-]
One year before I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dicided </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> attend </ERR> English corner, to improve my English level.
I thought that only if I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> attend </ERR> , I would have what I wanted.
But in fact, I couldn't <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> hear </ERR> and say anything in the corner.
As a result, I wasted much time <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> in </ERR> English corner, but gained nothing.
He <ERR type=[wd2,1-][vp1,-2]> adviced </ERR> me prepare before going <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> English corner, speak and listen more in everyday life, improve English level little by little.
And now, I can speak and listen freely <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> in </ERR> English corner.
If you want to succeed, "step by step" is the best way you should <ERR type=[cc3,s-]> obey </ERR> .
People often say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste!
There are several <ERR type=[np3,2-]> reason </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> on </ERR> it.
First, when one wants to do something quickly, he can't think it over and <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> arrange </ERR> how to do it well.
So when he does it, he doesn't know what's the best means and how to do it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> effectiently </ERR> .
As a result, the faster he wants to do something, the <ERR type=[ad3,s-]> worst </ERR> the result is.
For <ERR type=[fm1,-]> instaince </ERR> , my uncle is a man who likes to do anything quickly.
One <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> time </ERR> , he wanted to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chang </ERR> the windows' glass in his house.
But he didn't accept the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> advise </ERR> .
Once he wanted to let a bottle of beer cool quickly so he put it into the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> refertior </ERR> .
After several minutes, the bottle broke and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> refert </ERR> ... was useless too.
In a word, we do something we must think it over and do it <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> careful </ERR> .
So he or she often <ERR type=[vp3,-3]> take </ERR> some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> methords </ERR> or measures without thinking carefully and completely.
As a result, they don't realize their object or gain what they want to have, <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> even </ERR> go to the opposite direction.
For example, when we are studying at school, we want to gain a best score <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> at </ERR> test, so we often <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> think </ERR> some quick way to receive it.
Sometimes we will find some books, which we think <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> of </ERR> are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> avaibbe </ERR> to the tests, and read them more and <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> more </ERR> carefully to hope we will guess the key of the questions <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> on </ERR> the test, and give up the basic knowledge which the teacher teaches us every day.
But at last we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fall </ERR> because we are too <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> haste </ERR> to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sucess </ERR> .
To <ERR type=[fm1,-]> avoide </ERR> the shortcoming, we should try our best to make our doing more <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> efficient </ERR> .
Here is an example, if we want to <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> get </ERR> some place in an unfamiliar city, what should we do first?
On the other hand, in our daily life, we should do everything from the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> start </ERR> point, and do it step by step.
When we want to do something, good <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prepairation </ERR> is necessary.
What you have done is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> meaningles </ERR> .
So, it is wise to sharpen your <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> knife </ERR> first, then use it to cut the wood.
It means people sometimes <ERR type=[fm1,-]> disire </ERR> to do <ERR type=[np6,s-]> thing </ERR> quickly but finally find that it takes much more time <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> than </ERR> expected.
I think there are main reasons <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> as </ERR> following: Firstly, when people want to finish their work as soon as they can, they always ignore some details of the work.
When they start working, what <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> not expected happens, and they will not be able to solve the problem smoothly.
You do not eat your <ERR type=[fm1,-]> breakfirst </ERR> at table but take it to your car.
We all say "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> but </ERR> why?
But we must remember, whatever we do, we must <ERR type=[vp1,2-3]> do </ERR> step by step.
If you don't lay a good basis and <ERR type=[vp1,s-3]> do </ERR> step by step, you won't <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> aim </ERR> your goal.
So if you only want to be <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> haste </ERR> in your work, you will fail in the end.
So we say "Haste Makes <ERR type=[fm3,2-]> Waste </ERR> ".
<ERR type=[wd4,-2]> Take </ERR> for example.
It will take you years before you are <ERR type=[aj1,-1]> good </ERR> it.
You must remember "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste" in study.
When we do things, we should take it in <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> sequence </ERR> .
Why do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> peploe </ERR> say that haste makes waste?
First, when we are in haste, we can't keep <ERR type=[fm1,-]> clam </ERR> and think carefully.
Second, everything has its own <ERR type=[wd7,4-]> turn </ERR> , we can not change it.
We can understand the saying from many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> relastic </ERR> examples.
If you want to make yourself <ERR type=[wd2,2]> strength </ERR> , you should do exercises often, have rest and eat well.
The importance of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> is that you should keep <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> constantly.
<ERR type=[vp4,s-]> Educate </ERR> a person is the same principle.
The change of a person's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> though </ERR> has a process.
In <ERR type=[pp2,1-1]> one </ERR> word, we should take things <ERR type=[pp2,-1]> at </ERR> turn.
We think we could have time <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> enough </ERR> .
And when we correct the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> wrong </ERR> , we spend more time on it than we do the thing a <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> time </ERR> .
One morning, when we <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> would </ERR> exam, I got up early and had breakfast quickly because I wanted to go to school earlier.
When I <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> hurried </ERR> out home, my mother told me to look through my bag and see <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> whether </ERR> left something.
But I hurried <ERR type=[ad2,2-]> out </ERR> and didn't do it.
Taking the pencil I hurried <ERR type=[ad2,2-]> out </ERR> again.
After I <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> want </ERR> home and told <ERR type=[np6,1-]> mother </ERR> the thing, <ERR type=[np6,1-]> mother </ERR> said haste makes waste.
It <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> seems </ERR> a very simple question.
To finish it in a short time, we have no time to examine the procedure, so <ERR type=[ad1,-2]> always </ERR> we <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> fall </ERR> .
Here is an example about "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> The </ERR> are very eager to find a way that they can master this language quickly.
They may do a lot of exercises in one <ERR type=[fm1,-]> perial </ERR> .
And when they have lost <ERR type=[fm1,-]> insterst </ERR> in studying English <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> push it aside.
When they are <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> asked </ERR> , they will say that it is difficult to study English.
But, they should know, anybody who <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> learn </ERR> English well depends on a kind of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> permenant </ERR> spirit.
And it is the reason that finally <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> lead </ERR> to their success.
So if you want to master a language, you should never make <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> this </ERR> mistake: Haste <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Maskes </ERR> Waste.
This example embodies the saying, Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
I think you will answer the question <ERR type=[pp2,-3]> on </ERR> the head of the article.
[wd7,s-] It's known to all that we can not count the chickens <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> before </ERR> hatched.
Some <ERR type=[np3,1-]> person </ERR> have not realized this theory.
They <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> hurried </ERR> in doing something in order to finish it as early as possible, without <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> preparing </ERR> with the basic <ERR type=[fm1,-]> requestions </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,-1]> Even </ERR> worse, it will be made in a mess.
Say , that is "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
For <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> an </ERR> example, when you were driving a car, you drove it so fast that you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> can </ERR> get home quickly.
There's a <ERR type=[fm2,1-][np3,1-]> traffic-lights </ERR> ahead.
Surely, you could drive the car across the crossing without stopping <ERR type=[fm1,-]> through </ERR> the light was red.
Then the police would stop you, or sometimes you would catch an accident <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unluckly </ERR> .
If every driver has the same opinion <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> with </ERR> yours, the city must be out of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> controll </ERR> .
So "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste".
Don't be aimless, you should do it step by step while you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> were </ERR> doing something.
Haste makes waste is <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acient </ERR> idiom.
It is <ERR type=[np6,s-]> summary </ERR> of people's long experience.
Everything has its <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> specially </ERR> characteristic, according <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> to </ERR> it, you would get benefits from it, but if you <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> exceed </ERR> it, it would get badly to <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> you </ERR> , it would keep back your <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> processor </ERR> , so said haste makes waste .
Such <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> as </ERR> , when you have a chemistry <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> experience </ERR> , you should heat the tube slowly, if you heat the tube quickly, the tube's temperature raise quickly, it would crash, so you have to try another tube, so you finish the <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> experience </ERR> slowly.
We should learn to <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> not </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> haste </ERR> , not to waste <ERR type=[pr4,1-1]> us </ERR> time.
Haste makes waste means we do things in a hurry for saving time, but in the end the result is not so <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> satisfied </ERR> .
Because when we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> finished </ERR> a job in a hurry <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> we </ERR> often not so careful, not so accurate.
Therefore, we may easily do some thing <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> wrong </ERR> with <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> it </ERR> .
So we have to do it again or to do some <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> repair </ERR> work.
This idiom is widely <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> uses </ERR> in many aspects.
Usually it is used to tell someone to do things carefully don't think too much of the time, to do it well is better <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> than </ERR> do it again.
I have an example for this <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> thing </ERR> .
One day I wanted to get a good place in the classroom, because that night's lecture <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> is </ERR> very interesting, and the classroom is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> harshed </ERR> .
So I picked up all the necessaries of the class and without <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> checking </ERR> up.
When I quickly passed the campus and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> finially </ERR> got a good seat I was very <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> please </ERR> about it.
But as soon as the teacher <ERR type=[fm1,-]> beggan </ERR> to speak, I suddenly found out that the text book was <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> left </ERR> .
So the whole night, I <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> have </ERR> to share the book with another classmate, and it really disturbed her, I <ERR type=[fm2,-]> feeled </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> regret </ERR> but I have no choice.
There is a story about Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
Long long <ERR type=[fm1,-]> age </ERR> , a man wanted to go to the county, but the county door would be closed soon, and he <ERR type=[vp6,s-][vp3,1-]> have </ERR> many books banded with <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rop </ERR> .
So he <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> ask </ERR> a man <ERR type=[wd3,2-2]> in </ERR> the way "Can I go into the county today?
" The man <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> look </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> up </ERR> him and said 'If you walk slowly, you can.
' The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> travier </ERR> was very happy, and he wanted to go into the county <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fastly </ERR> , so he walked <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fastly </ERR> .
But near the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> door </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rop </ERR> broke, and the man had to stop to <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> do </ERR> with his books, when he finished <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> doing </ERR> with books, he found the door had <ERR type=[vp9,1-1]> be </ERR> closed.
This <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> mean </ERR> that if we want to do something, we shall do <ERR type=[fm1,-]> it </ERR> turn, if we want to do it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fastly </ERR> and not in turn then will haste makes waste .
For example, some drivers wanted to go home early, so they drove <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fastly </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> speeching </ERR> then <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> accident happened, the drivers were injured, so they could not go home early, but <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> waste </ERR> <ERR type=[np8,-1]> many </ERR> time in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hosplts </ERR> or he never <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> come </ERR> home again.
Why <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> is </ERR> the case?
Most things we do in our daily life <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> proves </ERR> the saying right.
But without a well organized <ERR type=[fm2,-]> constructure </ERR> , the students especially beginners aren't able to write a precise, coherent composition.
So remember "Haste <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> Makes </ERR> Waste.
With the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> developing </ERR> of the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> economic </ERR> , the social <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> commodities </ERR> become richer and <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> richer, </ERR> but, at the same time, some person and <ERR type=[np3,3-]> factory </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> made </ERR> fake commodities in order to obtain much money .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> these </ERR> fake commodities bring much trouble to thousands and millions of people.
For example: fake medicine, if a patient <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> uses </ERR> the fake medicine, he is not being healthy in time, however, he maybe <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> been done harm by this medicine .
If you want to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> built </ERR> a big building, the fake material will make the building dangerous to <ERR type=[fm2,-]> mans' </ERR> life.
How can we prevent these <ERR type=[np3,1-]> thing </ERR> from taking place?
I think, at first the factory which <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> produce </ERR> the good <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> commodities </ERR> should actively <ERR type=[cc3,-4]> protect </ERR> the advantage of themselves, then we can call on all the <ERR type=[np3,2-]> person </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> object </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> use </ERR> the fake commodities, the <ERR type=[wd6,1-]> the </ERR> fake commodities can not occupy the market .
On the other hand we should educate the people and let them know the behavior that <ERR type=[vp3,3-][vp1,1-4]> make </ERR> fake commodities does not <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> permit </ERR> by the law.
At last, we should take advantage of the <ERR type=[cc3,4-]> law </ERR> .
The life of people is seriously <ERR type=[cc2,5-]> affected </ERR> .
For example, someone sold wines made <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> from </ERR> <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> industrious </ERR> alcohol, and it caused many people to be blind, even to be dead.
Furthermore, fake commodities affect the <ERR type=[wd2,-]> flourish </ERR> of the economy.
Many factories that produce <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> good </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> commodites </ERR> are at a disadvantage because of their high price.
Firstly we should establish a <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> good </ERR> system of law.
Secondly, as a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> citzen </ERR> of the country, we shouldn't buy fake <ERR type=[fm1,-]> commdites </ERR> .
Fake commodities may be cheaper than <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> good </ERR> commodities but their quality is very poor.
I think, if we all don't buy fake commodities, then <ERR type=[wd5,-]> in </ERR> some day, fake commodities will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diappear </ERR> in the market.

Someone produce fake commodities in order to gain huge <ERR type=[wd3,-]> money </ERR> , so the commodities only <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> looks </ERR> like <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> really </ERR> things, they are often useless or don't last .
Secondly, some <ERR type=[np6,1-3]> kind </ERR> of fake commodities do harm to people.
For example, fake wine always makes <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> person </ERR> <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> blind </ERR> who has drunk <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> them </ERR> too much because the alcohol which was used to produce fake wine <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acturally </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,-]> must </ERR> be used in industry only.
So we must prevent fake commodities from <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> producing </ERR> and being sold .

On the other hand, we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> customors </ERR> also should train the ability to find <ERR type=[wd3,-]> out </ERR> fake commodities when shopping.I think the fake commodities can be prevented depending on the strength of law and the work <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> of </ERR> government and <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> popular </ERR> .

There are full of commodities in the market, all kinds and all <ERR type=[np6,1-]> type </ERR> .
But there are also full of fake commodities in the market, all kinds and all <ERR type=[np6,-]> type </ERR> as the truth.
Because some persons want to "get" more money, they can buy or "make" something <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> with </ERR> poor quality and pack them with a well-known factory's or company's <ERR type=[wd3,-]> name </ERR> and put them into market---- It's fake commodity .

You can think people buy the fake commodities, find <ERR type=[fm2,-3]> it's </ERR> quality is poor, then they will not buy that kind of commodity at all .

First, I think, every consumer must <ERR type=[fm2,-]> highen </ERR> their vigilance when <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> they </ERR> go shopping, we should never do business with those "small" sellers on the street.

Therefore, it is essentially important for college students to know the world outside the campus.There are several ways for college <ERR type=[np6,2-]> student </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> do </ERR> so.

Behind ShiZuiXian, there are green fields <ERR type=[fm1,-]> while </ERR> make people feel comfortable, while behind YuBei, there is a stinking ditch which makes <ERR type=[fm1,-]> on </ERR> lose appetite at once.
It is very quiet in Shi Zhi Xian,nevertheless <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It </ERR> is very noisy in Yun Bei.
As She <ERR type=[fm3,-]> xui </ERR> Xian is much farther to the highway than Yun Bei, the air in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> shixui </ERR> Xian is much <ERR type=[fm2,-]> cleanner </ERR> and clearer than that of Yun Bei.
CECL is a <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> now </ERR> approach developed by GIFL for Chinese learners of English to develop their communication ability.
This class usually consists of listening, reading, talking, writing activities, So you need to get your textbook, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> vacaburary </ERR> list, earphone, pen and of course, your partner ready before attending your class.
First of all, you should preview the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> vocaburary </ERR> list because there's no time for you to learn the new words in class.

Then <ERR type=[fm1,-]> omes </ERR> the reading activity, which is usually some fast-reading materials, Again, <ERR type=[wd3,-8]> year </ERR> will have to do a lot of exercises, such as summary of a text, gap-filling, comprehensive questions.
When a person has too much of something, he will certainly have the feeling of boredom, no matter how interesting the thing he first feel is, when there is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> othing </ERR> for one to do, this same feeling will certainly come up.
For a student, this feeling appears <ERR type=[ad1,3-]> always </ERR> when <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,2-2][wd3,-2]> hurrying </ERR> the homework; for a husband, this feeling appears <ERR type=[ad1,3-]> always </ERR> when his wife prepares the same dish for him, or wears the same pajamas, for a lover, maybe when he or she always receives flowers from the same person .
Actually, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> No </ERR> one in this world that doesn't have boredom .
However every <ERR type=[fm2,-]> day </ERR> everyone is creating new boredom if he <ERR type=[fm1,-]> his </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> succeeded </ERR> to abandon the old-which is not often the case.
Boredom results from all kinds of things, from doing homework, from travelling on business, from <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> greeting </ERR> to people, or even from drinking beer--which is longed for by most of people.
Boredom is something of great <ERR type=[fm1,-]> varities </ERR> , which no ne an escape from.

All that seemed <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> like </ERR> very delicious.
And then three small bowls <ERR type=[wd5,3-3]> with </ERR> full of rice were placed around the plates and the soup bowl.
Each bowl was <ERR type=[vp7,3-5]> occupied </ERR> one third of the table area and near the table --edge.

May <ERR type=[fm2,-]> be </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> They </ERR> have walked a long way and came here to find their mother.
So his wife left home and went to her <ERR type=[fm1,-]> count's </ERR> family on impulse.
In the morning I usually get up at 6: 30 .The <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> broadcast </ERR> station of our campus wakes me up every morning.
Then I get dressed from the cloth <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> hanger </ERR> .
When the water is boiling, <ERR type=[,-s]> adding </ERR> two spoons of milk powder into the water and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> stiring </ERR> it, and then put three or four <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> square </ERR> sugar.
As soon as the milk is boiling, I <ERR type=[vp4,-s]> breaking </ERR> an egg into the milk and mix it together.
Wait <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> are </ERR> minute, it is ready to have.
I have milk and <ERR type=[np6,4-]> biscuit </ERR> for my breakfast.
After I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> finished </ERR> my breakfast at 7:00 .I begin to listen to the radio--VOA, but sometimes I can't get the clear signal, so I listen to the China Radio now and then.

One monthly <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> paid </ERR> was equal to one year's in her hometown.
Lifang was attracted by his <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sweat </ERR> words and trusted him.
She followed the young man to <ERR type=[wd5,0-1]> come </ERR> to Guangzhou one month <ERR type=[wd2,-]> past </ERR> , the young man did not find a job for her.
Li <ERR type=[fm3,-]> fang </ERR> began to feel anxious because she almost ran out of her money.
The <ERR type=[wd2,1-5]> paid </ERR> would be one thousand yuan per month, and she could also have a room which was given by the boss.
A sixty year old man entered <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> into </ERR> the room.
He looked sinister with his belly <ERR type=[vp5,6-1]> stuck </ERR> out.
So <ERR type=[cj1,-s]> that </ERR> , all her happiness was ruined poorly.
After I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> leant </ERR> that, the idea which was to be a secretary in the future was given up.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Athough </ERR> not all are the same case, I know I have to choose my job carefully.
Mrs Landlord: I am sorry to bother you, but I can not stand the noise <ERR type=[vp1,3-3]> come </ERR> from <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> upstair, since they moved in, I never have a good time.
If the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> noisy </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> continue </ERR> .
In the morning, when the sky still is dark, they begin to do morning <ERR type=[np6,2-]> exercise </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> In </ERR> the room, running, jumping and even singing.
<ERR type=[np3,-1]> Sounds </ERR> is very disgusting.
I'm afraid that <ERR type=[pr4,-]> them </ERR> floor will fall down <ERR type=[wd7,5-]> one </ERR> .
I look at the clock, oh, my <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> godness </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-][wd4,-s]> It </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> a </ERR> only five.
In the evening, I usually do my homework till 10.Every time, when I am thinking about something, I <ERR type=[ad1,-s]> always </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,2-4]> be </ERR> disturbed by sharp shouting, chatting or laughing.
And <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> they </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> voice </ERR> of the TV set can be heard a mile away.
So I can not concentrate my mind on study, I just go to bed, But when I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> lay </ERR> down on <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> bed, <ERR type=[pr4,-3]> them </ERR> mini concert begin I can hear a few boys join their party.
After I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> heard </ERR> the Rock and Roll's music, I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> lost </ERR> my appetite.
I have <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> travel </ERR> two places, Xian and Hangzhou.
I was told that <ERR type=[fm3,-][wd4,-s]> xian </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> a </ERR> an ancient city and has many historical monuments.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Size </ERR> terra- cotta figures.When I steped into there, I felt uncomfortable, every <ERR type=[fm2,-]> where </ERR> is so serious, everyone's <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> pace </ERR> looked so sad.
I could say nothing beautiful <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> there, </ERR> only saw many clay figures, everywhere is so solemn.
Though the <ERR type=[wd3,1-5]> guild </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> explain </ERR> to us so patiently.
I didn't understand why, that is one of <ERR type=[pr4,2-1]> them </ERR> rules.
The guide explained that the excavation of the <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> underground </ERR> vault of earth revealed thousands of terra-cotta warriors and their horses in battle <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fomation </ERR> , and the whole army would follow its emperor into immortality.
After the travel of <ERR type=[fm3,-]> xian </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> We </ERR> went to Hangzhou.
Hangzhou has many <ERR type=[fm1,-]> senic </ERR> spots.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Such </ERR> as Monastery of the Spirits' Retreal, Pagoda of six Hammories and West Lake.
Hangzhou is famous for its <ERR type=[fm3,-]> west </ERR> Lake, it has such places of interest and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.
This is the second largest island in West <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ake--Landscaped </ERR> in typical Chinese style.
The guide as a pretty girl .She told us the story about this island, I was so <ERR type=[aj4,-s]> interesting </ERR> , Until now.
We sat <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> on </ERR> the oat and enjoyed the beautiful scene.
I suddenly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pelt </ERR> that I became a fairy maiden.
<ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> Travling </ERR> in the fairyland.
On both <ERR type=[np6,1-]> side </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> of </ERR> lake, there are two dikes--the Bai and the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> su </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> You </ERR> can see a row of vigorous willow trees.
They are decorated with coloruful <ERR type=[np6,5-]> light </ERR> , so in the evening, you can imagine how beautiful it is, There are many lovers under the <ERR type=[np6,6-]> tree </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> High </ERR> class restaurant and the low class restaurant.
There is a beautiful girl at the door, standing behind a counter, she will ask you did you make <ERR type=[,-s]> reservation </ERR> > If not, she will lead you to a table.
[wd4,-2] Other one will bring you a small hot towel.
Another one will stand beside you, <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> waiting </ERR> you to order food, she often introduces the most expensive food or drinks to you.
She is so <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> skillful </ERR> I sometimes wonder whether she graduated from public <ERR type=[np6,1-]> relation </ERR> school.
People talk in low <ERR type=[np6,4-]> voice </ERR> .
Maybe,some people think the food of the high <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> clan </ERR> restaurant is cleaner than the low class one.I don't think so, I think the food is clean unless you go into their kitchen.
You must have good table <ERR type=[np6,1-]> manner </ERR> .
There is <ERR type=[np9,2-4]> not </ERR> this kind of case in low class restaurant.
We usually call "Da Pai Dang" <ERR type=[fm3,-][wd4,-s]> when </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> center </ERR> there, you will feel more comfortable, It seems everyone is your friend, you will <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> feel </ERR> like stay at your home, you can order food at your own will, Although the environment is not o good, you feel so free.
Instead <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> of </ERR> controlled by others.
After you finish the meal, you will think it is <ERR type=[aj2,-3]> worth </ERR> to spend money there.
Everybody has <ERR type=[np6,-s]> friend </ERR> .
Some <ERR type=[np6,-s]> peoples </ERR> have many friends.
Without friends, they will feel lonely, everything will <ERR type=[vp9,2-1]> became </ERR> meaningless.
To other people, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Making </ERR> friends is not <ERR type=[pr4,-1]> them </ERR> interest.They think building up friendship with a friend is wasting time, and friends will bring them trouble.
To <ERR type=[np9,-s]> another </ERR> people,they don't <ERR type=[wd7,2-2]> the </ERR> many friends.
They <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> found </ERR> real friendship <ERR type=[ad1,-s]> only </ERR> can be built up among two or three people.
So, different people have different <ERR type=[np6,4-]> opinion </ERR> to define friends.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> She </ERR> can give her hand to me.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> And </ERR> tries her best to help me get out of trouble.
It was very serious I felt too <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> sick </ERR> go to class.
I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> can </ERR> do nothing.
I didn't drink and eat, my illness became more and more serious.At that time, I missed my <ERR type=[ad1,0-1]> so </ERR> much family, I even cried on the bed.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> And </ERR> gave me a few words of comfort.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Because </ERR> I was so moved that I could not help crying .I realized I really had a real friend.
I observed some different <ERR type=[np6,1-]> phenomenon </ERR> which people treat their friends.
When some girls have boy <ERR type=[np6,4-]> friend </ERR> , they don't like to make other friends, even <ERR type=[np6,-s]> girlfriend </ERR> .
They only like to spend all the spare time with their <ERR type=[np6,1-]> lover </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> And </ERR> become more and more unsociable and uncommunicative.
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Weeven </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,-1]> talk </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> heart </ERR> each other.
Many times, after she went back home, I felt very lonely <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> on </ERR> campus and waited for her return.
Yesterday morning, something happened to us, I am used to <ERR type=[vp4,2-]> listen </ERR> to the VOA at 7:00 AM.
So rose and I are the last two <ERR type=[wd4,-]> ones </ERR> to leave.
' I couldn't help jumping up from the chain and crying <ERR type=[fm3,-]> and </ERR> then.
I turned back, "Oh,my God, it is you," I shouted angrily, "You want to scare me to <ERR type=[wd2,3-]> die </ERR> "?
I felt a little pain on my neck, "I just wanted to play with you, I didn't mean it, why you <ERR type=[wd1,-s]> are </ERR> so <ERR type=[aj2,-2]> angry </ERR> to me" She replied and her voice seemed almost to cry.
I didn't look at her and sat back to my <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> chain </ERR> .
I thought <ERR type=[wd5,0-1]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-]> myself </ERR> that maybe I was too serious just now, we always make joke.
It was nearly the time for <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> clan </ERR> .
I took the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> bookbag </ERR> and walked to the <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> chain </ERR> .
My mother entered <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> into </ERR> my room and moved out my treasured recorder.
eally, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> This </ERR> humorous conversation gained Rose's smile.
For the past two months, almost every afternoon, I found it hard to <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> fan </ERR> asleep while your recorder kept playing certain music.
Although most of the songs were my favourites as well, I did find they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wore </ERR> not played at a right time, for I think the eriod of time between 1:00p.m and 2:30 p.m should be the time f st.
Yesterday, you kept playing the Rock <ERR type=[fm2,-]> roll </ERR> songs in a <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> loudly </ERR> voice throughout the afternoon and I was orced to go out for a walk instead of sleeping.
Last Saturday night I was <ERR type=[vp7,2-2]> awaken </ERR> to find it was three o'clock in the morning.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Embarrassment </ERR> and even sadness.
Festival party is for everybody and ll the <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> attendance </ERR> have the chance to <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> participate </ERR> the activities rather than just sit and watch.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Dancing </ERR> and cheers.
We could all sense the gay atmosphere then and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wore </ERR> delighted that colorful new days were coming soon.
Since I considered myself a close friend of the host, I used to act like a bee, often talking <ERR type=[np8,-2]> many </ERR> irrelevant nonsense ,doing many unnecessary things.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Academic </ERR> atmosphere and entertainment activities etc are concerned.
<ERR type=[vp5,-s]> Locating </ERR> at the foot of Baiyun Mountain , GUFL enjoys a autiful and <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> tasteful </ERR> environment, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Which </ERR> allows its people to work and study in a peaceful way.
One can be free of the noise and excitement downtown, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> breatheing </ERR> the pure and fresh air here and taking a rest on the meadows or in the shadows of the trees.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Which </ERR> lies nearly at the center of the city, the noise and the polluted air from the busy traffic nearby and <ERR type=[wd5,-3]> the </ERR> several large markets and shops surrounding it <ERR type=[vp3,-s]> does </ERR> make people on the campus suffer a lot.
Occasionally you can have a public lecture or sth else, but most students are not very interested in it and the <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> attendants </ERR> are always less active.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Dancing </ERR> performance and poem reciting etc.
Owing to its large scale, every department is responsible for its own <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mattes </ERR> .
This course <ERR type=[vp1,-6]> emphasizes </ERR> more on training the student's ability of listening comprehension and spoken English and it also includes certain amount of exercises for writing and reading.
The whole textbook is divided into about forty units, each dealing with a topic of life, culture, history, geography science, medicine <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> and </ERR> etc.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> Listening </ERR> writing and speaking practice.
All these exercises are concerned <ERR type=[wd3,-]> about </ERR> the topic of the unit.
For example if the unit is about <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Cuisine </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> You </ERR> will need to read several passages about, say,the various styles of cuisine, the making of certain Chinese dishes, the <ERR type=[cc4,2-5]> proper </ERR> wrong of using western table wares etc.
Having gone through the passages, students will be instructed to some do exercises, say, writing down some points of the idea <ERR type=[vp5,7-3]> embodies </ERR> in the passages.
Through these oral <ERR type=[np6,2-]> practice </ERR> , the students will be able to not only practise their spoken English, but also express their own ideas upon the topic.
Before the teaching of each unit, students will be given a <ERR type=[wd5,1-5]> word </ERR> list of the new words and phrases to help them.
However, a lot of improvements are still needed to make it <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bettor </ERR> serve the purpose of teaching English majors Friend The dictionary has varied explanations for the word " friend " ranging from " person one knows and likes "to" helper to " supporter " No matter how <ERR type=[wd2,-s]> different </ERR> people view " a friend" as surely there is one thing in common, a friend should be a person who is familiar with you and you two do enjoy a relationship.
The friendship may make you believe that at least there are your friends in the world who will care about you and you may <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> talk </ERR> to for help.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> For </ERR> your friends will assure you that they will always stand by you and be ready to help .
A <ERR type=[np6,1-]> friends </ERR> is a person who will do all the needed things for you without being asked for or paid for.
I can not imagine what my life will be if I fail to find any friend but only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> emimies </ERR> and hypocrites.
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frends </ERR> are part of my life.
The wind was blowing so fiercely that <ERR type=[vp3,1-2]> it </ERR> drive almost everybody back to his warm house.
Wandering aimlessly in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> long, </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> peopleless </ERR> street.
When they passed a gate which had a severe wire screen, their feet were tempted by a sweet song of hymn, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> Oh, </ERR> what a peaceful little song!
" The father couldn't help looking through the window to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> see </ERR> <ERR type=[vp5,2-0]> what' </ERR> happen.
[,0-4] He <ERR type=[wd7,2-2]> put </ERR> is younger daughter, fm2,-] who was not more than 3 on his shoulder and let the older one stand beside him.
They discovered a <ERR type=[np5,4-7]> wonderful </ERR> work on the other side of the gate, a warm, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> cheerful, </ERR> totally <ERR type=[wd4,5-6]> different </ERR> from the one they are living.
There was a young, amiable mother sitting at a stove in which the cheerful fire is radiating its red, warm light generously to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> whold house.
[fm2,-] However, on the other side of the gate, you can't find any cheerfulness but sadness and the feeling of longing for something.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> what a big cake they have!
They have so <ERR type=[np6,4-6]> many </ERR> candy and a dog who can dance!
" As <ERR type=[fm1,-]> she </ERR> though of this, her mouth was watering.
But a gale <ERR type=[cc4,0-1]> of </ERR> keen <ERR type=[vp1,5-8]> wind </ERR> made the poor <ERR type=[vp9,4-2]> girl </ERR> couldn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> help </ERR> shiering with cold.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> [fm2,-] </ERR> He elder sister with baggy clothes and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rumblered </ERR> fair hair, was <ERR type=[vp1,-]> staring </ERR> that amiable mother.
The other inside made <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> she </ERR> think of her own mother who left her only a vague but warm memory.
[fm2,-] The father, who was as baggy as his two daughters, stared fishily forward.
A <ERR type=[np5,2-2]> deep </ERR> melancholy obviously remained on his face.
At about 6: 20 am, after a long struggle and <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> self-encourage </ERR> , I manage to leap from the bed in great strength and enormous speed, This very action usually triggers a lot <ERR type=[np6,3-3]> of </ERR> complaint from the person who is sleeping on the above bed.
In the ten mintues from 6:20 to 6: 30 the <ERR type=[wd2,1-3]> begin </ERR> of <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> morning </ERR> exercise, the washing room is an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> extrimely </ERR> popular place to go.
I take a great <ERR type=[wd2,4-3]> difficult </ERR> in wedging myself into <ERR type=[wd7,4-3]> a </ERR> chink between too people and begin washing.
But how unfortunately I <ERR type=[fm3,-]> am, </ERR> the person standing beside me has a habit of washing violently, splashing water everywhere on my face and clothes.
But I have no time to quarrel for there are <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> half </ERR> dozen people waiting behind.
[fm2,-] Then there comes another fighting-racing to the playground at sonic speed.
I am running in this army, looking firmly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> and </ERR> anxiouly at the destination, taking every slice of energy to try to touch the rushing line.
But this time, not for the gold medal, just for not having my name recorded on the teacher's little <ERR type=[fm1,-]> muster </ERR> boll for coming late.
[fm2,-] The morning exercise lasts only five mintues.
The five mintues exercise is a kind of relaxation for the later fiercer <ERR type=[fm1,-]> competition- </ERR> rashing to the student's dinning room.
If you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> don't </ERR> harry up a bit, you'll probabally have to wait in the line , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> and </ERR> ore importantly, the most delicious food would have been <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sold </ERR> ut.
[fm1,-] Due to y <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tremedous </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> speed, </ERR> I am <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> always </ERR> the several persons who get to the dinning room first.
So I get my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> breakfast </ERR> easly.
[fm3,-] sometimes I have a bowl of rice noodle and sometimes one or two buns.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> But </ERR> alase!
[fm3,-] Because I have to finish the breakfast and return <ERR type=[wd5,1-]> back </ERR> to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> domitory before seven o'clock, the time for listening to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> English </ERR> programm in radio.
So I devour those buns <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> and </ERR> noodle and this fast movement of mouth makes my stomach uncomfortable a whole morning.
[fm2,-] Then I succeed in reaching <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> domitory before 7:00.
Thanks <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Heaven, </ERR> before the <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> class </ERR> begin, I have a short period of time to <ERR type=[wd3,-]> release </ERR> a little bit after all.
At the railway station Waiting train in <ERR type=[np6,1-0]> railway </ERR> station is almost a very happy and tiring experience in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> China, </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> espetially </ERR> her in Guangzhou.
[fm2,-] Last winter holiday, I had <ERR type=[fm1,-]> an </ERR> unfotfetable experience in Guangzhou railway station.
My friend Zhang saw me off <ERR type=[vp6,4-2]> and </ERR> help me carry a big <ERR type=[fm3,-]> bag, </ERR> when we arrived, we were frightened by such a <ERR type=[fm2,-]> scene: </ERR> thousands or even millions of people huddled outside the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> station, </ERR> pushing o and fro, yelling and jostling.
Most of them were peasants who came to Guangdong <ERR type=[fm1,-]> provinee </ERR> to find jobs and at that time they re about to go back home to <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> spend </ERR> Spring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Fastival </ERR> with their families.
[fm2,-] When I took great trouble in wedging myself in the waiting room, I found I have my hand bruised.
Some even slept on the floor using their bag <ERR type=[np6,2-0]> as </ERR> pillar and slumbered heavily.
I looked around and discovered a seat was occupied by a very dirty <ERR type=[fm1,-]> big </ERR> gunnysack which was obviously owned by the girl sitting beside.
Actually, the girl was sleeping with her dust-covered <ERR type=[vp5,4-2]> face </ERR> expose to everybody.
[fm2,-] Her hair was wild like coarse grass.
Her two legs opened widely and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> extented </ERR> to a long <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> distant </ERR> but one of <ERR type=[np6,3-5]> her </ERR> hand was holding tightly her sack.
[fm2,-] Move away your bag!
" This great voice seemed <ERR type=[fm1,-]> to </ERR> starltle the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> girl, </ERR> she opened her eyes suddenly and looked frightened like a hurt bird.
At that time, I found the girl was very <ERR type=[fm3,-]> pretty, </ERR> she looked at most 16 years old.
She raised her amazing beautiful eyes looking at us <ERR type=[wd7,-]> heedly </ERR> and them <ERR type=[vp6,13-5]> quickly </ERR> move the sack off the seat.
[fm2,-] I sat down and smiled at her and <ERR type=[vp6,5-5]> she </ERR> return me a sweet smile too.
[fm2,-] Then we began a friendly chat.
She told me about her parents, her younger brothers and sisters <ERR type=[fm1,-]> and </ERR> them she <ERR type=[fm1,-]> claimed </ERR> poundly that she was good at pushing in the crowd and never bothered to buy a ticket and never failed to escape ticket checking.
But Suddenly, she stopped her mouth and became watchful as <ERR type=[np7,4-3]> if </ERR> a experienced hunting dog smelt something unusual.
Remember, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ook </ERR> only <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ahead, </ERR> push hard with all your strength forward!
" <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> Almost </ERR> the same time, the crowd began to gather towards the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> door, </ERR> everybody looked very determined and prepared for a <ERR type=[fm3,-]> war, </ERR> the great pushing forward movement began.
Children were crying and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> women </ERR> screened everywhere.
[fm2,-] The situation was very dangerous.
I couldn't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> reathe </ERR> and I just wanted to cry.
I almost ate the hair of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> girl </ERR> net to me.
After about <ERR type=[np4,2-2]> 10 </ERR> minutes deadly struggle, I found myself standing on the train alive.
A friend of mine who is working for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> CITs </ERR> GuangZhou branch as a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> torist </ERR> guide, often has many stories about her job to tell.
She called on <ERR type=[fm1,-]> me </ERR> nexpectedly at my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dormitory </ERR> .
She was rather thin, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> campared </ERR> with <ERR type=[wd7,7-5]> the </ERR> precious time I had seen her, she seemed to have lost 5kg weight.
[fm2,-] Her face <ERR type=[aj3,3-4]> was </ERR> darker and full of weariness.
And then she <ERR type=[fm1,-]> began </ERR> hr endless and angry complaint about her new job.
She said with great dislike "Everyday I have to get up very early, sometimes there is even no time to <ERR type=[wd4,7-1]> finish </ERR> breakfast.
And then I have a group of <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp5,6-1]> people </ERR> fellow me wherever I go, which makes me feel like a fool.
" Knowing so much disadvantages of the job, I almost made up my mind that <ERR type=[np6,1-4]> tourist </ERR> guide was the worst job in the world.
Then I asked her: "How about <ERR type=[pr4,3-1]> changing, </ERR> you job and try to find another one?
You get a lot <ERR type=[np6,5-4]> of </ERR> tip if you are Lucky.
He was in his late 30's and looked physically strong and mentally keen, advancing with big and rapid <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strides </ERR> n the street where only a few numbers of people were wandering.
One of his <ERR type=[np6,4-3]> long </ERR> hand was swinging forcefully, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> accompanying </ERR> the movement of his legs, while the other hand seemed never to be moved away from the pistol hung on his loin.
He was always watchful <ERR type=[np7,1-3]> like </ERR> a excellent hunting dog and prepared to draw upon the gun to deal with any unexpected attack at any time.
He was wearing a belt round his waist in a casual way and <ERR type=[wd7,1-5]> a </ERR> packet watch <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shining </ERR> n <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> un.
He had a long and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ough </ERR> face with clear edges and corners.
That kind of roughness was only owned by those who had experienced innumerable dangers <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nd </ERR> trauma.
Although the brim of his hat had <ERR type=[fm1,-]> almost </ERR> elipsed his eyes, you could feel two columns of cold lights projected from them which would made everybody shiver with fear.
There is no doubt <ERR type=[wd4,5-2]> that </ERR> unusual was about to happen at his destination.
Mrs Brown, I am writing to you to express <ERR type=[wd7,2-1]> my </ERR> treat <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unsatisfaction </ERR> about <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> nbearable noises your family have made and your ignorance <ERR type=[wd3,-]> on </ERR> my last complaint letter.
Every morning, Your family gets up as early as 6:00 and your <ERR type=[fm2,-]> warmming </ERR> up morning exercise follows.
I know your husband is a basketball coach, but it doesn't mean that he has <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> the </ERR> to bounce the ball heavily against the floor under which several people are still asleep.
We are all waken up by such dreadful <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> bouncing </ERR> noise and my old grandma is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sually </ERR> frightened and made sick.
After the ball stops <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> making </ERR> noise, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suppose </ERR> a family <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sportsmeet </ERR> is taking <ERR type=[wd4,14-2]> place, </ERR> we <ERR type=[np6,2-3]> hear </ERR> noise of rope skipping which vp3,5-5] sounds like a working cutting machine and then I guess you must have other activities, such as high jumping and hurdle racing.
The enormously big noises come abruptly which <ERR type=[vp9,1-2]> can </ERR> made people mad.
I <ERR type=[vp7,2-2]> won't </ERR> surprise one day there will be a <ERR type=[vp5,5-3]> hole </ERR> appear in the floor and somebody will fall down if you continue <ERR type=[fm1,-]> to </ERR> stramp your feet with so much force on it.
<ERR type=[np6,1-0]> In </ERR> evening, things are not better <ERR type=[np6,5-0]> than </ERR> morning.
You always turn on your H. F. to the highest volume <ERR type=[,0-1]> and </ERR> I sure everyone on the neighbourhood knows you have owned a H. <ERR type=[fm2,-]> F. </ERR> The sharp, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> noise </ERR> ervades everywhere in our room, <ERR type=[,9-11]> which </ERR> is unable us to hear clearly the play in our own TV.
I hope the medical exam report of my grandma won't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> have </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,3-0]> may </ERR> problem, or I will phone the police <ERR type=[fm1,-]> and </ERR> cal my lawyer to handle this business.
Your angry neighbour <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Mrs </ERR> john Friends <ERR type=[fm3,-]> I </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> have </ERR> had Friends I have had can be generally classified to two <ERR type=[fm3,-]> types: </ERR> One is the type I need most when I am in a good mood.
[fm3,-] The other one is needed when I am in trouble, feeling frustrated, deflated or I have something that has to be confided.
Usually, friends of the first kind are those who have fairly cheerful, <ERR type=[wd4,4-2][fm1,-]> lively, </ERR> socialable personality.
They are good <ERR type=[vp2,4-1]> at </ERR> making <ERR type=[vp2,0-1]> fun, </ERR> playing joke and creating humorous and happy atmosphere.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> On </ERR> weekens, I usually go to movies or to <ERR type=[np6,6-3]> karaoke </ERR> bar with such people and always come back with excited and <ERR type=[np6,4-0]> delightful </ERR> feeling.
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Especially, </ERR> when I am going to have a birthday party, these friends become very essential.
They are the most dynamic elements in the party, enlivening the atmosphere with all their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> capabitities </ERR> .
They are shuttling here and there among the crowd, like butterflies or little rats, dallying with <ERR type=[fm2,-]> people, </ERR> making faces, talking nonsense in order to make others laugh.
Sometimes they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hehave </ERR> like a fool or a clown and <ERR type=[wd7,4-7]> never </ERR> cure what the other people think of them.
They make everyone feel relaxed and happy, without any doubt, having people like <ERR type=[fm3,-]> them, </ERR> parties often end up with quite a success.
<ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> Heating </ERR> my long, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> breakless </ERR> complaint, she looked even more furious than <ERR type=[fm1,-]> I, </ERR> cletching her fist and <ERR type=[wd7,5-4]> teeth, </ERR> curing with all her <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strenth </ERR> "Really a bad egg!
<ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> A </ERR> damn egg!
" At that time I was rather confused, for I couldn't make clear whether the fellow who offended me was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> enimy of her or mine.
We both sat <ERR type=[wd4,4-2]> there </ERR> kept cursing until my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tougue </ERR> was tied.
Surprisingly, the feeling of <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> angry </ERR> went away.
Friends of the second type not only can share your <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> angry </ERR> but also your sadness.
If I tell a sad story of me to <ERR type=[fm2,-]> them, </ERR> usually, their tears have already fallen down even before I have enough time to concentrate all my strenth to produce some.
[fm2,-] They are the people who are worth of my respect and faith.
But I love friends of the second <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kind </ERR> mush more, for they are my really reliable good companions.
> <TYP 2> weng yao A Letter to My Neighbour Dear Mr Smith, I'm sorry to inform you of some facts which <ERR type=[vp6,2-1]> have </ERR> bothering me for months.
The noise coming from your house day and <ERR type=[wd7,9-5]> night </ERR> twins my life into a disaster, I could <ERR type=[fm1,-]> no </ERR> linger keep pace with a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> regular </ERR> routin both during the daytime and at night .
[fm3,-] this wears my patience away and finally drives me to ask you to have mercy upon my weak nerve!
Each morning when I wake up, my eyes were swelling and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> red, </ERR> this <ERR type=[wd5,-]> was </ERR> became the noise ,which was so loud and piercing that could drive people <ERR type=[,4-8]> crazy, </ERR> floating out of your windows a hole night long.
[,0-15] People <ERR type=[fm1,-]> upstairs </ERR> where laughing, chatting, even shouting, in <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> addition </ERR> the sounds of throwing <ERR type=[wd7,-]> ards </ERR> and mixing .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> [fm3,-] </ERR> he Majiang on a table were also clear.
In <ERR type=[wd7,2-2]> the </ERR> titlner of night, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> all </ERR> there noises were <ERR type=[fm1,-]> serving </ERR> an edles piercing through the ears <ERR type=[vp1,0-3]> and </ERR> caned <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> me </ERR> feel tinnitus and headache in the daytime .
What's more, <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> your </ERR> addcition to singing has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> no </ERR> night <ERR type=[vp4,1-2]> to </ERR> made <ERR type=[vp1,2-3]> me </ERR> suffering from <ERR type=[wd7,3-2]> no </ERR> neat at noon I must say you couldn't deprive me of the last chance to have a sleep !
[fm3,-] why do you always play the Karo O.K.
[wd4,4-1] noon?
[fm3,-] Could you please turn the voice a little bit down?
To be <ERR type=[wd2,2-0]> honesty </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,10-7]> , </ERR> it sounds just like wild shrieks and howls .
[fm3,-] as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> I </ERR> ouldn't enjoy my precious rest at noon, I always feel <ERR type=[fm3,-][wd3,0-3]> sleepy, </ERR> sometime I even doubt I have got <ERR type=[fm3,-]> neurostheria, </ERR> as you could easily see from my face , I'm not myself anymore!
I hope this letter <ERR type=[vp4,1-1]> could </ERR> drown some of your attention and the <ERR type=[,2-4]> situation </ERR> to be improved, even slightly.
I'm looking forward with all my <ERR type=[wd4,7-3]> heart </ERR> a quiet night, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> of </ERR> coarse, with your help.
Friends I Have Had Two kinds of my friends: one is active <ERR type=[wd7,4-0]> and </ERR> oacious, the other is quiet and withdrawn, who are <ERR type=[wd7,3-1]> seemingly </ERR> throughout different, have accompanied me through my life from childhood till now.
They are always cheerful, preparing for any joke or mischief <ERR type=[fm1,-]> at </ERR> ll time.
[fm3,-] however what attracts <ERR type=[fm1,-]> me </ERR> moat is their <ERR type=[,0-9]> wisdom, </ERR> no matter where <ERR type=[fm2,-]> out </ERR> standing <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> performance </ERR> ensures spoting them easily.
because they are quick-witted, they <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> are </ERR> teacher's favorites and always the winners of any math-competitions.
Dealing with such friends, you will be easily infected with their light hearts and humorous <ERR type=[fm1,-]> "remarks"-always </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mischivors </ERR> bur not ill-willed-and you will be influenced unconsciously by their flexibility and elasticity, <ERR type=[vp3,4-6]> which </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,5-5]> is </ERR> a <ERR type=[np6,7-3]> major </ERR> component of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> their </ERR> haracteristics , and sub-consciously become more adaptable <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> to </ERR> new environment .
[fm3,-] to be short, those <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> people </ERR> makes you more active towards life.
However, if I hadn't the other kind of friends, my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> life </ERR> woud have been incomplete and I <ERR type=[vp7,2-0]> myself </ERR> paralyzed.
They are always timid, sensitive and <ERR type=[fm3,-]> sentimental, </ERR> you could hardly <ERR type=[,4-4]> predict </ERR> what is their intrinsic quality.
They look like ice, but inside they are fine, burning silently <ERR type=[fm1,-]> and </ERR> ometimes, when you reach their heart, this <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> fine </ERR> will warm you and light your eyes.
Two schools during my middle-school study, I have <ERR type=[np7,3-3]> changed </ERR> the school <ERR type=[wd3,3-0]> 3 </ERR> time.
One is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> an </ERR> xperimental school in a coastal area, the other is in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> my </ERR> ometown, which is isolated from the outside <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> by </ERR> range of mountains.
The experimental school is a fairly large one and modern one in <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> content </ERR> with my hometown school.
It has more than 1,000 students and teachers, the school buildings are six-floored, which is rare <ERR type=[np7,4-2]> for </ERR> the ordinary middle-school, and it has a standard sports ground which is covered with sand around and well-cut grass in the centre.
[vp5,0-8] Comparing with it, the ground of my hometown school, which is only covered with mud and weeds and <ERR type=[wd7,10-3]> becomes </ERR> disabled in rainy season simply becomes a <ERR type=[fm2,-]> play </ERR> ground for children to ride bikes or playing kites in the spring.
All the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> equipments </ERR> and facilities of the experimental school are newly bought or established.
<ERR type=[wd7,-]> That </ERR> became it's a newly set-up school with a history of less than 15 years.
The experimental school, since located in the coastal <ERR type=[cc3,9-2]> area, </ERR> <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> recieves </ERR> much influence from overseas adapts an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> open </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> teaching-mathed </ERR> , that is, to put more emphasis on the student's ability in performing well not only from an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> acdemic </ERR> angle, but also from the moral, physical and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> artistical </ERR> point of view.
Besides this, they also exchange students and teachers with its counterparts abroad and often bolds discussions even debates among <ERR type=[fm3,-]> students, </ERR> by this means, students are supposed to develop comprehensively.
In comparison with it, the hometown school still concentrates on the traditional teaching method--- teacher- <ERR type=[fm3,-]> centrism, </ERR> among those classes at <ERR type=[np6,5-3]> different </ERR> grade, you can find their curricula are fully <ERR type=[fm3,-]> arranged, </ERR> there's no spare time left for students to learn by themselves, not <ERR type=[wd3,-]> mention </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd7,3-5]> time </ERR> prepared for them to practise computers, work out the model airplanes or play the musical instruments as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> their </ERR> connterparts in the experimental school do.
It's obvious that both teachers and students are aiming at one thing: entering <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> to </ERR> university or colleges, as their ultimate purpose!
I know that most of the months you're out on business, <ERR type=[cc5,1-6]> which </ERR> leaves your home sometime like a battlefield, a sport field or a bar.
Every morning, I'm waken up not by my alarm clock (I'm afraid its sound now is too weak for me), but by your children's quarreling <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ver </ERR> who should make break fast.
It <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> often </ERR> last over an hour.
Michael Jackson's <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pops </ERR> songs may be their favorite , they never forget to play it when they "fight".I feel <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ever </ERR> terrible in the afternoon.
Your kids choose the floor as a <ERR type=[cc4,-]> skate </ERR> field.
With Michael Jackson or some heavy metal on the tape, they imitate their singing, shorting , jumping .I can only pray that the floor won't be broken.I'm afraid you know little about your kids.In the evening, they seldom <ERR type=[np6,1-]> make </ERR> noise, instead, I often hear <ERR type=[np6,1-]> some </ERR> scream or crying from the <ERR type=[wd2,0-2]> horror </ERR> video tapes they play.
Either a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> short </ERR> of "Ghost" or "I'll call of you !
" make me <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tremlle </ERR> .
Or the gunfire, or a savage <ERR type=[pr1,7-0]> laughter, </ERR> they arouse my imagination and I'm really living in a might <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm2,-]> mare </ERR> .
Could you be so kind <ERR type=[wd5,2-]> enough </ERR> to spend a little more time at home and tell your kids to make less noise?
There is a kind <ERR type=[np9,5-2]> of </ERR> teachers who like to read what's on the text books.
[pr1,10-1] He is too prudent to have his own opinion.
When I <ERR type=[pr1,12-1]> attend </ERR> their classes, all I have to do is to take notice of where the teacher is reading and make a mark there.
No note is necessary even though <ERR type=[wd7,1-1]> teachers </ERR> <ERR type=[fn2,-]> chink </ERR> oppositely.
Also the whole class is rather <ERR type=[fm1,-]> uiet </ERR> .
Some are reading novels, some are writing letters, some are even listening to walk <ERR type=[fm2,-]> man </ERR> , leaving the teacher by the platform <ERR type=[vp5,1-0]> practising </ERR> read-aloud.
But another kind of class,not like <ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> the </ERR> fore said one, makes us dictating all the time.
We are kept writing like machines, <ERR type=[fm1,-][fm1,-]> occasionaly </ERR> look up at the teacher with a begging expression, "Could you please slow down your reading?
" Time <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eems </ERR> to never pass normally in such kinds of classes.
[vp1,0-20] There are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> still </ERR> ome teachers both follow the text book and have their own opinions and most of all, let us have time <ERR type=[vp4,5-2]> to </ERR> think, to exchange ideas at class.
[fm1,-] <ERR type=[fm2,-]> ome </ERR> times I take note of the information not in the text book, sometimes follow the teacher's instruction to think , to develop my opinion.
TWO SCHOOLS The first <ERR type=[fm1,-]> impress </ERR> <ERR type=[pr5,2-6]> on </ERR> that schools A and B give you are different stepping into school A,you'll see a small garden with roses, camellias, cannas and other colorful flowers .
[fm1,-] long each side of the road is a line of Chinese parasols.
From the board on the gate of the building, you can see it's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> onated </ERR> in 1992 by a well- off patriotic overseas Chinese While over the garden, the main building in A--the English teaching building, was built 50 years ago, Some windows are broken, too.
While in B, a single physics Department has <ERR type=[np1,2-3]> 35-storey </ERR> buildings as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> regwlar </ERR> classrooms and a T-storey laboratory building.
Another notable thing you may easily find is that there are much more girls in A than in B. <ERR type=[fm3,-]> that </ERR> mainly due <ERR type=[np9,2-2]> to </ERR> that fact that A in a college of languages and B <ERR type=[np3,2-1]> is </ERR> science university.
Not like other major English courses like College English or Comprehensive English, CECL course is more vivid and effective for students' <ERR type=[np1,0-4]> first </ERR> two years of basic training in colleges.
Traditionally, students are faced with a long text with numerous new words and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammers </ERR> and they have to prepare a lot before the new lesson: look up the new words <ERR type=[wd3,-]> on </ERR> the dictionary, preview the text and so on.
Words phrases and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grammer </ERR> are the centre of their study.
But for CECL, there is a specific topic for each unit, such as family, to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wris </ERR> and sport .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Gcturally </ERR> , there are few long passages <ERR type=[np6,4-2]> or </ERR> text in CECL, but more listening ,speaking and writing exercises.
When the lesson begins, some simple questions related to the central topic are raised by the teacher and comes a small <ERR type=[fm2,-]> warm </ERR> up discussion .Usually there is <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> an </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> according </ERR> record <ERR type=[np7,-]> by </ERR> foreign <ERR type=[fm1,-]> expent </ERR> or the same <ERR type=[np6,0-5]> topic </ERR> student then listen to the tape, sometime take notes, to see how's the conversation going.
<ERR type=[fm1,-][fm3,-]> fter </ERR> that, the teacher helps the student go through some specific terms for the unit.
For Tourism, there will <ERR type=[np7,3-5]> be </ERR> the introduction of famous scenic spots in China and abroad.
They are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> devided </ERR> into several groups and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> try </ERR> their best to present vividly some situational dialogues to the whole class.
There are almost 20 practical topics in <ERR type=[wd3,8-3]> CECL, </ERR> concerning a wide range.
But equally more <ERR type=[pr1,4-3]> of </ERR> these are ruled out.
Students are the centre of the <ERR type=[wd3,-]> lesson </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> in </ERR> stead of the teacher, which, few other courses can have this as a characteristic.
He pats on your shoulder to give you strength and a sign of under <ERR type=[fm2,-]> standing </ERR> when you lose a match .Passing you a towel or a rink, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> one cannot always be the champion <ERR type=[fm3,-]> don't </ERR> let <ERR type=[fm1,-]> yourself </ERR> own!
He <ERR type=[,2-12]> understands </ERR> when you part with your girl- friend much better than your parents do .
He <ERR type=[fm1,-]> shorts </ERR> your ears when you've lying lazily on bed a whole day, "Hey ,guy, enough rest !
Do not be a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lagy </ERR> bone!
" Sometimes, he is a patient brother, in other time, he is a good guy to play with , and he could be <ERR type=[wd3,-]> one </ERR> instructor as serious as an old grandpa .
Also, he needs your comfort when in bad <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mosd </ERR> and invites you to enjoy his happiness.
He may have some shortcomings, as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> on </ERR> one is perfect .
He is always <ERR type=[wd3,-]> on </ERR> your mind and he always gives you courage and confidence.
But when I got there, no assistants could <ERR type=[fm1,-]> been </ERR> seen.
" the latter and younger one tried to soothe the elder assistant , " <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Nowad </ERR> ay, people are crazy for money!
"Excuse me," I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hesitatly </ERR> asked, "May I return the books now?
" <ERR type=[fm3,-]> well </ERR> , No, when I started reading I found the <ERR type=[wd7,-]> wants </ERR> already there.
"" Why didn't you <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fell </ERR> us when you borrow it ?
<ERR type=[wd7,1-2]> It </ERR> want be you !
I had thought the assistants must have made all the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> checkings </ERR> and I had been in a hurry when I borrowed it .
[fm1,-] " <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> Two </ERR> man for each place.
but I'd like to make a complaint <ERR type=[wd3,-]> with </ERR> you .
I find <ERR type=[wd7,3-2]> myself </ERR> smote by noise, which has a rather bad effect on me .
I know that you are a musician and have made a small <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> name </ERR> of your own.
But when you are going to bed , you drop the shoes on the floor and the sound is loud enough to awake and <ERR type=[wd3,-]> start </ERR> me.
I haven't had a good sleep for days now, neither can <ERR type=[wd3,3-5]> I </ERR> make it up in the morning, for then, you are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> plactising </ERR> your saxophone.
It not only puts an end to my repose, but also makes me unable to hear <ERR type=[fm1,-]> the </ERR> whether broadcast on the radio or the news about stock market on TV.
You host a party every weekend and will not <ERR type=[wd3,-]> disperse </ERR> it until 2 o'clock in the morning.
If you would please to <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd7,5-3]> dissoloe </ERR> the party earlier, put down the shoes gently and postpone your time of practising <ERR type=[fm1,-]> saxphone </ERR> I would be much obliged .
Yours sincerely Three kinds of friends enter my life, tinge it with colours and add its richness: the close friends, the nodding friends and the <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> good-weather </ERR> friends.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> appriciate </ERR> and truly love my close friends, because I an confide in them <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nd </ERR> in return I am trusted by them, I <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> precious </ERR> such friendship.
Though there are no frequent exchange of presents and no <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> sweet </ERR> flatter between us, I m clearly aware that they really care for me as much as <ERR type=[wd4,9-1]> I </ERR> them , and will jump with alacrity at my asking for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> elp </ERR> .
They give me their hand when I am in bad time, listen patiently to the troubles I pour out to them, and some <ERR type=[fm2,-]> how </ERR> remove it magically .
To stay with them is happy because I can wear my <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> heart </ERR> on the sleeve and need not keep myself to myself.
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Straight </ERR> for word remarks <ERR type=[np6,3-2]> even </ERR> criticism are welcomed.
We can get along well by joking talking story-telling or playing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ogether </ERR> , though we would not touch the deeper issues of one's mind.
[fm3,-] We pick up some general and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> afe </ERR> topics like what happens to a friend recently, or whether she or he likes the job or what <ERR type=[pr5,2-2]> place </ERR> where I visited last summer vocation.
When we <ERR type=[pr1,3-]> depart, </ERR> it become a part of the memory.
No regret for departure, but is willing to meet next <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ime </ERR> .
To those <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> good-weather </ERR> friends, I dislike them.
They <ERR type=[wd7,2-3]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> adows </ERR> in the sun and will disappear into this air as soon as darkness befalls.
No.2 Middle School is a key school in Guangzhou, there <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fore </ERR> in comparison to the former one, it is <ERR type=[aj3,3-3]> more </ERR> strict in many aspects.
2 Middle School has <ERR type=[aj3,s-]> higher </ERR> demand for the entrants.
Because of its fame, is school attracts many students who hope that they can <ERR type=[wd4,2-4]> better </ERR> education <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nd </ERR> training for the college <ERR type=[np6,3-1]> entrance </ERR> examination.
Good and potential students are enrolled, <ERR type=[wd7,6-1]> thers </ERR> rejected.
While the Attached School is only a common <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chool </ERR> , although it is quite famous for its <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nglish </ERR> teaching and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aclievements </ERR> , it attracts far less students, not to speak of scientific students.
The grade line for the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> extrance </ERR> is correspondingly lower.
The overall quality of he tudents, there <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fore </ERR> , is not encouraging .
Second, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> he </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> NO.2 </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> MiddliSchool </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ets </ERR> up a higher standard for its students on their study.
The textbooks, especially maths, physics and chemistry textbooks it <ERR type=[wd7,9-3]> ases </ERR> are more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> diffult </ERR> than those <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> of </ERR> Attached School.
While in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ttached </ERR> School , due to the overall quality of the students, most of them are <ERR type=[vp7,5-2]> only </ERR> require to understand and master what the textbooks say and use these <ERR type=[fm1,-]> knowledgt </ERR> to do the exercises that are not difficult to deal with.
In addition, the strictness of NO.2 Middle School is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lustrated </ERR> in its daily-life.
the leaders are very much <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oncerned </ERR> with students' appearance and behaviour.
Students are forbidden to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> coear </ERR> ornaments, boys are not allowed to have long hair, long <ERR type=[vp3,2-1]> fingernails </ERR> is unbearable.
Further <ERR type=[fm2,-]> more </ERR> , students are required to wear uniform at least 3 <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ays </ERR> a week.
Even <ERR type=[wd7,2-2]> in </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oozen </ERR> winter mornings, girls have to wear their uniform of western-style dresses.
Students are free to wear colourful clothes, and have small ornaments to <ERR type=[cc6,-]> add </ERR> up their beauty.
This is away <ERR type=[wd7,3-2]> vigorates </ERR> the campus.
CECL, the full name of which is Communicative English for Chinese <ERR type=[np6,5-6]> Learner </ERR> is a set of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> comprehersive </ERR> textbooks.
It covers such knowledge as greeting people, job, food , sports, tourism, economy, and so on <ERR type=[wd4,3-4]> , </ERR> each aspect as a unit.
[fm1,-] ne characteristic of CECL is its large amount of new words.
Therefore, before the start of a new unit , he teacher will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ive </ERR> each student a list of the new words of the unit .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Futher </ERR> preparation depends on the tasks which will be done in class.
After that, the teacher will give the answers and analyse the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tcpscrips </ERR> .
Then comes the second exercise, reading usually, students are required to read the articles before class, look up some words , and have a rough idea of the out <ERR type=[fm2,-]> line </ERR> of the articles.
<ERR type=[np6,1-3]> In </ERR> the class the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> teacher </ERR> ill explain some language points and draw students' attention to some useful words and expressions.
When the students <ERR type=[vp4,4-3]> have </ERR> make clear of the contents exercise be done, which help the students to a better understanding.
It provides <ERR type=[np6,3-3]> good </ERR> opportunity for the students to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prictice </ERR> their spoken English.
And by listening to others <ERR type=[fm1,-][np6,5-2]> opinion </ERR> , they have a deeper impression about the text.
[pr3,14-3] They are the writers as well as actors.
<ERR type=[wd2,0-1]> General </ERR> speaking, CECL is an unique course in <ERR type=[np6,0-2]> which </ERR> teacher and students play equal roles.
Students <ERR type=[fm1,-]> volutarily </ERR> take part in the activities and there <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fore </ERR> master the knowledge more effectively .
But it does not exclude boredom, an in <ERR type=[fm2,-]> dispensible </ERR> element <ERR type=[pr5,3-10]> without </ERR> whose <ERR type=[wd7,3-9]> contrast </ERR> life would no longer appears so interesting and wonderful .
Students often suffer from boredom, when they lose their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> earings </ERR> or have no interests in study.
Hollowness and impatience often occupy <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> their </ERR> heart and <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> has </ERR> a effect on their further studies.
Hobby and different <ERR type=[fm1,-]> hings </ERR> they take up .
Attending class may be dull , because some of the knowledge is losing its attraction, and the way in which some teacher <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> lecture </ERR> bores the listeners.
The teacher will simply stand at the platform, reading at the top of his voice the sentences which we can find in the text <ERR type=[fm2,-]> book </ERR> .
" How <ERR type=[fm1,-]> boreing </ERR> it is!
" is the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> concensus </ERR> we get after each class.
It seems <ERR type=[fm2,-]> contra </ERR> dictary at the first sight.
But if we know that monotony and repetition are often the <ERR type=[wd7,3-2]> featlres </ERR> of work, it is not difficult to see that even you have something to do at hand.
Boredom is a common disease in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> souety </ERR> , but not an incurable one.
The best way to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> frive </ERR> it away is to find something which is really of your interest, do it and enjoy it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> a </ERR> young man was standing behind me ,one hand taking hold of the iron bar overhead .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> as </ERR> the bus picked up more passengers along its route, I began worrying about thieves.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> luckily </ERR> I had never met them, though I often heard about their "good deeds " on buses .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> so </ERR> consciously, but pretending to be carelessly , I touched my pocket.
The money was there, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> save </ERR> and sound .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> several </ERR> minutes later, I was aware that a woman was looking at me strangely, her face wearing an expression that I couldn't fully explain.
[fm3,-] he was quite <ERR type=[fm1,-]> uncomfortable </ERR> under my staring and hastily looked away.
But I was not <ERR type=[fm3,-]> trapped </ERR> my friendly manner made <ERR type=[wd4,5-3]> him </ERR> at a loss.
"um um, " he made his head move up and down, and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> squeazed </ERR> a smile on his face .
He was not that nervous , but was still embarrassed to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> be </ERR> caugh red-handed.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> hope you good luck next time," I said <ERR type=[vp6,3-0]> and </ERR> smile.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> thank you .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> he was almost grateful at my words and even friendly patted my shoulder.
[fm3,-] as the bus stopped, I jumped off, and <ERR type=[wd7,2-8]> could </ERR> at wait to tell my friend all about it .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> you must <ERR type=[fm1,-]> be </ERR> crasy," she said, " aren't you afraid that he would stab you ?
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> " </ERR> no, I was <ERR type=[fm3,-]> not </ERR> it was a strange but true experience.
[fm3,-] perhaps he was not a bad guy at all and perhaps in his eye ,I was still <ERR type=[fm1,-]> a </ERR> na* <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ve </ERR> but daring little girl.
Patriotism This is an event nearly every Chinese <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mailand </ERR> people and Hong Kong people alike have been awaiting with <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> massive </ERR> excitement and great expectation -- the reunification of Hong Kong to China.
It is a moment of celebration, <ERR type=[wd2,4-1]> proud </ERR> , anticipation and above all, the most telling moment of patriotism which is deep in our <ERR type=[np6,1-]> heart </ERR> .
To people, on numerous occasions, it is a mighty <ERR type=[fm1,-]> momentom </ERR> , spurring us to <ERR type=[cc3,-4]> implement </ERR> the most formidable tasks which would have been impossible otherwise.
<ERR type=[np7,-2]> In </ERR> Olympic Games, you can not only feel the touching emotion of patriotism, but also come face to face with it: you see how athletes surmount the various "hurdles" with <ERR type=[fm1,-]> applaudible </ERR> stamina and most important, fortitude, whose <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sourse </ERR> is exactly their love of their country; you see athletes fall from illness but stand up to their task even with a dripping; you see athletes stumble to the ground but climb up and go ahead; you also see champions cry <ERR type=[fm1,-]> movedly </ERR> when their national flag <ERR type=[vp4,4-1]> rising </ERR> proudly.
At <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> such </ERR> moment, they are no longer themselves, rather, their country and their people who also embrace the same burning patriotism and back them all the time.
Outside the stadium, patriotism draws people to TV, <ERR type=[np6,5-]> newspaper </ERR> , focusing on what's going on in the games; even they would fly to the spot somewhere far far away from their <ERR type=[np6,12-]> home </ERR> .
With it, not only have we weathered untold defeats, shame, poverty, natural disasters, political strife, financial crisis, but also we are <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> building </ERR> up our country industriously and hopefully.
The recent years have witnessed the prosperity in our <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> economics </ERR> , advancement in education, improvement in diplomacy ... .
To a country, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Patriotism </ERR> means <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> cohesiveness </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> Cohesiveness </ERR> means omnipotence, With it, we are fearless.
With this in mind, we have been <ERR type=[vp2,-2]> making </ERR> our utmost to negotiate and eventually reach an agreement on the issue of Hong Kong territory <ERR type=[np7,-2]> with </ERR> British <ERR type=[fm1,-]> governement </ERR> but <ERR type=[pp1,15-3]> for </ERR> all the barriers.
This dream has been both <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> long </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd3,7-]> hard </ERR> for us, while, in the end, the reality in the wake of the dream is sure to be promising and encouraging.
With the same patriotism in mind, we're to live up to our designated aims ahead -- to embrace <ERR type=[fm3,-]> HongKong </ERR> and still to come, Macao and Taiwan and to better an <ERR type=[fm1,-]> integret </ERR> China all the time.
Though she is <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> little </ERR> educated, she has a good sense.
I used to live with her and my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> counsins </ERR> when I was small because my parents were too busy to look after me .
She got up the earliest in the morning and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sleeped </ERR> late at night.
She worked hard <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> yet </ERR> without complaining.
As she had <ERR type=[vp6,2-6]> been </ERR> busy ever since she was young, she looks older than she really is.
Her face is wrinkled, her hair turns silver white, and some of her teeth become <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> movable </ERR> .
Though her grandchildren have grown up and the family <ERR type=[fm1,-]> condiction </ERR> has improved, she refuses to do nothing.
She had just <ERR type=[vp6,3-8]> been </ERR> to school for several years but she <ERR type=[fm1,-]> taugh </ERR> us how to act through her experience.
My Dad When I began to write this article, I wondered what information I would get from my memory about my father because, sometimes, Dad seemed so strange to <ERR type=[sn,s]> me. </ERR> .
Dad <ERR type=[vp6,7-]> was </ERR> one of the most ordinary kind of people with few words.
The deepest impression about him in my mind <ERR type=[vp6,8-]> was </ERR> his <ERR type=[ad2,1-2]> always </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> rough </ERR> face.
In my childhood, I was usually too scared to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> look </ERR> him in the face.
Sometimes I would feel <ERR type=[wd3,3-3]> shamed </ERR> of his ordinariness.
An episode happened and changed my <ERR type=[wd3,-]> perception </ERR> towards dad.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2]> At </ERR> that night, I was so surprised to find dad singing songs and talking loudly and excitedly all the time.
It seemed that something which he had hidden in his heart for a long time <ERR type=[fm2,-]> bursted </ERR> out.
And I found the things I had neglected or so many years <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> at </ERR> that night.
Families <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> decorate </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> home </ERR> inside and outside after they <ERR type=[vp6,8-3]> had </ERR> a spring cleaning.
During the time, Xmas tree is very popular because people think it can bring good luck, and then in every home, there is a beautiful Xmas tree decorated with coloured <ERR type=[np6,9-]> light </ERR> .
Sometimes, in many communities there is the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> costom </ERR> of decorating a big Xmas tree for out-door display.
Before the Xmas Eve, most people exchange presents and send Xmas cards to their friends, relatives and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> bussineers </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,6-]> associate </ERR> .
Before going to bed, children hang their stockings <ERR type=[np7,5-1]> by </ERR> fireplace, hoping some sweets and toys will be given by Santa Claus.
<ERR type=[np7,1-1]> In </ERR> USA, especially Handel's Xmas <ERR type=[fm1,-]> choral </ERR> music "Messsiah" <ERR type=[vp3,5-1]> are </ERR> heard everywhere during the season over the radio, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> On </ERR> TV or in department stores.
To compare with the western Xmas, the <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> Spring <ERR type=[fm3,-]> festival </ERR> exists the similar <ERR type=[s8,s]> points, </ERR> it is also the biggest <ERR type=[fm3,-]> chinese </ERR> holiday.
On New Year's eve, each family has a great reunion dinner, and the peak of the celebration activities <ERR type=[vp3,6-4]> fall </ERR> on New Year's Eve and the day after.
For instance, the people will stay up till 12 o'clock, then they will cheer themselves up and burn the <ERR type=[cc3,3-]> firecrackers </ERR> , do some bless <ERR type=[vp2,4-2]> for </ERR> each other, etc.
According <ERR type=[np7,-2]> to </ERR> Chinese tradition, making jiaozi (dumplings) on the fifth day of the lunar Calendar will bring good luck in the new year.
On the night of Yuan Xiao, also known as the Lantern <ERR type=[np7,-2]> Festival, </ERR> Chinese custom calls for the display of Lanterns inside or outside of the <ERR type=[wd3,5-]> homes </ERR> , according <ERR type=[np7,-2]> to </ERR> Taoist belief, the Lord of Heaven visits the earth on the Lantern Festival to confer Luck and happiness on those who are morally upright.
After reading all <ERR type=[pr1,1-1]> this </ERR> things above might help you widen your horizon to know more about the western culture and the eastern one.

He favored Copernicus theory which declared that the earth <ERR type=[vp6,5-2]> is </ERR> a planet which <ERR type=[vp6,8-1]> revolves </ERR> around a fixed sun.
For to do so, he was be delivered to the torture Chamber of <ERR type=[sn,s]> Inquisition. </ERR> .
Although he was compelled to renounce his belief, he didn't give up <ERR type=[wd3,4-3]> flighting </ERR> with the Inquisition <ERR type=[fm1,-]> untill </ERR> he died on January 8, 1642.He left the world he loved far better informed than it was when he entered it.
Nowadays, scientists have proven that in some special <ERR type=[np6,2-]> situation </ERR> , we can show the potential of our physical ability and do something we can not do in usual <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> time </ERR> .
Suppose the boy was about to kill his father, the words "I am going to kill you" should sound more hoarse and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> terroble </ERR> , different from the words "I'll kill you" we said in our daily life.
Secondly, I am still not sure whether the woman <ERR type=[fm2,-]> weared </ERR> her glasses or not when she was tossing and turning.
One of my friends often goes to bed, forgetting to put <ERR type=[vp2,3-2]> off </ERR> her glasses, and she often finds that <ERR type=[np7,13-2]> the </ERR> next morning.
Christmas and the Spring Festival The Spring Festival in China and the Christmas in USA are both the <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> most </ERR> festival of the year.
In those days, the <ERR type=[np6,-4]> people </ERR> in the two countries have vacation to celebrate the new year.
And <ERR type=[np7,-1]> the </ERR> Christmas also has a fairy tale to celebrate the birth of Christ.
The Spring Festival and <ERR type=[np7,-1]> the </ERR> Christmas are also different.
In those days, people <ERR type=[vp6,19-]> decorated </ERR> the gate with the traditional color of red, especially the red lantern and the couplet with blessing words.
In the United States, the spirit of Christmas arrives about a month before the holiday itself, December 25. ate in November, street lights and store windows are decorated with the traditional Christmas <ERR type=[np6,-4]> color </ERR> of red and green.
Fir <ERR type=[np6,1-2]> tree </ERR> , holly wreaths, and mistletoe are familiar sights.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2][np7,-2]> In </ERR> Spring Festival, most of the Chinese will go home from other places to have a family reunion.
It's the most important and <ERR type=[aj3,3-]> happy </ERR> thing to all the Chinese, because we have a most <ERR type=[aj3,2-]> deep </ERR> love <ERR type=[pp1,1-2]> to </ERR> the relatives.
On Christmas, many American families go to church and enjoy a traditional Christmas dinner just <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> like </ERR> Chinese, but I don't think <ERR type=[pr1,19-]> it's </ERR> as important as to the Chinese.
And now more and more people going to church is only for <ERR type=[sn,s]> fun. </ERR> .
Both in the Spring Festival and on Christmas, are <ERR type=[wd1,10-]> children </ERR> the happiest because they can get a lot of gifts.
In <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> American </ERR> , children could receive toys from Santa Claus in their stockings and they exchange gifts with their parents under the Christmas tree.
Besides they can also get money from their grandparents, <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> aunts, </ERR> uncles.
I like the days <ERR type=[np7,-2]> of </ERR> Spring Festival, for I can relax to my heart's content.
Do you think the <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> art </ERR> course and the science course should be completely separated?
The <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> art </ERR> and the science are two different courses, but they <ERR type=[vp7,2-3]> connect </ERR> to each other very much.
The <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> art </ERR> trains people's understanding skill, and the science trains people's logical skill.
However, the understanding and the logical skills are both very important in the <ERR type=[wd3,2-4]> art </ERR> and the science.
In China, from <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> senior </ERR> school we <ERR type=[np7,2-4]> separate </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,2-3]> art </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,3-2]> from </ERR> science completely.
How to study the <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> art </ERR> and the science, here I have some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opion </ERR> of my own.
Actually good studying methods are all good to the <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> art </ERR> and the science.
However, the <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> art </ERR> and the science lay particular stress on <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> them </ERR> .
For example the <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> art </ERR> needs more memory and the science requires more observation; the <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> art </ERR> students should have more understanding <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> efforts </ERR> and the science students with more logical <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> efforts </ERR> are better.
In studying <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> art </ERR> , you should have more patience because there are a lot of things for you to memorize and most of the things are very similar to each other.
The <ERR type=[wd3,1-3]> art </ERR> and the science are of the same importance to our society.
I believe if we were good at both of them, the society would <ERR type=[fm1,-]> develope </ERR> more quickly, I hope the day is not far away.
[,s] <ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I was ten <ERR type=[np6,1-]> year </ERR> old, I was sent <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> to </ERR> countryside, stayed <ERR type=[wd3,-]> in </ERR> my uncle's.
Approaching the Mid-Autumn Festival, I was <ERR type=[wd7,6-]> still </ERR> happy, but on that night, everything changed.
When my favorite food <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> were </ERR> set <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> on </ERR> table, everybody was ready to enjoy <ERR type=[pr4,1-]> them </ERR> , I was sad at the sight of the moon, because I missed my family very much.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> at </ERR> that night I was thinking about how lonely I was without my family around me to share the food <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> night </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> .Even </ERR> tears came into my eyes.
I couldn't tell how <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> sorrow </ERR> I was!
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> But </ERR> this year, I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> don't </ERR> .
I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> have </ERR> stayed in the campus.
Because I have <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> had </ERR> an appointment with a young man with whom I almost <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> fall </ERR> in love.
I was very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> excited </ERR> and a little nervous that night.
On that night, we sat by the west Lake <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> in </ERR> the campus, looking at the bright full moon talking.
We talked about our <ERR type=[np6,1-]> childhood </ERR> , our present <ERR type=[np6,2-]> life </ERR> , our family members and Chinese literature about moon.
To my joy, we <ERR type=[fm3,-]> are </ERR> both keen on Chinese literature and we <ERR type=[vp6,8-]> have </ERR> much in common.
I wished my most memorable Maid-Autumn <ERR type=[np1,-3]> night </ERR> would last for ever.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> got together, talked freely and ate the traditional food.
We talked about <ERR type=[np1,-2]> experience </ERR> of life, <ERR type=[np1,-2]> experience </ERR> of study and almost everything.
The traditional food included <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moon-cakes </ERR> , fruits, peanuts and riversnails.
Spending the whole night with them, I relaxed myself and forgot the burden of my <ERR type=[np1,3-0]> study </ERR> .They all <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> treatly </ERR> me nicely.
I will never forget that night --- the most <ERR type=[aj3,-1]> happy </ERR> Mid-Autumn Festival night in my life.
I decided to spoil her for the particular <ERR type=[fm1,-]> occation </ERR> .
I bought a large splendid <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> delicate </ERR> birthday cake.
My sister-in-law had a gift for her <ERR type=[fm1,-]> two </ERR> .
After having dinner, my family <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> were </ERR> all sitting together watching TV.
Then TWO large <ERR type=[np3,2-]> birthcake </ERR> turned up.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> it </ERR> t was 12 pm and it was time for us to set off.
Afterwards we sat down together eating mooncakes and watching the partial lunar <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eclips </ERR> .
It was meaningful for us to see the lunar <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eclips </ERR> at the Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
Everyone has his/her beautiful memory about Mid-Autumn Festival night, for it is such a mice moment for Chinese <ERR type=[np7,2-]> people </ERR> , What's mine?
Mine is eating <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moon-cake </ERR> and fruits and appreciating the round golden moon with my family.
When I was young, I spent 15 such <ERR type=[np3,2-]> night </ERR> at home <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> with </ERR> father, mother, brother and sisters.
<ERR type=[pp1,-3]> At </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,1-]> that </ERR> happy <ERR type=[np3,3-]> occasion </ERR> ) my mama always told us stories about the moon, <ERR type=[vp6,6-]> talks </ERR> about the Moon Goddess.
Every year , the <ERR type=[np3,2-]> story </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> was </ERR> different and attractive.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> But </ERR> now I will never have <ERR type=[wd4,4-]> such </ERR> chance.My mother <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> parted </ERR> away and I always spend my Mid-Autumn Festival at school .
Oh, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> My </ERR> memorable Mid- <ERR type=[fm1,-]> autumn </ERR> Festival <ERR type=[np3,3-]> night </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> )is </ERR> only in my memory.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> every </ERR> one has <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> spent </ERR> many Mid-Autumn <ERR type=[fm3,-][np3,2-]> festival </ERR> and every one has their mot memorable <ERR type=[np3,7-]> one </ERR> .
My <ERR type=[fm1,-]> meroble </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> mid-Autumn </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> festival </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> night </ERR> is the one of last year.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> why </ERR> ?
Because it was the fist time that I didn't spend <ERR type=[pr1,-1]> those </ERR> festival with my family.
Fortunately, I made friends with five girls who came from different <ERR type=[np3,1-]> place </ERR> of Guang Dong <ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> live in the same dormitory.
I will never forget <ERR type=[wd6,-]> mid-Autumn </ERR> mid-Autumn <ERR type=[fm3,-]> festival </ERR> night in 1996 in my life life.
[wd6,-] Mid-Autumn Festival is one of our Chinese traditional festivals.
People enjoy the festival very much, because almost all the embers of the family will get together and it is always very fun.I like this festival very much , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> most memorable <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> a </ERR> Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the one two years <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ago.It's </ERR> a <ERR type=[np7,-1]> exception </ERR> , for I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> selebrated </ERR> it with my friends near my house , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> carrying </ERR> our lanterns, mooncakes fruit, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> and </ERR> spent the whole night on the mountain playing games, watching the <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> moon, </ERR> eating the food.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> It's </ERR> very <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> fun </ERR> to make a wish under the moonlight.
The most laughable thing was that one of my <ERR type=[np3,2-]> friend </ERR> ate clay , instead of the mooncake,because of the darkness.
We slept for a while <ERR type=[fm1,-]> untill </ERR> dawn.
It was very <ERR type=[aj4,-s]> excited </ERR> , and from that night, I realized that friends must share their trouble and <ERR type=[np3,-2]> joys </ERR> .
I had known that I would have a chance to watch the moon changing from a bright round one to a dark one , on the <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> night </ERR> .
I waited patiently for the appearance of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grant </ERR> sight.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> about 2 'clock, the moon changed into a smaller and smaller NEW MOON.
Suddenly it became a <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> complete </ERR> dark one.
Little by little it <ERR type=[vp1,-s]> turned </ERR> a round one.
I have ever seen the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grant </ERR> sight before.
I had a wonderful time and <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> missed </ERR> those delicious <ERR type=[np3,2-]> food </ERR> very much.
I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> can't </ERR> forget that Mid-Autumn Festival night which I spent with my university colleagues.
As a rule, people spend that night with their families, but I have to leave my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mice </ERR> family for university.
For the first Mid-Autumn Festival at university, we had prepared the delicious fruits and some mooncakes --- the two things we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> can't </ERR> lack for such a traditional festival.
The most memorable thing during that night was playing charades with my <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> colleagues </ERR> .
From the Family <ERR type=[fm1,-]> AIbumn </ERR> U. S. A. we <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> should </ERR> play American games on such a Chinese traditional festival.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> I'd </ERR> never had so memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.
Sometimes thing may go on beyond your belief and <ERR type=[wd2,-s]> thus </ERR> was what happened to me last Mid-Autumn Festival.
I was sitting alone in my room and listening <ERR type=[ad1,1-1]> sadly </ERR> to the noisy and joyous <ERR type=[np6,s-]> sound </ERR> outside that night when there was a knock on the door.
I opened the door and could see a box of <ERR type=[np3,2-]> mooncake </ERR> on the doorstep.
Smiling, she said "Happy Mid- <ERR type=[fm1,-]> autumn </ERR> Festival.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> It's </ERR> on Tuesday last week that the Autumn Festival <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> met </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> friends and I enjoyed a happy night.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> It's </ERR> the first Autumn Festival that I spent in college, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> it's </ERR> very <ERR type=[fm1,-]> special </ERR> , I felt.
I followed my friend to her relative's home in order to have a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> delcious </ERR> supper.
Before we arrived there, they had prepared all the dishes, <ERR type=[vp6,5-]> they're </ERR> of many delicious kinds.
We enjoyed the supper and had a very happy <ERR type=[fm3,-]> time.after </ERR> the meal, we can taste many kinds of <ERR type=[np3,2-]> fruit </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> ,it's </ERR> the most favourite meal that I had in Guangzhou, <ERR type=[cj1,-s]> since </ERR> we <ERR type=[vp6,5-]> can't </ERR> do anything but have meals from dinning hall, and every student complains of these bad meals including me .
After we came back to our dormitory, my roommates and other people who <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> lives </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,-3]> as </ERR> the same building as we do enjoyed a very very happy night.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> <ERR type=[vp4,-]> layed </ERR> lanterns together <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> and </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> so </ERR> so I can say last Autumn Festival Night is the most unforgettable one!This year's Mid-Autumn Festival gave some memorable things to me , it was a wonderful day.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> my </ERR> roommates and other new friends were together playing some wonderful and enjoyable games, but the most important thing is that I had chance to get to know new friends.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> And </ERR> I could eat my favourite food, such as moon <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cakes </ERR> , fruit, etc.
Although I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couldn't </ERR> come back to my house always missed my family and my lovely dog.
I could only give my parents a call, but I <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> can't </ERR> feel depressed.
Because I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> don't </ERR> try <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> it </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> befor </ERR> this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.
On that night, you can eat a lot of things, such as mooncakes, fruit, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rivernail </ERR> , <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> teak </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ect </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I left home, I spent the most lonely Mid-Autumn Festival Night, also it's y most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.
On that night I ate whatever I <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> want </ERR> to.
After a delicious meal, <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> I'm </ERR> full as the fullmoon.
It was for <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> babies </ERR> , so I sat at my desk le.
Unfortunately, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> It </ERR> so happened that they were out.
My loneliness was getting more and <ERR type=[wd4,-s]> more </ERR> , <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Starrng </ERR> at the full moon.
It was my only partner on such a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> only </ERR> Mid-Autumn Festival.
Do you spend your Mid-Autumn Festival Night in <ERR type=[fm3,-]> The </ERR> same way like me?
I always <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> spent </ERR> that night with my family.
We often sat together in front of the house, <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> talking </ERR> everything, eating things, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> but </ERR> ,on the most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night, I was alone.
<ERR type=[pp2,-s]> Around </ERR> midnight, the moon became the roundest and the <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> lightest </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> on </ERR> that night.
At about one o'clock, the lunar eclipse began, and we could <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> only </ERR> see most part of it, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> and </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> could less of it later on.
<ERR type=[ad1,-1]> Almost </ERR> at three 'clock, we could no longer see the moon.
Since we <ERR type=[fm1,-]> can't </ERR> see the next lunar eclipse until sixty-years later, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> it's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> worthy </ERR> seeing it.I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> can't </ERR> forget that night for I <ERR type=[vp6,2-]> have </ERR> the chance of watching it.
I spent <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> most </ERR> memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night when I was in he junior middle school.
<ERR type=[vp6,6-]> It's </ERR> the first time that I <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> hadn't </ERR> stayed with my family during the Mid-autumn Festival night.
It happened that the day was Saturday, and almost all the residents far away from home stayed in school.I missed my family very much, because it was the traditional festival for Chinese family to <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> stay </ERR> together.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> But </ERR> I was a one and I had no <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moon-cake </ERR> .
TO my surprise, one day students carried their <ERR type=[fm1,-]> on-cake </ERR> and fruits to my dormitory.
) a beautiful <ERR type=[np3,8-]> lantern </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> I was a little girl, I also liked <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> to </ERR> so with other children in our big yard.
My most memorable Mid-autumn Festival night was the night when I was <ERR type=[fm1,-][np3,1-]> eight-year </ERR> old.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> after </ERR> having supper, I went out lighting a lantern which I liked very much.
With my little good friends, I came to the Dongjinag river bank and saw some people playing <ERR type=[fm1,-]> firecrafts </ERR> .
Suddenly, a "rocket" <ERR type=[fm1,-]> flied </ERR> to me.
It was a pity that I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> couldn't </ERR> let my lantern hang in the balcony through that night.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> And </ERR> it was so unforgetable and memorable.
My friends and I brought all kinds of <ERR type=[np3,2-]> food </ERR> , <ERR type=[np3,1-]> fruit </ERR> and cold drink to the lawn, <ERR type=[pr1,-s]> where </ERR> were already full of happy people, to celebrate the special night.
We also bought 2 beautiful lanterns, but one of them was burned a hole because the lighting candle in it was <ERR type=[wd3,-]> tilted </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> But </ERR> when we saw that, we couldn't <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> laughing </ERR> and thought it was unforgettable.
Moreover, when we opened 2 bottles of Pepsi-Cold, the <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> drink </ERR> in them spurted our faces suddenly, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> looked at each other and convulsed with laughter.
How <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> fun </ERR> it was!
While we were appreciating the most <ERR type=[aj3,-1]> bright </ERR> full moon in this year, we were enjoying all kinds of delicious things we <ERR type=[vp6,s]> bought </ERR> , talking, singing and dancing like any other people.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> Then </ERR> we spent a happy night.
During the first month, I had to have military training, and my family <ERR type=[vp6,8-]> is </ERR> far away from University, so I had to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival night without my <ERR type=[wd4,3-]> parents </ERR> but my roommates for the first time in my life.
On that night, after bathing myself, I went to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compus </ERR> to enjoy the beautiful, round moon with my roommates.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> when </ERR> we were walking around, I saw a lot of people strolling and chatting with their families, their children holding a <ERR type=[np3,3-]> lantern </ERR> in their hands laughing or running around them.
I also saw some people sitting on the grassland eating fruit and <ERR type=[np6,-s]> mooncakes </ERR> and enjoying the bright moon.
All of these reminded me of my parents and the happy time I spent with my <ERR type=[np5,-s]> families </ERR> on Mid-Autumn Festival night.
This was the first time I <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wasn't </ERR> at home on such a special night and had no lanterns, no mooncakes <ERR type=[cj1,1-1]> and </ERR> other special things in season to eat.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> what </ERR> I had was he happy memories.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> before </ERR> I entered university, I spent all my <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Mid-autumn </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,-3]> festival </ERR> at home.
But last year, I left my parents and <ERR type=[vp6,4-]> enter </ERR> university.
Because my <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> house </ERR> is far way from here and we were having a military training at that time I had to stay here on the Mid-Autumn Festival.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2]> At </ERR> that night, we got two apples each one .
<ERR type=[np4,-2]> Roommates </ERR> and I went out walking .
<ERR type=[wd3,-s]> Since </ERR> we didn't know each other very well, and still were <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> strange </ERR> to our campus, we had a lovely <ERR type=[fm1,-]> time.It's </ERR> the first time I had <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> spent </ERR> the mid-Autumn Festival with strange classmates instead of my parents.
Also <ERR type=[fm1,-]> It's </ERR> the first step I became <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inddepent </ERR> .
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> That's </ERR> my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
I always spent my Mid-Autumn Festival with my family But this year, I entered the university, I <ERR type=[vp6,3-]> have </ERR> to spend my Mid-Autumn Festival with my friends.
We went to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> grass-land </ERR> to see the beautiful moon.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> and </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> had all kinds of <ERR type=[np3,2-]> food </ERR> food to eat <ERR type=[fm3,-]> everyone </ERR> enjoyed it.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> talked about the original tradition.
[fm3,-] we also played <ERR type=[fm3,-]> games.what </ERR> a good time we had!
The moon <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> in </ERR> that night was the <ERR type=[wd3,3-]> highest </ERR> the biggest and the roundest in this <ERR type=[fm1,-]> centry </ERR> .
That lunar eclipse was the most marvelous one of <ERR type=[pr1,-1]> those </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> centry </ERR> .It appeared at <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> mid-night, so he didn't go to bed <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> to </ERR> watch the <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> process </ERR> of it for it was really a good chance.
After that,more and <ERR type=[wd7,-2]> more </ERR> the moon was eaten, and the earth became darker and darker.
At last, the moon was eaten up, all the world became a piece of <ERR type=[cc1,3-]> dark </ERR> .
First it looked liked a boat, then half an <ERR type=[np7,1-]> cake </ERR> at last it was a full moon.
The earth was covered with silver again <ERR type=[fm3,-]> And </ERR> we could see each other again.
It was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unforgetable </ERR> .
The <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Mid-autumn </ERR> Festival I spent this year <ERR type=[wd4,-1]> is </ERR> most <ERR type=[fm1,-]> memorble </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> .it </ERR> was my first time to spend such a special night leaving home .
<ERR type=[pp1,-1]> At </ERR> night, we had a party on the playground.
We danced, sang, told stories and ate the typical food for this festival--- mooncakes and lots of delicious fruits as we <ERR type=[vp9,2]> appreciating </ERR> the beautiful full moon.
The light that the burning <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> firecrakers </ERR> gave out looked so beautiful in the dark night that we all cheered excitedly.
I enjoyed myself very much <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> at </ERR> that night.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> What's </ERR> more, I've got got closer with my classmates since that night.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> at </ERR> first, I thought I would be lonely, but I changed my thought at last.
My favorite thing in Mid-Autumn Festival is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moon-cakes </ERR> , since it is delicious, I like to eat so much at a time.
This was the first time I spent the special night without my family, but it <ERR type=[vp6,9-]> is </ERR> really wonderful and memorable, <ERR type=[vp6,5-]> isn't </ERR> it?
I always <ERR type=[vp6,-10]> spend </ERR> my <ERR type=[wd7,-1]> MA </ERR> Festival <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> Night </ERR> with my family.
Since then, it <ERR type=[vp6,-]> was </ERR> the most memorable night for me.
Later, we went out to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> champus </ERR> and decided to play <ERR type=[np7,1-]> a </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,-s]> game </ERR> .
These games included charades and walking <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> compete </ERR> by <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> tighting </ERR> one foot of one person with that of another, <ERR type=[cj1,s-]> then </ERR> made a <ERR type=[wd7,-2]> pair </ERR> with three <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> feet.SO </ERR> it's difficult for <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> the </ERR> to walk straight.
We always fell down because of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> uncooperation </ERR> .
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> So </ERR> it made great fun not only <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> to </ERR> ourselves but also <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> to </ERR> the people sitting around us.
We spent the night, eating , playing and <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> also </ERR> laughing.
Because I was <ERR type=[vp6,-s]> missing </ERR> my family.
I was in a little <ERR type=[wd7,-2]> low </ERR> .
Suddenly I heard <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> laughing </ERR> around me.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2]> At </ERR> the playground we talked, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> singed </ERR> and enjoyed the bright , round moon.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> moon-cakes </ERR> seemed to be specially delicious because of our happiness.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> then </ERR> we played charades.
This Mid-Autumn Festival night is the most <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unforgetable </ERR> and I'll keep it in my mind for ever.
Mid <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Autumn </ERR> Festival Night, <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> in </ERR> this year, is memorable.
This year I spent the Mid <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Autumn </ERR> Festival Night at school instead of at home.
TO my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suprise </ERR> , things were not as bad as I had <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> thought.At </ERR> that night many of my classmates and I went out to enjoy the round and bright moon.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> the </ERR> fruits that we brought <ERR type=[wd5,-]> at </ERR> that night.
When we played "two men three feet", some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pairs </ERR> couldn't cooperate well and they almost fell on the ground.
The games made us <ERR type=[vp1,2-]> laughed </ERR> all night.
The Mid <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Autumn </ERR> Festival Night <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> in </ERR> this year will be in my memory for ever.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Mid- </ERR> autumn festival is a traditional <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> occasion </ERR> in China.
People attach <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> important </ERR> to it.
<ERR type=[pp1,-2]> Before </ERR> several weeks, they prepare for it.
They will visit old friends and relations with moon <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cakes </ERR> moon to <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> keep </ERR> their friendship.
When I as a little girl, my <ERR type=[fm1,-]> gramma </ERR> would tell e the story about the moon.
We <ERR type=[vp6,9-]> sat </ERR> outside and <ERR type=[vp6,20-]> watched </ERR> the moon.
<ERR type=[fm1-]> Gramma </ERR> <ERR type=[vp6,8-]> told </ERR> me that there <ERR type=[vp3,-1]> are </ERR> a beautiful lady whose name is chang'er and her servant Wugang in the moon.
<ERR type=[wd5,-s]> and </ERR> Chang'er is accompanied by a beautiful rabbit.
n <ERR type=[wd4,2-]> ancient </ERR> a beautiful young lady didn't want o get old, so she stole some <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lixins </ERR> and took <ERR type=[wd4,2-]> them </ERR> .
TO her surprise, she became a fairy and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> flied </ERR> to the moon.
In id- <ERR type=[fm3,-]> autumn </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-]> festival </ERR> , you will see Waging cut a tree and the rabbit <ERR type=[fm1,-]> superintending </ERR> him.
Each time, my gramma told me e same story, but I was <ERR type=[fm1,-]> attaracted </ERR> by it.
There are many memories of <ERR type=[fm3,-]> Mid-autumn </ERR> Festival in my <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> brain </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-s]> .but </ERR> the most memorable thing is eating moon cake this year.
After supper <ERR type=[pp1,-2]> at </ERR> that night, my family were <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> sitting </ERR> around the table and watching the moon.
<ERR type=[fm3,-]> we </ERR> were happy <ERR type=[pp1,1-]> in </ERR> eating fruits and having <ERR type=[fm3,-]> jokes.when </ERR> we saw the whole round moon, my father said: " <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lets </ERR> eat moon cake.
But I was <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> treated </ERR> .
The moon <ERR type=[fm1,-]> came </ERR> was <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> not </ERR> usual one, it was made my <ERR type=[wd1,2-0]> by </ERR> cousin.
Of course, I didn't <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> know </ERR> .
Oh, I was <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> liked </ERR> a clown at that time, red eyes and red nose.
My family <ERR type=[fm1,-]> laughted </ERR> and I laughed too.
Although I was <ERR type=[wd7,-s]> treated </ERR> .
We all <ERR type=[vp6,8-]> like </ERR> to have fun.
I had a happy night <ERR type=[pp1,-3]> in </ERR> Mid-Autumn Festival.
[np6, -] towards them are vastly different.
Fortunately, <ERR type=[np9,-]> this </ERR> kinds of views have changed in China.
Instead of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> passimistic </ERR> waiting, they prefer to the progressive way to die.
Lastly, <ERR type=[wd4,s]> let </ERR> see the feasibility of it.
The social development has <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> enable </ERR> China to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratice </ERR> euthanasia.
There <ERR type=[vp3,1-4]> is </ERR> no scientific problems in it.
China also has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratised </ERR> in some area.
Apart from all these elements, some people <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> argued </ERR> that the legalized euthanasia may invite abuse.
It will be a good <ERR type=[wd4,s]> news </ERR> all the Chinese.
We can not refuse eating because of choking, all the <ERR type=[np6,2-]> thing </ERR> we need to do is to reduce the bad effects as well as possible.
(t8-11) The Gulf War had <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> been </ERR> over for two and a half years.
It will be written into history with its <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> bombards </ERR> thundering and fire burning.
Now it is all over, <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> though </ERR> it will appear in text books to illustrate war theories or <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> middle-east </ERR> policies.
Both <ERR type=[np3,1-]> side </ERR> have <ERR type=[wd3,-]> shown </ERR> their great courage during the war.
The Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Amerians </ERR> and others, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> everyone </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> fighted </ERR> bravely for their own country.
There are always wars, <ERR type=[np5,-]> fightings </ERR> and blood.
The <ERR type=[np6,s-]> purpose </ERR> of <ERR type=[np5,-]> fightings </ERR> are various --- power, freedom, land, resources, religion, and even women.
But one thing never changes with <ERR type=[np5,-]> time </ERR> or political <ERR type=[np6,4-]> situation </ERR> --- people believe they fight for their country, or their nation.
We can find examples very easily, from the war between <ERR type=[fm1,-]> antient </ERR> Greece and Rome, to World War II, during which faith to homeland was proved to <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> be </ERR> great power.
It was such power that helped people drive away <ERR type=[np6,s-]> fascist </ERR> <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> which </ERR> had thrived and prospered by destroying everything.
It is a deep feeling from one's heart, so <ERR type=[wd3,d]> does </ERR> love to one's nation.
<ERR type=[np3,s-]> Human </ERR> are social animals.
They are eager to be accepted by others, so they <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> gathered </ERR> and form tribes, nations, and states.
They have to pay for the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> acception </ERR> and protection --- that <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> is, </ERR> love, faith, and dedication to the country.
The Gulf War had <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> been </ERR> over, but other wars are going on and new wars will break out in the future.
(t8-12) Maybe our world wouldn't <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> exit </ERR> if there hadn't ever been wars.
Wars have greatly pushed the <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> society </ERR> advance almost in every respect, especially in science and technology.
The <ERR type=[np6,s-]> conflict </ERR> includes boundary problems, nation problems and religious problems, some of which have been <ERR type=[fm2,2-2]> hung-up </ERR> for centuries.
Of course, war <ERR type=[fm1,-]> reprents </ERR> the dark-side of the world and indicates the limit of man's mind.
For example, Tom stole Sam's wallet then Sam can report Tom to the police and the court <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> has </ERR> right to punish Tom.
Even if he <ERR type=[vp1,-s-][vp6,s-]> committed </ERR> to <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> protect </ERR> the verdict, his individual power is too weak to help him escape.
But as to the countries, there couldn't be a law which has force on all the member countries, because each <ERR type=[fm1,-]> independant </ERR> country has its own social system and no other country <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> has </ERR> right to manipulate it.
Though we have <ERR type=[wd4,-]> drawn </ERR> several international treaties, still some super nations can break them easily.
It won't disappear until man's spirit reaches to an extremely <ERR type=[wd3,2-1]> holly </ERR> degree.
Once war <ERR type=[wd4,2-]> breaks </ERR> no one can avoid it.
Just as we Chinese had to fight <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> back </ERR> Japanese devils in the <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> second </ERR> war.
All the wars have the same essence but <ERR type=[wd5,4-2]> the </ERR> different forms.
From <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> spear </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> sword </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,3-1]> gun </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,4-3]> tank </ERR> to biological weapons, atomic bombs and missiles.
Modern war has <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> put </ERR> emphasis on the sky than on the land.
We Chinese fear war because we're afraid to lose the present <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> peaceless </ERR> We have suffered so much from war that we'd rather the earth were destroyed than war <ERR type=[wd4,2-]> broke </ERR> But the fact is that no country can refuse war if it does come.
You don't mean to fight others but others want to fight you Mao Zedong has such a famous saying: we don't <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> offense </ERR> others until others <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> offense </ERR> us.
(t9-1) When our teacher wrote this topic <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> the blackboard, it aroused a heated dispute among our classmates.
One boy said with regard to either physical strength or intelligence, women are poorer than men, and since the differences <ERR type=[wd5,3-2]> are </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> exist, there is not any <ERR type=[fm1,-]> necessarity </ERR> to try to find equality.
Some other boys said that it is impossible to have <ERR type=[wd5,1-6]> a </ERR> real and absolute <ERR type=[np5,4-2]> equality </ERR> in reality.
So we should take the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> for granted and feminine movement is <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> just </ERR> waste of time and strength.
I don't agree with them, <ERR type=[wd3,d]> neither </ERR> What I believe is that the two genders should treat each other equally, that is, respect each other and understand each other.
<ERR type=[wd5,-2]> The </ERR> God <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> endows </ERR> us different <ERR type=[fm2,-]> appearences </ERR> personalities and abilities.
<ERR type=[vp1,-]> Discriminating </ERR> women not only <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> harm </ERR> women but also <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> waste </ERR> human resources.
So I think men who believe <ERR type=[pr3,6-]> he </ERR> is superior to women should learn to respect others, especially women.
The equality, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> which </ERR> I <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> thought </ERR> is not absolute equality.
It is unrealistic to require that the number of female presidents should be <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> exactly </ERR> same <ERR type=[wd3,2-5]> with </ERR> the number of male presidents.
What I think is that women should have more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oppertunities </ERR> in the society, such as in finding jobs promoting, or getting the same salaries.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oppertunities </ERR> also mean that <ERR type=[np3,1-5]> woman </ERR> could have their own choices, that is, if a woman wants to get out and find a job, she should have freedom to do so; If she chooses to stay at home, she would not be accused.
So woman liberation does not necessarily mean all <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> woman </ERR> should go out and find a job, but rather <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> means </ERR> give every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> the opportunity to choose by herself.
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Abuseing </ERR> women is a common <ERR type=[fm1,-][np6,2-]> phenomina </ERR> Therefore how can we think <ERR type=[fm1,-]> feminin </ERR> movement <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> is </ERR> waste of time and useless?
And when will women and men, all the human <ERR type=[np6,3-]> being </ERR> can exist <ERR type=[fm1,-]> harmonily </ERR> and equally?
(t9-2) Decades ago, <ERR type=[fm3,-1]> chairman </ERR> Mao, the great leader of Chinese revolution claimed: "Chinese women are half of the sky!
" Decades later, however, Chinese women haven't yet <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> own </ERR> half of the sky.
That Chinese women play an essential and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> indispensible </ERR> role in China can't be denied.
While the western countries launched overall women liberation <ERR type=[np6,4-]> campaign </ERR> China, also put <ERR type=[fm1,-]> foward </ERR> laws to protect women's rights.
According to statistics, only <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> 26% </ERR> government <ERR type=[np6,3-]> official </ERR> are women.
Though women <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> do </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phyiscally </ERR> weaker than men, they are no weaker in intelligence.
Unfortunately, men <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chavvinism </ERR> pervades.
A lot of people have a prejudice that women are unsuitable for management or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> politicis </ERR> Men <ERR type=[fm1,-][np6,-1]> chavvinist </ERR> revel in seeing <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> wife </ERR> cooking, <ERR type=[wd4,5-4]> washing </ERR> doing all house chores in the kitchen while <ERR type=[np6,s-]> husband </ERR> sitting comfortably and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lesurely </ERR> watching TV.
And when a woman <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> show </ERR> talent in managing, she is unlikely to be promoted, since the boss (usually <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> they </ERR> are male) <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> are </ERR> skeptical about women's ability.
The root of men <ERR type=[fm1,-]> chavvinism </ERR> is China's long feudal thinking influence.
<ERR type=[fm1,-1]> Confucins </ERR> proposed <ERR type=[np6,-2]> "husband </ERR> guide <ERR type=[np6,2-]> wife </ERR> " and "women's virtue".
Women's virtue means <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> " </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> wife </ERR> is subordinate <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> husband </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> at </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> husband's </ERR> disposal.
" So, when a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> excels, even nowadays, a lot of people still tend to consider her an unprincipled <ERR type=[np3,2-]> women </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> Since </ERR> according to women's virtue, a female shouldn't go beyond home, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> insteadly </ERR> <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> their </ERR> duties are doing homework and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> waitting </ERR> <ERR type=[pp1,-1]> on </ERR> husbands.
These old <ERR type=[wd3,d]> ethnical </ERR> codes if not <ERR type=[wd1,2-s-]> possess </ERR> a dominant part, at <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> least </ERR> a considerable place in many people's minds I can give you an example.
This year, a foreign trade company <ERR type=[fm2,-]> askes </ERR> for five <ERR type=[np3,1-]> graduate </ERR> in our institute.
Just five boys, otherwise, we would go <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> for </ERR> another college.
" It sounds <ERR type=[wd2,-]> somekind </ERR> ridiculous.
" That's cruel reality, women's ability <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> aren't </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> universially </ERR> acknowledged.
It's said Chinese women's social status <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> is </ERR> <ERR type=[aj3,1-1]> highest </ERR> in the world.
Chinese government even <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> put </ERR> high priority <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> in </ERR> women issues.
While the women's liberation organization <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> play </ERR> increasingly important <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> role </ERR> in western countries.
I call on Chinese women <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> become </ERR> more <ERR type=[fm1,-][aj2,-1]> conscions </ERR> about themselves.
Since the reason of the present <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> not only <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> go </ERR> to men, but also resides in women's part Some Chinese women <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> is </ERR> greatly influenced by <ERR type=[fm1,-]> conficusism </ERR> They take it for granted that women should stay at home, and it's no good for a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> to go to work and <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> become </ERR> focus.
Once I was asked by a girl: "What's your criteria for <ERR type=[np6,1-]> boyfriend </ERR> ?
" She was surprised: "What if your <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> boyfriend </ERR> a worker?
They can't marry a woman whose <ERR type=[cc4,-4]> background </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> degree </ERR> higher than themselves " At that time, I realized how <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> deep </ERR> the "women's virtue" <ERR type=[vp1,s-][vp6,s-]> effects </ERR> Today, Chinese women enjoy more and more rights and their legal rights are respected.
However, it's still time for us to say that they've <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> own </ERR> half the sky.
They haven't yet <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> own </ERR> half of the sky.
Therefore, I propose <ERR type=[np6,2-5]> feminist </ERR> would do good to women.
This is attributed a <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> lot </ERR> to the women's liberation.
Feminists have done a great <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> deal </ERR> good rather than harm to the cause of women.
The most outstanding goal of feminists is struggling for the equality with men in the fields of <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> economic </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,5-]> political </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> social </ERR> Their efforts have been proven very helpful to improve the women's status, especially in the first and the last <ERR type=[np6,6-]> field </ERR> In the economic field.
Women used to stay at home, taking care of the children, cooking, washing and doing all <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> others </ERR> kinds of <ERR type=[fm2,-]> houseworking </ERR> They didn't go out for work to earn their own living.
" So, "negligible" is the only word <ERR type=[fm2,-]> occured </ERR> to them when women expressed their opinions and wills.
They encourage women <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> go </ERR> out to work, to be <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> independent </ERR> to men in finance so that they can be themselves since they do have to "take men's opinions too seriously.
Feminists fight against this not only because it is <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> economic inequality, but also because it is a social standing's inequality.
They are in opposition to the sex discrimination in work and insist that women must have the same wage with men <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> of </ERR> same job.
There are many other goals feminists fight for, such as seeking the political equality, preserving women from family violence and sexual <ERR type=[fm1,-]> harassement </ERR> in work <ERR type=[np6,2-]> place </ERR> against <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pornaghapha </ERR> and using women in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> advertisment </ERR> for example, just recently, some university students held the demonstration against "the Miss Hong Kong Contest", appealing for preserving women's dignity, stopping selecting beauty.
In conclusion, feminists play a very important role in improving women's status, they have done a great <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> deal </ERR> good to women, and will continue <ERR type=[wd3,1-2]> to </ERR> their jobs more efficiently.
In ancient China's moral codes, there were three virtue guides, among them was <ERR type=[np6,-2]> "Husband </ERR> guides <ERR type=[np6,2-]> wife </ERR> ".
In human's long history, women were <ERR type=[fm2,-]> undisputably </ERR> placed on a submissive and inferior position.
Concerning women's education, for example, many <ERR type=[fm2,-]> schoolaged </ERR> daughters of poor peasants are kept in the house, helping with the housework, in order to save money to sent their brothers to school.
Most college admissions officers admit that freshmen women enter with higher marks and better high school records than freshmen men, as if <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> because </ERR> only the best-prepared girls are encouraged to try for college.
Our institute as well as thousands of other universities and colleges in China <ERR type=[vp3,12-]> face </ERR> a big problem of assigning female graduates to working units.
More chances of promotion are given to men instead of their female <ERR type=[fm1,-]> colleages </ERR> who may have the same or even better ability of fitting the post.
Christine Craft, a Kansas TV anchor earned $38,500 a year, half of her male co-anchor's $75,000 <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> salary </ERR> Even so, her boss once said to her, "you are too old, too unattractive, and not sufficiently deferential to men".
Generally speaking, the society has a wrong <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> expect </ERR> of women, it <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> see </ERR> women as the genre dependent on men to make decisions both at home and at job, staying at home taking care of the family, sacrificing their creativity in <ERR type=[pp2,s-]> return </ERR> of marital harmony.
It also sets a <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> fix </ERR> standard of how a woman should be: it is not necessary for her to receive as much education as man, she doesn't have to work as hard either.
Women's liberation movement is the result of these <ERR type=[fm1,-]> injusice </ERR> and misunderstanding.
Its goal is to achieve women's public and political identities <ERR type=[fm1,-]> seperate </ERR> from that of their husbands, as well as their freedom to lead the kind of life of their own choice.
The two sexes should have equal chances in education, job and home decision, and they should <ERR type=[fm1,-]> coorperate </ERR> in all these aspects.
So, <ERR type=[wd3,-]> forward </ERR> women's lib!
During more than <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> of </ERR> a century of your struggle <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> history </ERR> great changes have taken place.
Laws of women protection are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> promogated </ERR> in countries all over the world.
While the most important of all <ERR type=[np3,s-s-]> woman </ERR> have gradually <ERR type=[vp9,3-]> stand </ERR> up and are ready to defend their legal rights.
However, any change can be bitter and hard to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> procede </ERR> So never stop, women's lib.
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Forward </ERR> to stop the unfairness!
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Forward </ERR> to free the men from the burden of supporting <ERR type=[np6,2-][wd7,s-]> psychic </ERR> as well as financial dependents!
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Forward </ERR> to give women true happiness to embrace their own <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> fate </ERR> !
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Forward </ERR> to achieve eternal human harmony between the two sexes!
<ERR type=[wd3,-]> Forward </ERR> women's lib!
That experience <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> are </ERR> now the exception rather than the rule.
By the end of the 1960s the women's movement had succeeded in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> challening </ERR> nearly all traditional cultural assumptions about women's proper place.
They challenge employment discrimination, bias against women in politics, and the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> antifemale </ERR> prejudice so dominant in the country's major economic and social institutions.
They also fight <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> for </ERR> repeal <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> for </ERR> of abortion laws, provide support for alternative life-styles, and, above all, raise the consciousness of women to the cultural bondage of being categorized as a sex object.
In America, though the administration of Ronald Reagan consistently adopted <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> positions </ERR> anathema <ERR type=[cc1,1-1]> of </ERR> feminists, the same administration appointed the first woman justice of the United States Supreme Court, named two women to the cabinet, and claimed to be more committed to women's rights than any previous administration.
<ERR type=[wd3,-3]> In </ERR> the influence of the movement, the quantity of women in employment has been increasing.
In the second place, massive changes had <ERR type=[fm2,-]> occured </ERR> in family life.
Because of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> faminists' </ERR> effort, the family violence is decreased sharply by public opinion.
Also because of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> faminists' </ERR> effort, informed by changing <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> attitudes </ERR> toward individual fulfillment, hundreds of thousands of young women have charted a new course for <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> themselves, </ERR> free of many of the constraints that in the past had assigned women to prescribed roles.
In the third place, the professional women appeal to stop the sexual <ERR type=[fm1,-]> harassement </ERR> in work place.
On the other hand, the <ERR type=[vp1,1-1]> prostituting </ERR> is <ERR type=[vp1,3-3]> publicized </ERR> an illegal thing to prevent the porn trade from developing in many countries.
In the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> forth </ERR> place, the women fight <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> for </ERR> repeal of abortion laws and the freedom of lesbian (of course, it is not suitable in China).
In the fifth place, <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> Many </ERR> women are <ERR type=[pp1,s-]> against </ERR> they are used as a model in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> advertisment </ERR> In fact, it is useful for the employers to improve their goods' quality.
If the employers <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> decrease </ERR> to use the models and improve the quality to attract the customers, it is a good thing for society.
Clearly, enormous changes have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> occured </ERR> both in the daily experience and in the cultural norms describing masculinity and femininity in society.
The changes appear almost revolutionary in <ERR type=[np6,6-]> dimension </ERR> But it <ERR type=[vp6,d]> was </ERR> too early to conclude that dramatic progress toward equality had <ERR type=[vp6,s-][cc2,s-]> taken </ERR> place.
Therefore, at last I appeal to everyone in society to <ERR type=[wd4,-]> participate </ERR> the feminist movement which <ERR type=[fm1,-]> heigtens </ERR> the women's positions.
(t9-6) One prominent and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> controvercial </ERR> campaign of this century is the feminist campaign.
The Feminists, with their awakening consciousness of the women's value and human dignity, call for the equality of women with men in terms of economy, <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> politic </ERR> social <ERR type=[np6,3-3]> role </ERR> and other aspects.
It comes <ERR type=[wd4,3-2]> into </ERR> <ERR type=[np4,-1]> feminists </ERR> mind that women have always been in a discriminated position <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> in </ERR> access to <ERR type=[np6,2-]> job </ERR> Firstly it's difficult for them to get a job.
Many companies would rather employ a man <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> even </ERR> his ability is much lower than the female applicant.
Secondly, if the women are finally employed, their <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> salary </ERR> are pretty lower than <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> her </ERR> male colleagues though they do the same kind of work.
Another <ERR type=[np1,1-3]> proposition </ERR> to protect women <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> from </ERR> the feminists is to curb the ill-treatment towards women.
In the world where <ERR type=[np3,-1]> male </ERR> dominate almost all the enterprises, women, as their subsidiaries are in a very <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> disadvantage </ERR> state.
It's rather frequent that <ERR type=[np3,s-]> female </ERR> suffer from the harassment from their bosses <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phisically </ERR> and spiritually.
Plenty of women stay at home, caring for the house and the children <ERR type=[cj1,s-]> while </ERR> financially <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> rely </ERR> on their husbands.
So, when they are battered by husbands, they are in very negative position for they have no financial support <ERR type=[wd3,3-2]> in </ERR> their back, so they may possibly <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> submitted </ERR> this, would reverse to worsen their situations.
The call for political <ERR type=[fm1,-]> equalty </ERR> is may <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> be </ERR> the most fundamental and significant one.
Women won their right for vote in the <ERR type=[wd7,2-1]> near </ERR> 1970s.
Today, they are <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> taking </ERR> more active part in more fields of the social life.
Some have taken up posts in government, and some even became the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> governmen </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,s-]> chief </ERR> like Mrs. Thather.
In my opinion, a large portion of the <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> feminists </ERR> propositions <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> are </ERR> sound and useful.
They serve as <ERR type=[np3,3-]> pioneer </ERR> and <ERR type=[np3,5-]> ice-breaker </ERR> <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> which </ERR> run on the first front in the battle against the unfair social convention.
And, as a <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> consequence, </ERR> will surely bring about the bright future for the women, even, the whole human society.
However, the feminists <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> are </ERR> also tend to be too radical in some aspects.
For <ERR type=[pp2,1-]> examples </ERR> some feminists tend to be hateful and inappropriately associate anything with the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> illtreatment </ERR> of women.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> Like </ERR> some suggest that all the words with "man", like "human, mankind," should have relevant <ERR type=[fm1,-]> "huwoman </ERR> womankind" in a way of equality.
Some suggest that women should be as hard and rough as men and that there should be no womanly <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> gentle </ERR> which is another kind of <ERR type=[np6,1-]> extreme </ERR> To sum up, feminists have contributed a great deal to the good of women.
Tribute should go to them except that they should be more objective and moderate on some <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> terms </ERR>
(t9-7) According to some reports of newspaper, nowadays, more and more Battered Women Shelters are established in the world, with the purpose to give some help to the women who have suffered bad <ERR type=[fm1,-]> treatmeat </ERR> of their husbands.
Though the slogan --- men and women are equal --- has been shouted for years, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> between men and women still exists <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> on </ERR> many aspects.
For example, the graduate <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> distribution </ERR> which has to be faced by most of the university students, has become a headache to girls.
Since many companies just prefer to accept males as their <ERR type=[np6,s-]> staffs </ERR> girls stand little chance for jobs.
Graduate <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> distribution </ERR> falls into the one in which only sex is important but not students' capacity or achievement.
This also provides a reason why boys' marks in their study are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> lower than girls in most universities.
[wd4,3-] even <ERR type=[wd4,5-]> PH.D, </ERR> in U.S. universities, have to leave their careers when they are married for they have to provide a good environment <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> for </ERR> husbands' study.
In order to change the unequal situation I suggest that <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> feminist </ERR> can do something like the <ERR type=[np6,1-]> followings </ERR> : Firstly, we can rely on the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> publicization </ERR> Since nowadays there are still quite a lot of people do not realize the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> disadvantage </ERR> condition that women are standing in, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> publicization </ERR> seems very important.
Feminists can give lectures to the public and <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> let </ERR> people aware of the existing <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> in addition, feminists can set up some schools for women, just to teach them how to protect themselves by the way of law, for a lot of women just accept their fates when they suffer bad treatment.
Secondly, feminists can urge the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> goverments </ERR> to set up some practical laws for women's rights.
Most companies, for <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> instant </ERR> do not want to accept females as their <ERR type=[np6,s-]> staffs </ERR> One reason I suggested is that they have to pay the salary to women who are going to bear children and could not work.
Thus, I think that the company of the husband and that of the wife can <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> share </ERR> to pay the salary.
If such laws really <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> put </ERR> into use, women's rights can <ERR type=[np7,-2]> make </ERR> great stride.
[cc2,s-] We are anxious to see any practical improvements for women's rights <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> are </ERR> coming soon.
(t9-8) <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Human </ERR> is divided into two parts: Man and <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> woman, </ERR> each plays an important role in this world.
Thus there <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> comes </ERR> women's liberation <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compaign </ERR> and Feminists, who struggle for the equality with men in the <ERR type=[cc1,-]> Man-chauvinism </ERR> world.
Even in China where others believe women are equal to men, things <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> actually not so ideal.
For example, when <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> enterprise goes <ERR type=[fm2,-]> headhiking </ERR> it would not hire you no matter how competent you are because you are a woman.
It would rather hire a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> men </ERR> less competent.
Such kind of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phenominon </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> are </ERR> not uncommon in China.
So we need a <ERR type=[fm1,-]> compaign </ERR> a reform urgently.
Yet the Feminists have done a lot: they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persued </ERR> equality with men in economy, in society and in politics; they protested against sexual <ERR type=[fm1,-]> harassement </ERR> in work place; they helped women who were victims of family violence; they opposed porn industries.
Perhaps, there exist some <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unproper </ERR> or overdone actions.
For instance, some Feminists <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> suggested </ERR> to change "history" into "herstory".
But <ERR type=[vp5,-s-]> comparing </ERR> to the good they have done, these <ERR type=[fm2,-]> overdones </ERR> are minor, and can be neglected.
Only <ERR type=[np3,s-]> man-chauvinist </ERR> considering their shaking position, will say bad words against Women's Liberation Movement.
The <ERR type=[np3,s-]> feminist </ERR> commenced their actions since the beginning of this century, in less than 100 years, the movement has influenced a fairly large part of the world.
They strive for their aim in almost every field of modern society: equality in economics, in politics and in social aspect; self-determination on matters <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> varied </ERR> from <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> sexual </ERR> to abortion and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> advertisment </ERR> Feminism does obtain <ERR type=[cc4,-1]> sweet </ERR> success in the fields as <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> was </ERR> stated above.
Special allowances also have been legally set for them; women's social estate has been greatly improved and their status in education, employment as well as in politics and economics <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> have </ERR> been greatly bettered.
Anyway, feminists in Britain and America, perhaps because of their <ERR type=[cc4,-2]> too </ERR> serious eagerness for their ideal, seemingly have gone to extremes in these years.
One of their famous demands is the legal and social acknowledgement for lesbian, even if this demand could be regarded as <ERR type=[fm2,-]> understoodable </ERR> how can people accept their calls of equality in Porn?
It's so ridiculous and absurd, no wonder that there are <ERR type=[np3,1-2]> someone </ERR> who say that feminists have done more harm, to the cause of women than good.
People can't help thinking whether <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> if </ERR> the feminism will change this which is called "man chauvinist" society to a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> "women </ERR> chauvinist" one?
In those areas, the voice of feminism is <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> weak </ERR> even soundless: Koran, the Bible of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lslum </ERR> rules the society <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> of </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lslum </ERR> world.
In countries such as lran, lraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, commandments and precepts on Koran direct people's thought and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> made </ERR> the society a complete <ERR type=[fm2,-]> man-absolution </ERR> one.
Those strict rules not only forbid women to involve in politics and economics, but also inhibit them from taking part in the usual social activities: Women are always <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> on </ERR> unemployment, women are not allowed to walk on street or show up in any public place without their black veils, women are not permitted to talk to strangers....
I wonder how's the feeling of the <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> women </ERR> there.
Have the conception of equality with men ever <ERR type=[vp9,8-]> came </ERR> into their mind?
Generally, East Asia is another region which the feminist should pay attention to (China is an exception, in this anciently <ERR type=[fm2,-]> historied </ERR> country, everything is under the doctrine of mean.
We haven't yet <ERR type=[vp9,3-]> find </ERR> any need for feminism presently).
Man-superiority has got deep roots in the society, man is the master both in and out of the home, man is responsible for all social <ERR type=[np5,-]> intercourses </ERR> man is the only back-bone of the family, man makes <ERR type=[wd3,1-5]> lives </ERR> for his wife and children.... while the woman is destined to play the role of wife to husband, mother to children and servant in the house; few chances are provided for women to develop their own career.
What target do those <ERR type=[np3,1-]> feminist </ERR> want to reach?
Perhaps, the first feminist's motive is <ERR type=[wd2,1-2]> pure </ERR> for <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> promoting </ERR> women to struggle for their social <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> statue </ERR> But, there is one important point which the first feminist neglected, that is, she and her followers did not give a definition for feminism, at least did not give a strict definition.
The feminists now just met the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unforturnate </ERR> condition.
I mean women can do as <ERR type=[ad2,2-]> good </ERR> as men, or better than men in some fields, but <ERR type=[wd4,s-2]> not </ERR> all fields.
In fact, feminists want to surpass men in every <ERR type=[np3,1-]> fields </ERR> they even want to place themselves over men.
This surely <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> caused </ERR> many serious problems, which are difficult to solve, even for those feminists.
It is very difficult to get same salary, same number of officials in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> govermental </ERR> institutions, because the women don't have enough ability, although they have enough energy.
Feminism is also one of the reasons <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> caused </ERR> family <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> violent </ERR> We know, most feminists are female.
In most cases, men give what they want to show their generosity, while in some <ERR type=[np3,2-]> family </ERR> the number of this kind of <ERR type=[np6,3-]> family </ERR> is not small, husbands can't stand the feminists' excessive demand.
Of course, it's not only the feminists' <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> thing </ERR> men also should be responsible for it.
Here, I just point out, feminism is one of the reasons <ERR type=[bp5,s-]> caused </ERR> family <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> violent </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> Furthermore, </ERR> sexual problem has been becoming more and more serious since the feminism appeared, such as, sexual <ERR type=[fm1,-]> harrasment </ERR> in work, porn, abortion, <ERR type=[fm1,4-2]> Ads </ERR> for women and its bad affection, homosexuality, etc.
Because I'm writing about feminism, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> so </ERR> I have to think that's some feminists go beyond their legal <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sope </ERR> and partly <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> caused </ERR> these problems.
Feminism now really <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> do </ERR> harm to women, except feminists give a strict definition to the term of feminism from now.
But <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> take </ERR> everything into consideration, one must consider men and women equal.
Nowadays, many things done by men are done also by women, which is, to some <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> extend </ERR> attributed to the feminists' struggle for the equality of women.
Women have now walked out of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kitch </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> Throughout </ERR> society, capable women are proving that they are valuable to the communities.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Morer </ERR> the husband must now assume some of the responsibilities of maintaining a household such as cooking, cleaning and other such job around the house.
Although China was once a deeply rooted feudal <ERR type=[fm1,-]> countrony </ERR> great changes of women's social position have taken place.
A <ERR type=[fm1,-]> numerber </ERR> of social trends are combining to produce a unique shift in family relationship.
In some big cities, an increasing number of two-parent families have a woman as the source of income as well as the husband, although some poor rural <ERR type=[cc2,-s-]> areas </ERR> are still <ERR type=[fm2,-]> prevailling </ERR> the traditional pattern of men working outside while women staying at home.
It is less <ERR type=[aj4,3-3]> embarrassed </ERR> about the situation that the father shoulders part of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> houshold </ERR> chores.
Secondly, when working, she'll meet with people from all walks of life and tackle various problems, even some hard ones, also she can learn a lot from her job, which will strengthen her will and <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> wider </ERR> her field of vision.
In conclusion, women's liberation raises women's social position and <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> cause </ERR> a variety of changes in interpersonal relationship within a family, which is good to women, but not does harm to women.
It is true that Chinese women can enjoy more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> priviledge </ERR> than women in the western society, but things are not always the case.
In characters, most Chinese <ERR type=[np3,2-]> character </ERR> with 'nu' (meaning women) as their <ERR type=[np6,s-]> components </ERR> mean evil qualities of mankind, such as 'greed' and 'wicked'.
Even <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Confusuis </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> blilliant </ERR> thinker and educator held that "women and villains are untrustworthy".
Shortly after liberation, over 90% of the female <ERR type=[np3,5-]> grown-up </ERR> were <ERR type=[fm1,-][np3,s-]> illeterate </ERR> or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> semi-illelerates </ERR> owing to the fact that only men can <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> learn </ERR> read and write in the old time because in the traditional concept only men can carry on the family name, they deserved all the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> privillege </ERR> in the society.
First of all, from central government to township faculty, "Women's <ERR type=[np3,1-1]> Federation </ERR> " are set up to deal with women problems specifically, such as family violence, women abuse, child abuse etc.
It is owing to this organization that China sees fewer problems with sex-discrimination than most <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Westen </ERR> countries.
It is also for this organization of this <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> organization </ERR> that the privilege and equality are trickling down to Chinese women.
There is also a slang to call the hen-pecked husband "Qi Guan Yan" <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> (literally </ERR> means <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tracheitis </ERR> while <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pronoucingly </ERR> similar to "wife controls tight").
If being called "Qi Guan Yan" means more respects are being paid to the wives in families why should the <ERR type=[np3,s-]> husbands </ERR> concern so much about his face, since a society, any society can not be regarded as a highly civilized one unless enough attention and respects are being paid to women.
Chinese success does not mean <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> it </ERR> has achieved enough to rest.
Actually, the more it achieves, the more it finds the <ERR type=[wd1,4-]> problems </ERR> Take the women in the better-off coastal cities in the south as an instance.
My <ERR type=[wd7,-s-]> women </ERR> taking the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> westen </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> patten </ERR> as a model, quit their jobs and reduce to housewives after their husbands have become <ERR type=[fm1,-]> millionairs </ERR> Some even regard it as a fashion to <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> wear </ERR> husband's surname <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> contrasting </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> westen </ERR> feminists are struggling for the women's <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> right </ERR> be called by their own names.
Hearing this question, most people may come to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> this </ERR> answer that a woman should be as busy as a bee in the kitchen, sweep the floor while telling the children's story and knit while humming the cradlesong.
These feminists are the <ERR type=[np3,4-]> champion </ERR> for the liberation of women from the yoke of chores.
But just as the common saying goes: "To be a woman is difficult <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> but </ERR> to be an independent woman is more difficult.
In the first place, since a woman <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> work </ERR> and is able to support herself, she becomes free to choose her marriage.
Unavoidably, they will blame each other for not supporting and understanding the other <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> party </ERR> The worse is the marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her career than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does.
Feminists have helped women shake off the traditional yoke of housework, but who will help them to lay down <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> to </ERR> heavy burden of double <ERR type=[np6,2-]> career </ERR> ?
Then when the society entered <ERR type=[wd5.-]> into </ERR> the patriarchal society, men took a leading role and this continues till now.
Yet ever since 70's, the movement of women liberation has been brought before people, particularly in the Western <ERR type=[np6,4-]> country </ERR> Feminists insist that women should be equal to men and women should go out to work in the society instead of staying at home taking care of the kids.
People <ERR type=[vp1,-4]> view </ERR> on this phenomenon differently.
Just staying at home looking after the kids, doing the house chores and serving the husband is not all that women can do, their wisdom and ability enable them to do much and more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> greater </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,5-]> thing </ERR> than these, of course those house <ERR type=[np3,2-]> work </ERR> are great too.
Maybe some people worry that if women take <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> jobs </ERR> , then it will do harm to the family and it may be too much for women to take a job as well as keep the house.
It's partly due to Chinese women's <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> hardworking </ERR> yet more important is that how people <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> view </ERR> on it.
If all the people are <ERR type=[pp1,s-]> for </ERR> a woman to have her own career and give her chance, such as the government <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> set </ERR> up <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> kindergarten </ERR> where the mother can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> sent </ERR> their kids <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> to </ERR> and then go to work at ease, and also the husband should have a hand in the house chores, then a woman can own a happy family and her own career at the same time.
If a woman just <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> stay </ERR> at home and <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> do </ERR> all the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> housechores </ERR> I'm sure she will get bored of it sooner or later.
While on the other hand, the husband goes home after a tiring day, and he <ERR type=[fm2,1-2]> maybe </ERR> too tired to talk to his wife too much about the work, to care about the housework and kids, and if he has any trouble in work he won't talk with her complaining wife for she can't understand him at all.
Yet if both the husband and wife have their career, and do the housework together, they will find it easier to communicate with each other and <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> feel </ERR> more like that they are in the same boat.
They can share their happiness and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> sorrowness </ERR> both in work and about family together.
Due to the division of labour, men and women should cooperate with each other for both of them have their own <ERR type=[fm1,-]> speciality </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,-4]> General </ERR> speaking, men are taking a leading role in the world, yet there are some fields that men can't take the place of women.
In the long history of human society evolution, women have been <ERR type=[fm1,-]> cosidered </ERR> to be inferior to men, except for <ERR type=[wd5,2-3]> in </ERR> the matrilineal commune.
Women had no position of their own whether inside or outside families, while men <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> justified to dominate the whole society.
They need not be the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> accesory </ERR> of men.
They must break <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> away </ERR> the traditional norms that women are not match for men.
The facts prove that women have contributed a great deal to the whole society since they are equal to men as a <ERR type=[np3,s-]> member </ERR> of the society.
They can act not only the part <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> of </ERR> daughter, wife and mother, but also the part <ERR type=[wd4,3-1]> of </ERR> secretary, teacher, minister, president and so on.
They have the ability to do a good job as long as the whole society will do away with the concept that women are <ERR type=[aj3,-]> stupider </ERR> or weaker than men.
When women walk out of the small limited circle, they will see a very broad world around <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> her </ERR> In this world, they will explore and develop their potential capability.
It undermines men's superiority and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> wons </ERR> their respect towards women.
Women are considered to be able to do only a few <ERR type=[np3,2-]> kind </ERR> of traditional jobs.
Women should have the ability to challenge other jobs, <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> especially </ERR> which <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> are </ERR> used to be men's, such as politician and scientists.
If women can't walk out their small circle and speak and act for themselves, they are more likely to be a <ERR type=[np3,7-]> loser </ERR> When children grow up, they leave their mother.
In such <ERR type=[np6,2-]> circumstance </ERR> women may take <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scrificication </ERR> into account.
As long as there are men and women <ERR type=[wd3,5-2]> in </ERR> the earth, they are equal.
(t9-16) A well-balanced nature, which used to be an Eden for humanity has no longer existed because humanity has regarded himself as the <ERR type=[np3,s-]> masters </ERR> of nature and has been excessively exploiting and utilizing natural resources without considering the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> consequnces </ERR> that will follow, let alone paying any attention to nature's calling.
In order to develop industries and build housing estate, mankind constantly cuts down trees at will, exploits <ERR type=[np6,1-]> prairie </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> primative </ERR> forest without <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> reconstruction </ERR> them, or even removes a whole hill for some aim.
For the purpose of chasing profits, they hunt and kill <ERR type=[cc4,-2]> immense </ERR> wild animals.
<ERR type=[fm2,-]> Worsely </ERR> people even destroy nature carelessly: deposit litter freely, release the waste even harmful residue and water into the rivers and discharge black poisonous smoke into the air.
Residents in some areas with river passing by will suffer from serious shortage of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> drink </ERR> water because the river has been aggravatingly <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pollutted </ERR> and covered with floating rubbish.
In the <ERR type=[np5,-]> countrysides </ERR> the placid pastoral life and tranquil environment have been damaged in line with the invasion of modern industries.
The fresh atmosphere has been <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pollutted </ERR> and the clean streams are covered by the waste residue and water.
Bad <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> hygiene </ERR> conditions are the commonly existing <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> components </ERR> in rural areas.
Soil erosion, desertification, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> salinisation-alkalinisation </ERR> and land degradation emerge, which also worsen the disasters like droughts and floods.
Besides, a tendency of increasing temperature and less rainfall <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> stem </ERR> from the destruction of massive grassland and forest, which also <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> cause </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> changable </ERR> climate.
It is estimated that in the future our <ERR type=[fm2,-]> decendents </ERR> can only <ERR type=[fm1,-]> appriciate </ERR> <ERR type=[fm2,-]> regretly </ERR> the beautiful rare wildlife like tiger and red-crowned crane in pictures because they are now becoming extinct.
People nowadays realize how wrong they have done to nature and begin to take <ERR type=[fm1,-]> pratical </ERR> actions to protect environment.
Measures are taken to stop the vicious cycle of exhaustion of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rescources </ERR> and the deterioration of the environment.
Mankind tries to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> remodify </ERR> and co-ordinate the relationship between humanity and nature by saving natural <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rescources </ERR> controlling birthrate, promoting moderate consumption, implementing overall adjustment and control and restoring the ecology.
A world-wide <ERR type=[fm1,-]> champaign </ERR> of environmental protection <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> popularizes </ERR> and more and more people join the issue.
People contrive and manufacture <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rescource-saving </ERR> products and search for clean energy source.
The concept of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envionmental </ERR> protection even roots in the young generation.
People consciously control their behaviours that may do harm to nature, <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> lessen </ERR> using <ERR type=[fm2,-]> plastical </ERR> bags or other products that may pollute <ERR type=[fm1,-]> envionment </ERR> Meanwhile, people reconstruct environment by afforestation and purifying water <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rescources </ERR> Some places which used to be garbage receptacles now become beautiful scenes.
Some large-scale banks and companies invest <ERR type=[np8,-1]> numerous </ERR> capital to save the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pollutted </ERR> rivers and scenery spots.
Nuclear-power stations have been built and put into use, replacing the conventional, heavily <ERR type=[fm2,-]> pollutted </ERR> coal-power station.
All these not only protect the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enviornment </ERR> but also beautify our survival surroundings for a better life.
(t9-17) I am not a feminist but I totally <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> approve </ERR> those actions taken by the feminists to protect women and to seek equal status with men, because in varying degrees, women in the world are in a lower position than men and treated unfairly.
For example, in China, girls are always at a disadvantageous position of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enrollement </ERR> for primary schools, middle-schools and even universities.
It's an undeniable fact that women's intelligence is commonly <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dispised </ERR> and ignored.
Imagine what a loss to human <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> being </ERR> if we couldn't have Mrs. Curie's great <ERR type=[fm1,-]> contibution </ERR> Women surely also have ability (if not equally great) to promote human development.
<ERR type=[np4,s-]> Feminists </ERR> fight for women' equal opportunity to gain education is <ERR type=[fm2,-]> undoubtably </ERR> wise and beneficial.
The girl graduates are always less <ERR type=[fm1,-]> populor </ERR> no matter how hard they have worked through all these years, no matter <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> how </ERR> good marks they have achieved, only because their opponents are boys who were born to have the merit endowed by <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> god </ERR> And women also have to struggle for equal payment for the same amount of work.
What on <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> earth </ERR> good does this social unfairness brings to <ERR type=[np6,s-]> human </ERR> ?
The whole <ERR type=[fm1,-]> draging </ERR> of human development?
These social <ERR type=[fm1,-]> phenomenons </ERR> often trouble me.
<ERR type=[wd4,s-]> But </ERR> women in some regions have more miserable fate even shock me vehemently.
In Islamic countries, women have to wear veils all the time and wear long <ERR type=[fm1,-]> rob </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,-]> letting </ERR> no part of body being seen by <ERR type=[np7,1-]> public </ERR> Women have no right to vote, to have their own profession, to take roles in the sports games.
It seems that in Islamic countries, women's <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> human </ERR> bodies are regarded as indecency.
While in some regions <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> of </ERR> Africa, a woman <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> to wear rings around <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> their </ERR> neck from a little <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> girl </ERR> and <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> add </ERR> rings every year so as to make the neck longer and longer.
When <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> human </ERR> is striking through all these centuries for development, this problem <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> became </ERR> more and more outstanding.
They have <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> gain </ERR> some rights for women through years
Thanks to the feminists who have taken the lead to break through the outmoded convention, the position of women <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nowadsys </ERR> has ranked almost <ERR type=[fm1,-]> paralell </ERR> to that of men.
Nowadays, women live much happier lives than those <ERR type=[wd5,-]> of </ERR> long ago.
They are respected and served by men in conventional circles where they <ERR type=[vp1,-3]> enjoy </ERR> together at conversation, games and amusements.
They are no longer left at home by their husbands to look after their children and their <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> in-laws </ERR> to manage the house chore.
If given more opportunities, they can do more <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> contribution </ERR> to the society.
Although nowadays that old custom has been <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> changed </ERR> lot, to some extent, it still has some negative effect.
At the present time, many women have become <ERR type=[fm2,-]> professionalists </ERR> A <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> with high standard of education occupies herself with a profession, however, most of the time she would work on an employment with a salary which does not match up to her knowledge and qualification.
And her children need her discipline and guidance to form good, healthy <ERR type=[fm1,-]> charater </ERR> But what about the woman herself, if a woman with qualification and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efficioncy </ERR> wouldn't be engaged in a profession, her knowledge acquired through several years of hard study would be wasted, I think it is unfair.
Under such circumstance, feminists <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> declaim </ERR> that women should be respected and be treated equally in every area.
They <ERR type=[wd4,-]> fight </ERR> equivalent <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> rights </ERR> for women.
I believe that in future women can <ERR type=[fm1,-]> aquire </ERR> rights that men have.
As time passed bit by bit, men came into power in a society little by little, and now in such an industrial society, it seems men are <ERR type=[np3,2-1]> dominator </ERR> in any <ERR type=[np6,1-]> fields </ERR> Thus feminism came into being in order to obtain equal rights with men.
Let's look at the following facts that will confirm my opinion that women, with the help of "feminists", are living in even <ERR type=[aj3,2-1]> poor </ERR> situation.
Well, such a woman should be both a capable housewife and an <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> energy </ERR> boss.
In a man-dominating <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> feminism </ERR> (I mean the idea or thought of that is <ERR type=[fm2,-]> controled </ERR> by men) movement, the situation can be easily interpreted as "she has traditional female virtue as well as modern ideas to be equal with men".
But in my opinion that cannot be called "equal" and is <ERR type=[vp9,1-2]> overbear </ERR> for women.
Another fact is that feminism <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> have </ERR> doubled the market of cigarette.
I don't think it is a good habit to smoke heavily, as we all know that smoking <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> do </ERR> a great <ERR type=[np5,2-]> harm </ERR> to our health.
Only <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> men </ERR> smoking is "bad" enough; women, demanding the same as men and joining <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> such </ERR> smoking trend, is <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> worse </ERR> .
I cite it only to prove that <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> it </ERR> unnecessary to equalize everything.
Now the error is that men <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> dominating the society.
Even some women <ERR type=[vp6,d]> regarded </ERR> themselves inferior to men and can't understand why feminists want to be equal with superior men.
The tradition has existed for a long time and is very forceful, But feminists' persistence has set a good example to women and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> encourges </ERR> them to be courageous and persistent.
Besides educating women, feminists have been leading them to show women's anger towards the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> in terms of strikes and demonstration, which have been very forceful and effective.
Lots of women have come out of their kitchens and have jobs in many fields such as politics, <ERR type=[wd2,3-3]> financial </ERR> sports and even astronomy which were dominated by men before.
We should not forget that feminists have brought <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benifit </ERR> to not only the cause of women, but also the cause of men.
Women are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,4-1]> with </ERR> men, which results in better communication.
Now female political leaders are not a rare thing as we see <ERR type=[wd4,3-3]> that </ERR> former British prime minister <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Tharcher </ERR> is a well-known woman politician.
Some <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> people' </ERR> belief that politics belongs to men is no longer accepted by both men and women since many facts have proved this belief wrong.
For example, <ERR type=[wd3,-s-]> teacher </ERR> seems to be one of the favourite professions for women.
(t9-2) As the <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> social </ERR> develops Feminism becomes one of the social phenomena.
What the feminists advocate is to improve the women's social status, make the women <ERR type=[vp4,3-4]> release </ERR> from the heavy housework and make the women have an equal opportunity to go to <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> social </ERR> with man, and so on.
In a word, feminists think the men and the women <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> is </ERR> equal.
On the one hand, the phenomena <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> reflect </ERR> that <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thoughs </ERR> of the women has been <ERR type=[vp9,2-][vp1,2-2]> liberate </ERR> more <ERR type=[ad3,1-][fm2,-]> furtherly </ERR> than before.
On the other hand, the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> thoughs </ERR> has done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> anciet </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,2-3]> the </ERR> women were <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> consider </ERR> as the humble <ERR type=[np6,s-]> classes </ERR> and machine of giving birth to children, <ERR type=[np7,s-]> the </ERR> women <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> inferior to men.
For example the women were prevented from taking part in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> anciet </ERR> Olympic Sports.
Now <ERR type=[np7,s-s-]> the </ERR> women become an essential part of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> social </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,s-1]> The </ERR> women not only can <ERR type=[vp2,-2]> take </ERR> part of the social action concerning political, <ERR type=[wd4,-3]> economic, </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,-2]> culture's </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,1-]> field </ERR> the <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> women </ERR> but also can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> became </ERR> managers, drivers, teachers, and so on.
At present, <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> social </ERR> can't provide equal opportunity of <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> employ </ERR> <ERR type=[vp2,5-5]> with </ERR> <ERR type=[np7,-]> the </ERR> men to <ERR type=[np7,-]> the </ERR> women in a certain <ERR type=[fm1,-][wd2,-1]> captimism's </ERR> country.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Nevthless </ERR> the phenomena are less.
While the completely <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> equal </ERR> between the men and the women is out of the question First, the physical <ERR type=[fm1,-]> differnce </ERR> is <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> existence </ERR> On <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> a </ERR> whole <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> men are strong, <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> women are weak, which lead the men to become the embodiment of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strenghth </ERR> and make the men be equal to the heavy physical <ERR type=[cc1,8-]> work </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nevthless </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> women can't do it.
Secondly <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wen </ERR> usually are <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> bravery </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd2n3-]> confidence </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> women are tender and <ERR type=[wd2,4-]> cautions </ERR> The <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> characterises </ERR> of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wen </ERR> make the men be prone to work in the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> social </ERR> and the women stay at home to look after the children.
If the men tend <ERR type=[wd3,1-4]> for </ERR> the child other than the women.
Which <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> neither </ERR> embodies the advantage of the men nor embodies the advantage of the women.
[wd7,s-] In a word, the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> distinguish </ERR> between the men and the women in social <ERR type=[np6,2-l]> act </ERR> is only <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> social's </ERR> <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> difference </ERR> distribution rather than <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> discriminate </ERR> the women.
To some extent, the opinion which feminists <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> emphasis </ERR> on is at the cost of the women's health.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Beause </ERR> the women's power is <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> limit </ERR> in contrast with the men's power For example, the <ERR type=[np4,1-2]> women </ERR> <ERR type=[np4,2-1]> world's </ERR> champion of <ERR type=[fm2,-]> runing </ERR> 100m <ERR type=[vp9,-]> must </ERR> ran more <ERR type=[ad3,-]> slowly </ERR> than the men's world champion.
If people consider <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> wen </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> women as the same as feminists describe, <ERR type=[wd5,-1]> the </ERR> women will undertake <ERR type=[wd5,-3][cc3,1-2]> the </ERR> more impression from the <ERR type=[wd2,2-1]> social </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm2,-]> theirself </ERR> It will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enfluence </ERR> the women's health in a long <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> term, </ERR> what is more, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> minize </ERR> the men's effect on the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> faimly </ERR> and the <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> social </ERR> It is against what the feminists wish.
Therefore, the view of feminists <ERR type=[vp9,4-1]> isn't </ERR> deserve standing absolutely.
<ERR type=[ad1,s-]> About </ERR> in the 1970's, feminists turn <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> up </ERR> in the advanced western countries.
But contrary to our common sense, feminists were usually male <ERR type=[wd3,4-2]> other </ERR> than female.
Feminists initiated the women movement to fight <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> up </ERR> against those old-fashioned traditional concepts, and appealed to the society for men and women's equality.
In the <ERR type=[wd4,3-]> first </ERR> social division of labour is different, and men and women have different ability.
Many kinds of jobs, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> especialy </ERR> those jobs which need strength, don't suit <ERR type=[vp2,1-]> to </ERR> women.
Although the society is advancing rapidly, many jobs tend to need wisdom other than strength, we still think so, for men and women have <ERR type=[wd3,-]> distinguishing </ERR> physiological characteristics.
Women are superior at imagination, language, memory and feelings, but men are good at <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mathatics </ERR> physics, operation, and so on.
If we could let men and women engage <ERR type=[vp1,1-6]> in </ERR> what jobs most suit to each other, this kind of rational division of labour would do good to the social advancement.
In the <ERR type=[wd4,3-]> second </ERR> the name of women is <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> titled </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,6-2]> by </ERR> 'the weak'.
Women are like <ERR type=[np6,3-]> bird </ERR> but men are like <ERR type=[np6,3-]> tree </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,-2]> Bird </ERR> should hide <ERR type=[wd3,-4]> under </ERR> the shade of <ERR type=[np6,1-2]> tree </ERR> to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> avoide </ERR> the strong sunlight.
Feminists' opinions encourage women to compare with <ERR type=[vp1,2-5]> men </ERR> in all sorts of ways.
We often run across such <ERR type=[np6,1-]> situation </ERR> : a woman possesses money and success of <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> enterprise </ERR> but <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> in </ERR> the same time loses her feminine qualities and doesn't look lovely as before.
She gets married late, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> and </ERR> even becomes a spinster.
In essence, feminism is the <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> mainly </ERR> reason for such tragedy.
In their opinions, women don't need to rely on men, women can earn enough money to support <ERR type=[fm2,-]> themself </ERR> women should work hard at their work, women can become <ERR type=[np6,3-]> manager </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> scientist </ERR> and even <ERR type=[np6,s-]> president </ERR> We couldn't say the view is wrong, but women's cause also <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> include </ERR> helping men with their enterprises, bringing up children.
It is women's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> responsibity </ERR> to bring birth a new <ERR type=[cc3,4-]> life </ERR> to the world.
If all the women gave up <ERR type=[fm1,-]> houswork </ERR> to climb along the career ladder, what would happen to the world?
The family would break up frequently, divorce should happen, and the society would be unstable, then women couldn't get truly liberated When God makes man and woman, he expects them to help each other rather than fight <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> up </ERR> against each other.
(t9-4) In most countries, <ERR type=[np6,-2]> feminist </ERR> have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strugled </ERR> for the right for many years.
Today, many women are going into professions, such as medicine, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> low </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> engineering </ERR> even <ERR type=[cc1,4-]> police </ERR> They comprise a large part of the workers in business and factories, and, in addition, they are working up to important jobs which used to be held predominantly by men.
There <ERR type=[vp3,-3]> are </ERR> even some business which <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> are </ERR> run completely by women in some countries.
But these have <ERR type=[fm2,-][wd3,s-]> rised </ERR> the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> satues </ERR> of women indeed?
In plain terms, women such as <ERR type=[fm3,3-][cc1,3-]> china </ERR> work hard.
<ERR type=[fm3,-s-]> and </ERR> for the most part, they <ERR type=[wd5,1-3]> are </ERR> get equal pay for equal work.
Because <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> women </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> prodominant </ERR> in the low-paying fields, they receive, actually, less money than <ERR type=[np6,6-]> man </ERR> In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to positions of leadership even in professions they <ERR type=[wd2,1-3]> dominant </ERR> in some countries, such as Russia.
Although men comprise only 15 percent of <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> all </ERR> people involved in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> helth </ERR> care, <ERR type=[wd3,-s]> they </ERR> are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervisors, and administrators.
Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> management </ERR> <ERR type=[fm3,-s-]> in </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> addition, <ERR type=[np6,-1]> feminist </ERR> is not to relieve the burden of women, on the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> countrary </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inurese </ERR> it.
Although women enter professions, they should do nearly all the housework in plain <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> minds </ERR> They are not only earning the money, but also watching the children washing.
They have to prepare dinner, have to wash the plates and <ERR type=[wd4,-]> so </ERR> .
So we can say <ERR type=[fm1,-][np6,-1]> "faminist </ERR> have done more harm to the cause of women than good".
(t9-5) On account of history, some western countries such as America, England, and Iceland, have always an advanced culture in <ERR type=[wd2,1-][wd7,s-]> physically </ERR> It makes a good chance for women in these countries to have a good education.
The women in these countries always lead a life <ERR type=[wd1,2-]> comfortable </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd2,5-]> wealth </ERR> In <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> physically </ERR> they have almost <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> melt </ERR> Good education makes them have an intensive <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> self-sense </ERR> In some respects, they appeal for personality <ERR type=[fm1,-]> libration </ERR> strongly.
But <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> whatever </ERR> the <ERR type=[np3,s-1]> woman </ERR> work <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> hard </ERR> at their cause, they always have <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> run </ERR> up against a few serious roadblocks in their successful <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> road </ERR> In practice, women often find it difficult to rise <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> to </ERR> position of leadership in professions they dominate.
At last, in order to obtain their rights, they <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> have a feminist.
Although they have many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> reason </ERR> to do this, in general, in my view, <ERR type=[np6,-1]> feminist </ERR> have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.
Though this is the world that man is <ERR type=[fm1,-]> advantagous </ERR> over women, in general, the society still <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> advocate </ERR> equality between man and woman.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> socity </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> given several "the lady first" conditions for women because <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> of </ERR> differences both man and woman.
<ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> But </ERR> feminist <ERR type=[fm1,-]> emplisises </ERR> woman's right too much.
I think it is <ERR type=[wd4,-]> extreme </ERR> Let's suppose, once the feminist would <ERR type=[wd2,1-]> success </ERR> The <ERR type=[np3,s-1]> woman </ERR> have full rights to let <ERR type=[np3,s-]> man </ERR> <ERR type=[vp2,2-2]> serve </ERR> for them.
The men hate <ERR type=[np3,3-]> woman </ERR> and don't help them.
It <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> will </ERR> more harm to the cause of <ERR type=[np3,s-]> woman </ERR> than good.
This is one <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> hand </ERR> On the other hand There are great differences in physiology between man and woman.
For the woman, they are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> fit </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> for </ERR> family than <ERR type=[wd3,s-][wd4,-2]> woman </ERR> Feminist <ERR type=[fm1,-]> over-emphsises </ERR> woman's political rights, and ignores <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> act's </ERR> in their family.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sociaty </ERR> would be out of order.
The woman couldn't go in for their cause with soul and <ERR type=[wd1,3-]> heart </ERR> This would be great harm to women's cause.
In conclusion, <ERR type=[np6,-1]> feminist </ERR> have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.
(t9-6) Some people <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> mind </ERR> that the women's movement has brought <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> about </ERR> <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> the </ERR> women more <ERR type=[fm2,-]> harmness </ERR> than <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> goodness </ERR> but I think, the women's movement <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> do </ERR> to the women more good than harm.
Before the women's movement women were considered following cultural tradition to be the best or most "natural" parents and were <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> given </ERR> custody of the children.
The leaders <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> of </ERR> movement are mainly college-educated women.
In few <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> short </ERR> years, they caused American society to start reexamining itself, influenced the government to pass antidiscrimination <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lows </ERR> in hiring and increased their <ERR type=[wd7,2-]> following </ERR> Women's liberation is surely to take place.
The most practical goals of the movement <ERR type=[vp6,s-s-]> were </ERR> to gain job equalities in pay and promotions, because people seem to feel that women's work is inherently unequal to men's.
For women can <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> being </ERR> <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> free </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,s-1]> for </ERR> work outside the home, the women's movement has called for more child-care centres.
These changes in the family life-styles would more <ERR type=[ad3,1-]> equally </ERR> socialize boys and girls and would decrease sex-role difference.
But the fact is, more and more women <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> worked </ERR> and the working wives are much more optimistic about job roles.
The second is that women working outside the home are less likely to have happy, stable marriages than housewives, this means that <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> her </ERR> job has a bad effect on <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> her </ERR> marriage.
On the other hand, because the leaders of the movement don't know well the condition of <ERR type=[cc4,1-1]> low-educated </ERR> women, their actions sometimes are not <ERR type=[wd2,2-2]> practically </ERR> and unreasonable, sometimes they go too far <ERR type=[wd4,2-3]> away </ERR> the practical life, <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> those </ERR> bring the women <ERR type=[fm2,-]> harmness </ERR> But <ERR type=[wd7,d]> those </ERR> are not <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> mainly </ERR> On the whole, the women's movement <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> bring </ERR> the equality to the women.
So I <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> mind </ERR> the Feminists have done more good to the women than harm.
Feminists <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> has </ERR> grown <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> rapid </ERR> these years.
In fact, I think the men and women should be equal in position of society, in human rights and personality, also in <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> equal </ERR> paying for equal job.
But the leaders of feminists <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> emphasis </ERR> these too much.
They think women should rise to positions of leadership in every <ERR type=[np6,1-]> areas </ERR> even in some <ERR type=[pr5,s-]> what </ERR> they couldn't do well.
As <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> a </ERR> women, they have their own characters different from men They do things carefully, they are warm-hearted, but they have limited physical and mental vitality.
Some <ERR type=[np5,s-]> works </ERR> are fit for them to do and others not.
They couldn't have much time and energy to do heavy work, <ERR type=[fm2,1-][wd4,2-4]> nomatter </ERR> in physical or in mental vitality.
You can find those women insisting on <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> feminists </ERR> always end the day mentally and physically exhausted.
Being an ordinary <ERR type=[np3,s-]> person </ERR> they could also do things which they care for in their spare time.
(t9-8) Feminists have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> strugled </ERR> for women's right in <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> most countries for many years, and it has brought some right which only men <ERR type=[vp6,-2]> can </ERR> have before, for example, the women in <ERR type=[wd5,1-2]> the </ERR> many countries can do the same job as men, go to school and enter politics.
Do these <ERR type=[vp1,-6]> make </ERR> the situation of women to <ERR type=[cc3,5-]> rise </ERR> indeed?
As we know, women hadn't been <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> allowed </ERR> to work for <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> few </ERR> thousands of years, such as <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> china </ERR> in which the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fedlism </ERR> has more than 2000 years of history, the <ERR type=[np6,s-]> concept </ERR> which Kongzi and Mengzi established have <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> posses </ERR> the main situation in many people's <ERR type=[cc1,4-]> brain </ERR> In <ERR type=[pr3,-1]> that </ERR> days, <ERR type=[pr4,s-][pr1,s-s-]> me </ERR> held the seat of <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> power </ERR> Women <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> was </ERR> <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> thought </ERR> that they could only stay at home and do housework,they must be ruled by men.
It would be normal <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> of </ERR> a man <ERR type=[fm2,-]> hitted </ERR> a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> but conversely, if a man was <ERR type=[fm2,-]> striked </ERR> by a <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> that <ERR type=[np3,1-]> women </ERR> would be denounced, even punished.
Although it is known by every <ERR type=[cc4,1-]> people </ERR> that <ERR type=[wd5,1-4]> the </ERR> <ERR type=[np3,-2]> man </ERR> and women <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> is </ERR> equal, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> furtherly </ERR> ensured by law <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> but </ERR> the traditional concept is very difficult to be changed <ERR type=[fm1,-]> competely </ERR> and rapidly.
Some women in the professions consider working an honor and a privilege, but they don't <ERR type=[fm1,-]> abtain </ERR> the same right as men, although they can enter <ERR type=[fm1,-]> proffessions </ERR> such as medicine, architecture, and teacher they couldn't rise <ERR type=[wd4,2-4]> to </ERR> position of prestige more easily.
In practice, it is very difficult, even in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> proffessions </ERR> they dominate.
In the <ERR type=[fm3,2-1]> soviet </ERR> Union, although men comprise only 15 percent of all people involved in health care, <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> they </ERR> are 50 percent of the medical directors, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> supervistors </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ministrators </ERR> Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> magagement </ERR> And, although most factory <ERR type=[np3,2-l]> worker </ERR> are women, the foreman would likely be a man.
In <ERR type=[pp2,1-1]> the </ERR> addition, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Femisnits </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> is </ERR> not to relieve the burden of women, but to increase it.
for the women <ERR type=[vp4,s-s-]> entering </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> proffessions </ERR> they not only <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> watches </ERR> the children, but also do cooking, washing.
<ERR type=[fm3,s-]> they </ERR> are often involved in many trifles of their family.
After the working is over, men may go home and have a rest, but <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> they </ERR> can't.
<ERR type=[fm3,s-]> they </ERR> have to prepare dinner for <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> her </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> familsies' </ERR> and they must get <ERR type=[vp2,1-]> to </ERR> earlier than their husband for breakfast.
According to these, the situation of the women hasn't <ERR type=[cc1,6-]> risen </ERR> indeed, and we expect that condition of the women's could be improved in the future.
The programme of action involves items concerning women's vital interests such as: sharing rights at different levels, participating equally in making political and economic decisions, enjoying equal pay for equal work <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> to </ERR> male workers, women's education and health care, elimination of violence towards women.
<ERR type=[wd5,s-]> etc </ERR> The representatives pointed out that the World Women's Conference should be coordinated with the World Conference of Human Rights and the World Population and Development meeting which are to be held within two years.
Women's problems can be taken seriously enough and particularly <ERR type=[cc2,s-]> undertaken </ERR> only when they are brought into other important international conferences.
Many deputies emphasized the importance for women to participate in various fields' decision: women must become fully equal citizens, <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> taking </ERR> active part in lives of all <ERR type=[wd1,4-]> walk </ERR> and take responsibility for their society's and the world's future.
Deputies from developing countries universally placed emphasis <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> on </ERR> urgency of solving these problems: women's poverty, education and health care, especially for peasant women, old women, disabled women and women migrants and refugees.
While women refugees suffering from chaos by wars are more likely to <ERR type=[vp1,-1]> fall </ERR> victim.
Since the whole world <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> become </ERR> more and more serious on the issue of women's position.
Therefore, all the newly-born babies seem to be equal to each other, but their futures are heavily influenced by their individual family background, social background and one's personal <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efferts </ERR> that is the reason why some of them are more likely to have <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opptunities </ERR> than others, and they are easy to reach their goals.
With or without great personal <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efferts </ERR> which is the implication of George Orwell's statement --- "Some are more equal than others.
" When a baby first comes to this world, he/she knows nothing about our world, but something <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> destine </ERR> will happen to him/her so that he cannot avoid them even though he/she wants to change them.
For <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> example, </ERR> complexion is a character of a nation, people with different complexions should be equal as they are all live creatures created by <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> the </ERR> God, but things are not always as what we <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> had </ERR> imagined.
<ERR type=[fm3,s-]> there </ERR> is still a long distance between the real society and the ideal model of the laws.
Even in the same country, people with the same complexion also differ a lot in acquiring <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opptunities </ERR> and carrying out their rights.
On the other hand, family background plays an important role in one's realization of <ERR type=[cc1,2-]> ego </ERR> For example, every university graduate should be equal, then equal <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opptunities </ERR> can be awarded to them to get a commonly desired job, but in fact, those who have better family background are more likely to get the job no matter whether they are more capable or not than others, which is one of the phenomena metioned by George Orwell --- Some are more equal than others.
But the most important factor in one's life is one's personal striving and struggling, which makes him/her "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal" </ERR> than others no matter what social and family background he/she has.
Obviously, the process of reaching the destination requires more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efferts </ERR> and endurance, maybe, those who have no family background will fail several times more than those who have in the whole <ERR type=[wd7,-]> process </ERR> they should endure the failures and never be disappointed to realize their <ERR type=[fm2,-][cc3,2-]> egoes </ERR> With those great <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efferts </ERR> their futures are promising.
Once they succeed, they will be given more <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opptunities </ERR> as we always give more to those who have much and take away from those who have <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> little </ERR> thus their <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> prevails </ERR> over others will remain and <ERR type=[vp1,-2]> affect </ERR> a lot for a long time.
Then, they are "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal" </ERR> than others.
So, everyone should struggle <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> from </ERR> him/herself, especially <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> for </ERR> those without good family background.
Only with striving and great <ERR type=[fm1,-]> efferts </ERR> can we make ourselves "more" equal to others.
I think feminists have done good to women themselves <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> and </ERR> society, to some <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> extend </ERR> to family and children.
They were men's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> accessorise </ERR> First they must abide by their fathers; then be faithful to their husbands.
Especially in feudal China, women smiled with <ERR type=[fm2,-]> mouthes </ERR> closed; they never dare to go out of their houses alone.
So slave and feudal societies were backward and poor, while <ERR type=[wd2,-3]> capital </ERR> and <ERR type=[wd3,-1]> social </ERR> societies developed very quickly.
To some <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> extend </ERR> it's due to women's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> emacipation </ERR> Some jobs do need to be done by women.
<ERR type=[np6,s-]> Fact </ERR> proves that women not <ERR type=[wd1,s-]> only </ERR> can do it, but also can do it well.
<ERR type=[ad2,s-]> Especially </ERR> Chinese female athletes win more honor for their motherland.
Why can't fathers and mothers take care of <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> Children </ERR> together?
Meanwhile double income will make <ERR type=[np6,2-3]> family </ERR> live a rich, happy and comfortable life.
I think women's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> emacipation </ERR> is unavoidable.
Someone says: "Feminism <ERR type=[vp3,1-1]> do </ERR> more harm to the society than good", which I don't fully agree to.
Only <ERR type=[pr4,s-]> themselves </ERR> are important.
Some other women feel <ERR type=[pp1,1-5]> like </ERR> that their life is complete only when they are at men's side.
I don't understand why some people say that feminism <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> do </ERR> more harm to the society than good.
This is the reason <ERR type=[pr51-]> that </ERR> some people say that feminism <ERR type=[vp3,2-3]> do </ERR> more harm to the society than good.
In history, or rather his story, man <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tyies </ERR> to put forward a satisfactory answer One incarnation of woman, in man's eyes, may be Pandora, who was a union of beauty and evil, stupidity and temptation.
She opened the forbidden box and brought <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> plaques </ERR> and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unhapiness </ERR> to mankind.
In order to control the dangerous opposite sex, <ERR type=[np6,s-]> man </ERR> either grabs a whip as what Nicher said, or convinces <ERR type=[np6,s-]> woman </ERR> that as a rib of the Adams, she is intellectually inferior and physically weaker.
They believe that women are individuals as men, they should have roles <ERR type=[fm1,-]> separet </ERR> from those of wife and mother as men do.
One of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, even boldly attacked what she called the male <ERR type=[np2,-1]> bias </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,3-1]> of </ERR> Bible, and published her " Women's Bible".
Surely such radical ideas as well as the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> extrem </ERR> language would be hotly debated.
That is why some people <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stronly </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-][vp1,-s-]> critisized </ERR> that feminism has done <ERR type=[aj3,2-2]> great </ERR> harm than good to the cause of women.
Believe it or not, it is a fact that girls this day are much more happier and freer than their mother or grandmother, although they still confront some problems such as less <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oppertunities </ERR> of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> employement </ERR> than boys, smaller pay and limited scale of career, and abortion etc.
When women realized maternity, the biological role of them has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> troditionally </ERR> been regarded as their major social role, and the law written by men who were <ERR type=[fm1,-]> stongly </ERR> influenced by that stereotype turned out <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unfaveralb </ERR> and unequal to them, they began to fight for vote and for the chances to be legislators.
After a long period of struggle, in June 1919, U.S. Congress finally passed the women's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> suffage </ERR> bill and the 19th Amendment to the constitution became law on Aug.26 1920.
Some 25 million women in U.S. <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> had </ERR> won the right to vote.
[wd4,-3] Same victory <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> had </ERR> been gained in Great Britain and other parts of <ERR type=[wd5,2-1]> the </ERR> Europe later.
In China, the New Cultural <ERR type=[fm3,s-]> movement </ERR> also brought a sort of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> emacipation </ERR> to women.
In 1966, Betty Eridan, the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> auther </ERR> of the famous "Feminine Mystique" organized the National Organization for Women ( NOW )in U.S., it agitated for such improvements as child-care for professional women who wanted to work.
They also <ERR type=[fm1,-]> lectuered </ERR> lobbied in congress, and filed legal suits against sex discrimination.
For example, does the equality means the end of the <ERR type=[wd6,1-]> the </ERR> family and home?
Is it possible for women and <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> men </ERR> live in peace?
" There is <ERR type=[np7,-1]> a </ERR> old <ERR type=[fm3,2-1]> chinese </ERR> saying, which goes like "more and less are equally bad", it is quite important for <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> feminists </ERR> pay much attention to the limit of their efforts.
In my opinion, it is insensible to hold such an attitude, as we can conclude from the analysis of the present conditions of the <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> feminism </ERR> movement.
As we all know, through the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persistant </ERR> struggling of all these years, feminism has <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alrealy </ERR> gone a long way towards success.
Women begin to <ERR type=[vp2,1-2]> cut </ERR> smart figures in all fields.
There are more and more successful <ERR type=[np3,-1]> woman </ERR> scientists, artists, journalists, and even <ERR type=[fm2,-]> politists </ERR> in recent years.
For example, in the past, women in many countries were forbidden to take activities which made them appear in public, especially in <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> muslim </ERR> countries.
But now, even in these <ERR type=[fm3,1-1]> muslim </ERR> countries, there are several <ERR type=[np3,-2]> woman </ERR> political leaders, and they are doing a good job.
However, in today's China, people feel natural if they know that <ERR type=[np9,-1]> some </ERR> woman divorces her husband because it is well-known that women have already had the right to choose their companion.
In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Turky </ERR> where women were always forbidden to show any part of their body except eyes in public <ERR type=[wd5,2-]> occasions </ERR> women are adopting some western <ERR type=[fm1,-]> custume </ERR> to beautify themselves.
Whenever new-born things <ERR type=[fm1,-]> mad </ERR> their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> appearences </ERR> there is always great pain.
Women have to deal with a series of new problems as soon as they get their <ERR type=[fm2,-]> long-aspired </ERR> freedom and rights.
They now have their right to work, but at the same time the privilege of women <ERR type=[vp3,3-2]> are </ERR> also deprived of.
In the past, women <ERR type=[vp6,3-]> enjoy </ERR> much convenience when having <ERR type=[np6,1-]> child </ERR> Nowadays, women are <ERR type=[vp1,s-][vp7,-]> given </ERR> to know that they must take responsibility as man <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> do </ERR> Thus their maternity leave becomes as short as possible.
<ERR type=[wd4,s-]> In </ERR> society, they are not in a position to be protected and taken care of by men, but they have to take care of themselves now.
They are the troubles whose <ERR type=[fm2,-]> solvement </ERR> will lead to success, because the essence of feminism is perfectly correct.
Through this movement, human beings will make <ERR type=[np7,1-1]> a </ERR> important step towards equality.
Regarding long-term happiness, we will <ERR type=[fm1,-]> undoutedly </ERR> choose feminists as our pioneers to make <ERR type=[fm1,-]> benifit </ERR> for women and for human beings.
First, feminists appeal for <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eqality </ERR> between man and woman, ignoring social divisions.
But many are in nature the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> speciality </ERR> of women.
But feminists have the prejudice <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> that </ERR> society offers unequal chance and right for man and <ERR type=[pp1,3-]> woman </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> namely </ERR> society favours man instead of woman.
What's more, women tend to have advantage over <ERR type=[np6,6-]> man </ERR> Maybe in the future man will launch a movement of man's emancipation.
It will do nothing good <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> to </ERR> society but to <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> waste </ERR> time and money.
(t10-1) Two hundred years ago, some distinguished people brought forth on the North American continent, a new nation, <ERR type=[cc3,-3]> dedicated </ERR> to the proposition that all men are created equal.
In a sense, we might say that, all men are equal, but some are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Because we belong to the same species, we <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> are </ERR> same, we are equal.
All of us live on the earth and <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> shone </ERR> by the sun.
For a long time, black people served as slaves while white people who <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> are </ERR> slave-owners enjoyed wealth without working.
For a long time, women were <ERR type=[vp9,2-][vp1,2-5]> deprive </ERR> the right of being educated, and, in some Arabian countries, they were forced to cover their face with veil when going out.
According to the law, diplomats, who <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp6,s-s-]> was </ERR> convicted of murder in <ERR type=[np7,s-2]> the </ERR> foreign country, are free from punishment.
There can be no doubt that, some people are really more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
The attractive goal of equality <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> have </ERR> not yet been achieved.
Because he <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> is </ERR> president, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> and </ERR> he is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than you.
<ERR type=[fm1,-]> Beause </ERR> he <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> is </ERR> president, he can exercise a power of veto of the decrees while you can just obey.
In the United States, only those who are backed up by <ERR type=[fm1,-]> millionares </ERR> could probably be elected as the <ERR type=[np3,s-]> candidate </ERR> for <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> president </ERR> So men of means are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than you.
At present, <ERR type=[fm3,-]> negroes </ERR> in South Africa and some other places still <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> suffered </ERR> from discrimination and segregation.
In America, citizens of <ERR type=[np5,2-]> colors </ERR> tend to have less <ERR type=[fm1,-]> oportunity </ERR> of accessing the higher social class.
Because they are judged by their color of skin but not their <ERR type=[wd7,d]> content </ERR> In conclusion, in a sense all men are equal.
But in fact, some are really more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
There are always some who are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
The customs knew, but did not <ERR type=[wd3,-]> check </ERR> them.
Because they had power plus money, they were more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
The smugglers met less trouble by securing the power <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> protection </ERR> .
He can never hope to possess that enormous <ERR type=[np3,s-]> sums </ERR> of money to run the presidential election.
He is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than those who have not.
The <ERR type=[aj1,-s-]> most </ERR> they get is to be expelled.
They are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others before the law.
Those clever animals, or somebody else, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> creat </ERR> the usage --- more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal, </ERR> knowing that they are smearing the innocent word.
[aj3,1-] But now I know more.
(the "more" here is not the "more" in "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal" </ERR> <ERR type=[pr1,-]> ) </ERR> It reminds me of somebody, or to be <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> exactly </ERR> some country.
Before it got independence, freedom and equality, it exclaimed to the whole world that it would struggle for <ERR type=[pr1,s-s-]> them </ERR> at any price.
It <ERR type=[vp6,1-]> succeed </ERR> and became a young and powerful country.
But now its greedy heart <ERR type=[vp6,4-]> said </ERR> to itself that it <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> wanted </ERR> more, maybe at the very <ERR type=[fm2,-]> begining </ERR> it said so, we don't know It <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> wanted </ERR> more rights, or another word "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> ".
It <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> wanted </ERR> to be equal in using other countries' natural resources as those countries themselves.
And it also <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> wanted </ERR> to be equal in governing other countries as their own governments.
That's what "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> " means.
It <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> caused </ERR> the world-wide condemnation.
And now it had <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> got </ERR> what it deserved as it's <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> rewarding </ERR> and I think I needn't point out its name, let it become the history and let's forget it.
The <ERR type=[fm1,-]> arroundings </ERR> are repeating the same story in various ways.
Even from a single person we can see the shadow of "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal" </ERR> The most common "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> " <ERR type=[vp3,5-]> are </ERR> corruption.
Some high government officials make full use of their rights to be "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> ".
They live in villas and when they go out they use cars, their sons or <ERR type=[fm1,-]> daughts </ERR> also share the "more equality" to make more money.
It's unfair and dangerous, "government of the people, by the people and for the people" should be the most <ERR type=[aj3,2-]> just </ERR> and honest government.
Because life to everybody is a hard work, composed of <ERR type=[np6,2-2]> laugh </ERR> and tears But the latter one is much more than the former.
So be kind to others as well as to <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> oneself </ERR> Struggle for one's equality, and when you enjoy it don't forget to treat others equally.
Someone just cannot <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> bear </ERR> that sun shines on everybody.
We should remember: we are equal, no one is less equal, and no one is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR>
(t10-4) Equality has been long <ERR type=[fm1,-]> saught </ERR> after ever since mankind was conscious of its <ERR type=[fm2,-]> indispensibility </ERR> as one of the nuclei of human rights.
Human beings long for equality which they <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> believe </ERR> destined.
This can be best <ERR type=[fm1,-]> examplified </ERR> by that notable Declaration of <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Indepence </ERR> in 1774 in which the fourteen <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Bristish </ERR> colonies in North America advanced the idea as <ERR type=[pp1,1-5]> to </ERR> all men are created equal.
History has seen too many tragedies in which devotees of equality fall victims to the antithetic forces mounted by those frantic authoritarians who cling to the notion that still some men are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the <ERR type=[pr3,7-]> other </ERR> if they will agree that all men are equal at all.
This is the notion reflected in one of George Orwell's <ERR type=[np6,4-]> book </ERR> : The Animal Farm.
He preached that some were more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the <ERR type=[pr3,7-]> other </ERR> in the quaint hope of cooling down the mounting furiousness of the mass.
The answer will never be <ERR type=[cc4,5-]> consent </ERR> as long as there are the rich among the <ERR type=[cc1,-1]> majority </ERR> poor.
With this <ERR type=[pp2,2-]> respect </ERR> equality can just be a good wish for all concerned and some people in certain corners of the globe still <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> has </ERR> to face discrimination; be content with oppression, and wallow in despair.
Let the world grant them a wish for the best: be equal at last --- one <ERR type=[fm2,-]> divinist </ERR> thing World has not possessed.
(t10-5) After the liberation, the Chinese people became the <ERR type=[np3,5-]> host </ERR> of the country.
But I would like to say that in China today, some people are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Though the Chinese Communist Party had made great <ERR type=[np6,2-]> resolution </ERR> to root out the leader's abusing their power, the problem is till very serious.
They make good <ERR type=[fm1,-]> us </ERR> of their privilege to get what they want.
Suppose you are the head of the institute you'd better not to infringe upon their privileges if you don't want to meet the <ERR type=[cc3,2-]> trouble </ERR> I learn that in the Silk <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Corperation </ERR> of the Foreign Trade Committee in Dong Guang city, there is about half of the <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> stuff </ERR> who are the <ERR type=[np6,s-]> leader's </ERR> families or relatives.
The leadership of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> corperation </ERR> have to find some work to be done by them.
Then, it comes out that a <ERR type=[np5,1-]> work </ERR> which should be done by one person was divided into 3 parts and done by 3 persons.
On the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> country </ERR> if you were a common people, even you had college certification, and you <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> are </ERR> exactly the <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> company </ERR> need, it would still be very difficult for you to <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> enter </ERR> into it.
So, the leaders and their relatives are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
The second cause of <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> is: money.
Suppose you had a child who were at the age of 3 or 4, and should go to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kindergarton </ERR> Of course, it's quite normal that every parent <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp1,-s-]> want </ERR> their child <ERR type=[vp4,3-]> has </ERR> the best education.
But if you had not quite a lot of money, you shouldn't hope that your child <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> can </ERR> stay in the best <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> one </ERR> It needs money to bribe the board of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kindergarton </ERR> so that your child could be received.
It also needs money to pay your child's cost in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> kindergarton </ERR> which is not cheap at all.
If you had not so much money, you <ERR type=[vp8,s-]> can </ERR> only <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> sent </ERR> your child to a bad, or at least, not so good one.
Then, your child <ERR type=[vp5,s-]> grown </ERR> up, it's time for him to go to university.
Unfortunately, he <ERR type=[fm2,-]> failured </ERR> in the Entering College Exam.
If you had money, you could still help him to receive the college <ERR type=[fm1,-]> educaion </ERR> But if you couldn't support the extra expenditure --- which is really a large sum for a common worker --- your child would have no choice, he could only enter <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sociaty </ERR> to earn his living.
The gap between the rich and the poor is <ERR type=[wd3,1-]> exit </ERR> The rich is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the others.
Insofar as I am concerned, I don't think the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> will disappear in the near future.
When we look at the whole world, it may not be difficult for us to discover that some men are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others as concerning the <ERR type=[np5,s-]> colors </ERR> of them.
But deplorably enough, thousands of years passing away, the deep-rooted racial <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unjustice </ERR> and inequality are still popular.
Still today, people <ERR type=[vp6,2-]> were </ERR> shocked by the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> nutorious </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scandle </ERR> of Rodney King's case which happened in Los Angles, the USA, a country that is long viewed as the beacon of freedom and democracy.
Plagues and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> femine </ERR> are <ERR type=[fm2,-]> wide-spreaded </ERR> Every morning they wake up and find that they are living in the great terror of being killed or starved.
Even within the same racial society, we still have many "big" men who are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alway </ERR> more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
" <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> While </ERR> as far as <ERR type=[wd2,3-4]> wealthy </ERR> social position are involved, this can not be true.
This year, in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Indonisia </ERR> the names of the ten richest <ERR type=[np3,3-]> person </ERR> in the country have been put in order to show to the public.
<ERR type=[wd3,s-]> More </ERR> I do not deny their ability to become rich.
(t10-7) In his novel "ANIMAL FARM", George Orwell told us that the oppressed animals rose up and <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> overthrown </ERR> the Black Pig, a crude, unjust, violent tyrant.
It was true that the board had been pushed over, but it is also true that the words on it did not rot away with the wooden board, and it is still <ERR type=[fm2,-]> appliable </ERR> today.
"All men are equal" is a long-lasting dream for which so many people, both <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> in </ERR> west and <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> in </ERR> east, have fought.
The <ERR type=[fm2,-]> aged-old </ERR> dream has always been in all men's heart and still will be as long as they exist.
It is till true that some are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Those who own power are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Once they held any leading position, they think themselves <ERR type=[aj2,-1]> superior </ERR> than others, ordering others to do what they like, not considering others' interests.
Furthermore, if <ERR type=[fm1,-]> ther </ERR> are <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> objected </ERR> or <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> protested </ERR> they would, within the region of their power, use all kinds of means to force his will to be obeyed.
Nearly during every term of government, there were some corruption <ERR type=[fm1,-]> scandles </ERR> some of which led to the fall of the government.
If some figures in the government, who of course <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> have </ERR> certain power, were not more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others, who would have sent money to them and <ERR type=[vp1,s-]> bid </ERR> them for help?
Apart from the persons who have power, the rich are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Nowadays, the world is more and more dominated by money, which means that the more money you have, the more rights you have and the more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> you are.
Therefore, it is obvious that they are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
In some strange conditions, some people are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others merely because of their colour of skin, even though they are neither rich nor having any power.
(t10-8) <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> "Every </ERR> people are equal, but some people are more equal.
The United States, the most advanced country in the world, also the so-called "most democratic place" At the beginning of its history, the founders had written clearly about the human rights: <ERR type=[wd3,-3]> "Every </ERR> people are born equal.
But on the other hand, we have to admit that even here some people are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Furthermore, even if you want to vote, the value of your property must <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> reach </ERR> certain standard.
Once they're elected as the <ERR type=[np3,4-]> congressman </ERR> they can enjoy a lot of privileges immediately, such as having free dinners, free transportation, free <ERR type=[fm1,-]> accomondations </ERR> etc.
In our country we can also meet a lot of such <ERR type=[np6,4-]> kind </ERR> of "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> " people.
Most of them hold high <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> position </ERR> in the government or state-owned companies.
They take full use of their power to seek extra profits, like taking bribes, finding good jobs for their relatives, <ERR type=[vp2,-6]> spending </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,s-]> country's </ERR> money on travelling, eating, going abroad, etc.
All these exert very bad influence among the <ERR type=[pp1,2-]> public </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> From </ERR> above examples, we can clearly see that at every corner of our world the "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> " people all exist.
First, I think, the central government should <ERR type=[vp2,-3]> pay </ERR> more attention on this matter and get those more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> ones out of the leadership.
Thirdly, everyone should make good <ERR type=[np3,4-1]> examples </ERR> themselves.
First of all, the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> derives from an imbalance <ERR type=[wd4,1-3]> in </ERR> distribution of wealth.
In this world, there are both people as rich as <ERR type=[fm1,-]> billionairs </ERR> and people as poor as church mice.
As for democracy, we can take the judicial system as an example to see how <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> goes on in this aspect.
Then, an expensive but eloquent and competent attorney may help him to <ERR type=[vp1,-5]> reduce </ERR> the sentence several years shorter or even prove him innocent, though he does commit something guilty.
But people under their control always like to <ERR type=[vp1,-6]> regard </ERR> them as more <ERR type=[aj3,1-][aj2,-]> superior </ERR> than them and try every means to please them, expecting they can get <ERR type=[cc3,1-]> favour </ERR> from them one day.
In term of this division of labour <ERR type=[wd4,1-1]> of </ERR> society, people are not equal either.
Next reflection of <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> lies between different races, racial discrimination is mostly existing in white people dominating countries with a multi-race background.
In these countries, though the human rights of <ERR type=[pr3,4-]> its </ERR> citizens of colour has been improved a lot through the ages, there is still a long way to go.
Two years ago, a <ERR type=[fm3,-]> negro </ERR> was beaten to death by the policemen in Los Angeles.
This violation <ERR type=[vp6,d]> had </ERR> aroused indignation and outcry of the public.
To put the foresaid <ERR type=[wd1,4-1]> three </ERR> aspects to a nutshell, though all the governments in the world <ERR type=[fm1,-]> alledge </ERR> their countries to a free, equal and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> franternal </ERR> one, many unequal phenomena cannot be totally got rid of after all.
Though the slogan of "all men are equal" is prevailing for many <ERR type=[np3,1-]> year </ERR> there are still some people who are "more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the others", even if it is all too bad for us to admit it.
(t10-10) People in each country of the world have <ERR type=[vp9,1-]> struggle </ERR> for freedom and equality for hundreds of years, and it is now nearly the end of the 20 century.
Are all men <ERR type=[wd6,s-]> are </ERR> equal today?
" Actually, these words illustrated the human right situation in the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Sovil </ERR> Union of the day, and also that of the world.
Fifty years have passed now, and the world <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> have </ERR> changed a lot.
Are these <ERR type=[np3,1-]> word </ERR> still <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> be </ERR> true?
Still in every country, no matter socialism or capitalism, there are some people more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
There are many causes for this <ERR type=[fm2,-]> phenomenent </ERR> Here I would like to mention three, which are common and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> tipical </ERR> The first reason <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> leads </ERR> to the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unequalness </ERR> is the unequal distribution of <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> poverty </ERR> The current distribution system is enlarging the gap between the rich and the poor.
Although according to the law, the rich and the poor are all <ERR type=[np3,s-]> civilian </ERR> of a country, and have the same rights <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> and </ERR> legally equal.
The richer a person is, the more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> he will be.
This conclusion can be proved by a <ERR type=[wd2,1-1]> simply </ERR> example.
A man is accused <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> for </ERR> shoplifting, if he is rich, he can engage the best lawyer or bribe the judge, and he may be free after paying some fine.
But for a <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> poor </ERR> who <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> committed </ERR> the same crime, he has no money to engage a lawyer or bribe the judge, so he has to be in prison for several years.
The second reason is that <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> in </ERR> nowadays there are two different <ERR type=[np3,2-]> stratum </ERR> in the society.
The more power one has, the more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> he will be.
A president of a company can give a good position to the son of a government official who is in charge of tax exchanging for lower taxes than other <ERR type=[np6,s-]> company </ERR> And a mayor can promise to a judge that he would help him become the chief if he gives his nephew who committed a crime a lenient punishment.
The last reason is the difference between different <ERR type=[np6,1-]> country </ERR> different <ERR type=[np6,1-]> culture </ERR> and different races.
Some races, which <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> is </ERR> less developed or had <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> been </ERR> in lower position in history, <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> is </ERR> now being discriminated and unequally treated.
To sum up, people are becoming more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> today, but we still have a long way to go.
Various <ERR type=[wd5,1-1]> of </ERR> reasons have made us unable to <ERR type=[vp4,1-]> achieved </ERR> the target our forerunners had struggled for for ages today.
So long as these problems such as the unequal distribution of <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> poverty </ERR> or the commodity of <ERR type=[wd7,3-]> power </ERR> between <ERR type=[np6,1-]> official </ERR> or the racial discrimination exist, the world will never be equal, and the saying "All men are equal, but some are more equal than other" will always be true.
(t10-11) Have you ever seen the film "Animal Farm" adapted by <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Georgy </ERR> Orwell?
In this film, there is a famous saying which <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> was </ERR> stuck out by the black pig when he finally <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> seized </ERR> power.
That is, "All men are equal, but some <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> one </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> are </ERR> more equal than others!
First, on a world-wide scale, some countries are indeed more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others!
America, <ERR type=[pr5,1-]> who </ERR> boasts its indispensable role as a "world police", is at all times <ERR type=[fm2,-]> interferring </ERR> with others' internal affairs.
Putting sanctions against those who refuse to obey his orders, or lifting <ERR type=[fm2,-]> embargos </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,2-]> on </ERR> the countries finally giving up their positions, Uncle Sam is watching impatiently for his chance to put this world under control.
The United Nations, which is a comprehensive body formed with members of most nations in the world and supposed to deal with the international affairs <ERR type=[wd2,5-]> just </ERR> and fairly, is finally <ERR type=[vp7,s-]> turned </ERR> out to be a "magic word" played by the superpowers on a wide political stage.
On the other hand, the third world, now struggling its way for a better life, is not only dragged by the backward economy and low-leveled education, but also bearing an overwhelming pressure created by some so-called international "peace-keeping <ERR type=[fm1,-]> troups </ERR> ".
In this case, it's hard for the people of these countries to keep territorial integrity and maintain political independence, let <ERR type=[vp2,s-]> along </ERR> human rights and social democracy!
They are simply the dreams far beyond average person's reach and only appear on the screen when the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> arragant </ERR> westerners use them as weapons to attack their opponents.
Second, on a nation-wide scale, it's been a common <ERR type=[np5,2-]> knowledge </ERR> for people to hear the talks of power-abusing, duty-corrupting or bribery-accepting by some high-level officials up to the nameless self-employed <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> laborers </ERR> Most of these people either occupy an important position in the government organization, or enjoy some reputation in the literary and art circles, or simply have a fairly large fortune in the bank.
It's them who make up a "noble class" in contemporary China, and now are regarded <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> as </ERR> superior to those ordinary citizens in terms of ease and comfort.
However, despite their poor income and low social status, we must admit, they are the backbone of our nation and should be <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> paid </ERR> more respect as well as <ERR type=[fm2,-]> rewardings </ERR> for their life-long <ERR type=[np5,2-3]> devotions </ERR> to this society!
Now, with the famous words "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" echoing back in mind it could be figured out that this not <ERR type=[ad1,s-]> only </ERR> reflects the past, but also the present, and I hope, it won't fulfill a same future!
(t10-12) Thousands of years had <ERR type=[wd3,4-]> past </ERR> till some brave and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> opimistic </ERR> British men announced publicly that "All men <ERR type=[fm1,-]> a </ERR> created equal" in 1689.
We have got great progress, as we all know, <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> that </ERR> we almost demolished kings or queens and it is written down in most nations' constitutions that all men are equal.
It is true that all men are equal now but it is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> true </ERR> that some are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
In this equal world, lots of people are still concerned <ERR type=[aj2,3-]> on </ERR> the <ERR type=[np5,s-]> colors </ERR> of <ERR type=[pr1,s-]> them </ERR> and racial discrimination still <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> exist </ERR> It is quite <ERR type=[wd2,3-2]> obviously </ERR> if you put your view on South <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Affrica </ERR> where <ERR type=[np6,s-]> black </ERR> still can not enjoy the same rights as <ERR type=[np6,s-]> white </ERR> Even in the United States, the freest and <ERR type=[aj3,-]> equalest </ERR> nation, <ERR type=[np6,s-]> black </ERR> <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dose </ERR> not <ERR type=[vp2,3-3]> match </ERR> to the white totally.
Usually blacks get poorer education and living <ERR type=[np6,s-]> condition </ERR> Their social position <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> are </ERR> lower.
They are still crippled by the chains of discrimination and <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> suffered </ERR> police brutality.
While Martin Luther King died with his great dream thirty years ago in <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Losangel </ERR> a fierce racial conflict broke out for the same reason King worried about.
Apart from the racial <ERR type=[fm1,-]> unequality </ERR> man also <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> face </ERR> the problem of wealth.
This difference is becoming more and more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> bigger </ERR> So we have five stars hotel as well as the benches in the parks.
A <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> rich </ERR> can pay a fine in <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> stead </ERR> of <ERR type=[vp4,]> go </ERR> to jail.
A <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> rich </ERR> can employ the best doctor and a <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> rich </ERR> can even sometimes destroy a <ERR type=[wd4,2-3l]> poor </ERR> with his money, if he <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> like </ERR> The third thing I want to mention is the equality between men and women.
Nowadays, thanks to the Women Liberation Movement, women get lots of rights from their rivals, but women are in some ways still in a subordinate position like <ERR type=[pp1,1-]> before </ERR> They do the same work as men but <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> be </ERR> paid little.
Wives must take their husbands' names and they usually do most <ERR type=[wd4,2-1]> of </ERR> housework no matter who <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> earned </ERR> bread.
It is common to see <ERR type=[np6,-s-]> husband </ERR> <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> enjoy </ERR> <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> reading </ERR> evening newspaper while his wife is washing dishes.
Furthermore, in lots of places, <ERR type=[np3,s-]> women </ERR> is just a subject of men.
The only duty of her is to <ERR type=[fm1,-]> satified </ERR> her man's <ERR type=[fm1,-]> sexal </ERR> request and <ERR type=[wd2,-1]> product </ERR> children.
In these places people sometimes will kill <ERR type=[fm1,-]> femal </ERR> <ERR type=[np6,2-]> baby </ERR> for their inclinations of <ERR type=[np6,1-]> boy </ERR> It is said that "even a cat can face the king", but I am sure if this cat annoys the king he will easily <ERR type=[vp9,3-]> has </ERR> this cat's head cut down.
In our equal world, there are some people decide to fight with the <ERR type=[fm2,-]> neighber </ERR> country and it is some others who have to pick up guns.
So, <ERR type=[vp5,-2]> accord </ERR> to these, I must say that equality has not <ERR type=[wd3,-]> down </ERR> with all God's children.
We still have a long way to go before we can sing together happily "Equal at last, equal at last, <ERR type=[np2,-2]> thanks </ERR> God <ERR type=[47plncprg]> almighty </ERR> we are equal at last!
" (t10-13) In <ERR type=[fm1,-]> Geroge </ERR> Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
So as a large country in the world, China <ERR type=[vp3,s-]> face </ERR> this question as well.
After a <ERR type=[fm2,-]> long-termed </ERR> hard struggle, Chinese people gained freedom and the equal right, especially in the recent years, with the implementation of the Open Policy and other <ERR type=[fm1,-]> enlighterned </ERR> policies, Chinese economy is raising at a stunning speed, and Chinese people have a stable life.
But we have to admit that the people who are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others are still <ERR type=[wd2,2-]> existence </ERR> These men can be divided into two kinds.
It is the <ERR type=[np1,-1]> authority </ERR> that <ERR type=[pr5,-]> they </ERR> look down upon the average <ERR type=[cc1,1-]> person </ERR> , and think that they are the men of noble birth; It is the <ERR type=[np1,-1]> authority </ERR> that <ERR type=[pr5,-]> they </ERR> solve some sticky questions easily which common people treat as difficult ones; It is the <ERR type=[np1,-1]> authority </ERR> that <ERR type=[pr5,-]> they </ERR> always are accorded courteous reception wherever they go, and their relatives and friends also benefit from them.
So, it appears that the average people are sweating in packed buses, while they are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> glacing </ERR> over streets through the dark brown window of their luxury cars; the average <ERR type=[np3,s-]> person </ERR> are lining up for tickets while they are <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dialling </ERR> gracefully; the average <ERR type=[np3,s-]> person </ERR> are rushing about <ERR type=[fm1,-]> simpal </ERR> things while they sign their names skilfully on brief informal <ERR type=[np6,3-]> note </ERR> All these <ERR type=[np3,2-]> privilege </ERR> separate them from the mass and make them more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
As they have money, they can buy all kinds of special service and <ERR type=[fm1-]> convienence </ERR> In people's views, these rich men are also more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Today's society is developing <ERR type=[fm2,-]> speedly </ERR> and at the same time, our country is trying <ERR type=[wd3,1-1]> it's </ERR> best to suit this development with perfecting <ERR type=[24cyzsbrc]> it's </ERR> rules and regulations.
So during this period, though the unreasonable <ERR type=[fm2,-]> phenomenons </ERR> like these are still <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> exist </ERR> we believe that they will be eliminated one day, and we look forward to the coming of that day.
If this is true, there should <ERR type=[wd4,d]> be </ERR> slavery, segregation and sexual injustice.
The reality is: some men, most from the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dominent </ERR> class in the society, regard themselves as more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> men, as the privileged class.
Look at the status of American <ERR type=[fm3,-]> negro </ERR> Segregation will always exist as long as the whites still bear the thought in mind that they are the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> dominent </ERR> class, they are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the <ERR type=[fm2,-][fm3,-]> negros </ERR> In such a deteriorating society, you are judged not by the content of your character but simply by the color of your skin.
A <ERR type=[fm3,-]> negro </ERR> does not have the equal rights in politics, economy and culture as a white man has.
A court may sentence a <ERR type=[fm3,-]> negro </ERR> to death for a sin for which a white man will only be sentenced to one or two years' imprisonment.
Racial differences <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> makes </ERR> unequal rights.
Pick up a <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> newspaper </ERR> you will easily find a criminal case of corruption.
They seem to be more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the ordinary people.
Not until these social <ERR type=[np3,2-]> moth </ERR> have been eliminated will our society <ERR type=[vp9,s-]> has </ERR> a bright future, will our people lead a happy life, enjoying the equal rights the law has promised them.
Take a look at the joint-venture enterprises in Guangdong <ERR type=[fm3,-]> province </ERR> , you will probably be shocked by the unfair treatment of millions of workers who have come to Guangdong to fulfil their dreams of success.
They are just treated as cheap <ERR type=[wd3,s-][wd4,s-]> labor </ERR> even working machines.
Eighty-one workers, <ERR type=[wd4,1-]> most </ERR> from northern provinces, lost their lives in the great fire which broke out a few days ago.
Because there isn't any fire-fighting <ERR type=[np5,-]> equipments </ERR> in the factory at all.
Because they <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> have </ERR> been locked in the workshop by their boss <ERR type=[wd5,s-]> so </ERR> what they could do was only to wait to die.
When and how will such <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> in all aspects be completely wiped out?
It is true that all men are getting more and more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> with the development of the society and the expansion of democracy in our lives.
But we have to admit that <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> still <ERR type=[vp3,3-]> exist </ERR> almost everywhere.
(t10-15) In his novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
" These words were the <ERR type=[np4,1-1]> writers </ERR> irony to some of the leaders of the former Soviet Union.
But in today's Russia, the phenomenon of breaking <ERR type=[np6,s-]> promise </ERR> and dictatorship still exists.
He <ERR type=[vp1,-s-]> criticized </ERR> the Communist Party monopolizing the politics.
He said the Communist Party should tolerate different opinions and allow other <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> party </ERR> to take part in the election.
But after he became a <ERR type=[fm3,1-]> President </ERR> he didn't keep his promise.
He behaved in contrast <ERR type=[pp2,-2]> with </ERR> his promise.
According to the President's promise, since Russia was a "democracy", any major problem should be determined <ERR type=[np6,s-1]> by </ERR> people.
In <ERR type=[fm2,1-]> stead </ERR> of holding a poll, the President dissolved the parliament.
All people <ERR type=[vp3,2-][vp6,d]> has </ERR> converged on him.
He can do whatever he <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> like </ERR> without any opposition.
He is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
The president <ERR type=[vp3,2-]> do </ERR> not have a sense of equality and <ERR type=[fm1,-]> fairplay </ERR> He <ERR type=[vp3,1-]> think </ERR> he is more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than his opponent.
The president <ERR type=[vp9,2-]> don't </ERR> think that he is equal to others.
But some people become <ERR type=[fm1,-]> millionair </ERR> in this slack season, of whom 90% are officials.
They become rich because they have more power; because they are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Therefore I think the phenomenon that some are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others still exists in today's Russia.
Some animals were more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
Although, I learnt many things about the old society from my parents Since the <ERR type=[wd4,2-2]> policy </ERR> opening to the outside world was introduced in 1979 and we achieved the comprehensive modernization of agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology.
So I think the idea of <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> almost <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> disappeared </ERR> The important point is depending on your hard working But in a large factory The problem <ERR type=[pp1,-s-]> of </ERR> some workers are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others still remains.
My mother and some women make packing <ERR type=[np6,2-1]> bag </ERR> of goods in one of the workshops in the factory.
The more you wire, the more you <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> got </ERR> paid.
One they call is "soft <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> piece", </ERR> other is "hard piece".
If they get the soft piece, it's more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> easy </ERR> and <ERR type=[aj3,4-]> quick </ERR> for them to wire <ERR type=[np6,2-]> bag </ERR> In order to make more money, some women flatter the supervisor of the workshop.
My mother <ERR type=[cc3,-2]> disgusts </ERR> this practice, so her pay is lower than others and she <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> felt </ERR> unhappy with her work.
When I know that I also <ERR type=[vp6,s-]> felt </ERR> very angry.
I suggest my <ERR type=[vp4,3-]> mother </ERR> report this bad phenomenon to the factory director, and <ERR type=[vp4,s-]> get </ERR> rid of this bad <ERR type=[wd7,s-]> practice </ERR> I have <ERR type=[np6,1-1]> dream </ERR> now.
Only because <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> of </ERR> different colours of their skin from the white, colour citizens have to take harder work and get lower pay.
Their children can not receive education as high as they want, not because they are not clever enough, but because they have <ERR type=[wd3,-2]> no </ERR> enough money.
And the black, the poorest people in Brazil, who account for 10% of the population, only possess no more than 1% <ERR type=[wd4,-2]> of </ERR> total wealth.
Only if colour people are set free, equality will have <ERR type=[fm2,-]> truely </ERR> come.
Since the Women's Liberation of the 1960s, women's status and conditions <ERR type=[vp3,4-]> has </ERR> attracted increasing attention.
Apart from the two forms mentioned, <ERR type=[fm1,-]> inquality </ERR> in this society has many other various forms.
Obviously there is still a long way to go, but I believe with everyone's efforts, this dream will come true someday, and by that time all men will be <ERR type=[fm1,-]> truely </ERR> equal.
" It is true that the law of America has recognized that all citizens of America are equal and they all have the same rights, despite of different beliefs, religions, races, <ERR type=[np5,-]> educations </ERR> ...
Politically, it is clearly stated <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> in </ERR> American Law that citizens have this or that kind of right, including the right to run for the presidency.
We all know that none of the last candidates who run for the presidency in America are not <ERR type=[np3,s-]> millionaire </ERR> or <ERR type=[np3,s-]> billionaire </ERR> So the "equal" rights to vote and the "equal" rights to be elected are actually <ERR type=[fm1,-]> seperated </ERR> and the right to be voted is only a "patented article" of the millionaires, or the billionaires.
" Moreover, some white men are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than some black men.
Though other animals felt angry at the inequality, they dared not speak out, because the pigs raised a lot of fierce dogs to <ERR type=[vp5,1-]> punished </ERR> those who dared to defy their authority.
It's only a tale, but you can <ERR type=[wd4,1-2]> find </ERR> reflection of the <ERR type=[fm1,-]> huamn </ERR> society.
But most of the time we can see some people who are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
It's obvious that those who have got some power can be more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than other common ones.
They would set up rules for others to obey, but they themselves needn't obey <ERR type=[pr3,s-]> it </ERR> thoroughly.
So they become members of the group who are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
So the fact that there are always some people who are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others still exists today, and will last for a long long time.
In the American Constitution it was declared officially that all men are created <ERR type=[fm1,-]> eqaul </ERR> But in effect, it was not the case.
As a result, <ERR type=[fm2,-]> unequality </ERR> together with other factors <ERR type=[fm1,-]> begat </ERR> the American Civil War.
Negroes are still <ERR type=[wd2,s-]> contempted </ERR> and are not as equal as the whites.
Still remember the accident in which the victim, a black person broke the traffic <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> law, </ERR> took place in Los Angeles two years ago?
More unexpectedly, after the controversial trial, the two white policemen were declared <ERR type=[fm2,-]> inguilty </ERR> Though the case is on trial again under the public pressure and the result is still unknown, we can come to a conclusion from what we have learned so far that in America, the country which calls itself the most equal society in the world, there still exist some people who are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
In America, when you have a desire to run for <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> Senator </ERR> <ERR type=[wd3,s-]> President </ERR> or whatever it is, it is quite impossible for you to get the upper hand over your opponents if you have no strong backup.
<ERR type=[wd3,-2]> At </ERR> such <ERR type=[np6,2-]> circumstance </ERR> you cannot afford the expensive fee of the publicity which will certainly help to make you familiar to the public and as a result will do good to your victory.
Since not all American citizens are billionaires or <ERR type=[np3,s-]> millionaire </ERR> those who are not, I must say most of them are not, will by all means not hold their own with those who are.
In another word, the rich are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than others.
(t10-21) The Declaration of <ERR type=[wd5,3-1]> the </ERR> Independence says: All men are created equal.
Equality, which men have been <ERR type=[fm1,-]> persued </ERR> struggled for and dreamed of for thousands of years, is still our dreams.
Some people are more <ERR type=[aj3,1-]> equal </ERR> than the others among our equally-born creatures.
It is not <ERR type=[wd4,s-]> surprising, </ERR> in China especially in the countryside, men account for most of the people who ask for divorce in the court.
She will be thought to be <ERR type=[fm2,-]> adultering </ERR> or degenerated.
