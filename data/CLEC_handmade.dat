The purpose is currently research, however, it is <ERR targ=hoped> hope </ERR> that the data will later be used commercially.
I have recently been made aware of the fact, that awarding bodies of special arrangements in examinations are being advised that, assessment of support needs should not be <ERR targ=focused> focussed </ERR> on specific learning difficulties, but on simply difficulties.
I've seen several examples of simply less able students being told they are dyslexic, when in fact they show few or no signs considering the <ERR targ=different> difference </ERR> method of diagnosis.
I am hoping i <ERR targ=won't> wont </ERR> get down graded too much.
The greatest thing you can give your son is the knowledge that he is not dumb or lazy, the knowledge that he will need to find, what works for him, is valuable on the way to becoming someone who is on top of a problem, rather than some <ERR targ=whose> who's </ERR> problem is <ERR targ=on> no </ERR> top of them.
This is <ERR targ=a> an </ERR> <ERR targ=new> knew </ERR> discovery and one worth noting.
I'm really glad there <ERR targ=are> is </ERR> message boards like this.
I have a web site on famous dyslexics and a link to <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> .
Her class was working on a project about dyslexics, this is what she said about <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> findings for Bush.
I have written several times to leave <ERR targ=this> his </ERR> mailbase and each time it has not worked.
Therefore the gift side is able to continue to function <ERR targ=with> will </ERR> all its blessings.
However I have noticed that a lot of dyslexics get agro/negative at anybody who suggests that it could be <ERR targ=cured> cure </ERR> . 
I think it is important to keep an open mind about help, and investigate who has developed it and <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> "world view" i.e. are <ERR targ=they> the </ERR> dyslexic, are they someone from an ivory tower who has not personal experience but a set of numbers? 
The other people cause themselves to be failures in life because <ERR targ=they> the </ERR> focus on <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> problem.
I have observed both <ERR targ=types> type </ERR> of people in the dyslexic community, and have come to the conclusion that the 2nd type wouldn't truly take the offer of "cure/help" because it would take <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> problem away.
They just can't see how the Davis, (or any other <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> far out of the system) would work. 
Because it is <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> far outside the box, <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> far outside the norm people <ERR targ=generally> general </ERR> can't accept it. 
This is why it took 50 yrs of doctors to wash <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> hands between patients!
Things that are just <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> far outside the normal take time to be accepted into the society culture. 
The real test is <ERR targ=whether> weather </ERR> dedicated people are willing to fight it out for 10+ years being active in promotion, and research to back up their views.
My thoughts, in a <ERR targ=fill> full </ERR> in the blanks style.
However some people do not understand that <ERR targ=there> their </ERR> are talents associated with dyslexic and offer cures, without focusing on the strengths as well.
I remember doing spelling ones at school, however I am looking for something more broad, that covers <ERR targ=comprehension> compression </ERR> etc.
I <ERR targ=purchased> purchase </ERR> this for my son recently who took it to his school Northease Manor, a specialised school for Dyslexia in East Sussex and they have shown some interest.
I would be interested in the version for smaller text for myself as I am <ERR targ=increasingly> increasing </ERR> aware of my own dyslexia.
He has a style of governing that could be described <ERR targ=as> at </ERR> intuitive.
Students use <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> identification number on the sticker and <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> marked to our dyslexia guidelines. 
 <ERR targ=it's> Its </ERR> not <ERR targ=two> too </ERR> bites at the cherry!
Is the argument we/the school system don't have any other methods of examination possible / developed <ERR targ=a> at </ERR> valid one?
This would be a basic requirement for <ERR targ=an> a </ERR> average society.
Don't think that is <ERR targ=an> a </ERR> unfair demand to put down.
It is one occasion time where one is expected to deliver under time now and also <ERR targ=a> an </ERR> very unnatural environment. 
Nobody <ERR targ=is> are </ERR> currently locked in any room with only their pen and calculator ?
I would also like to find out more about dyslexia and how it <ERR targ=affects> effects </ERR> people.
It would be really nice if you could find some time to fill in my <ERR targ=questionnaire> questioner </ERR> please.
Do you think that you should be kept in at <ERR targ=break> brake </ERR> time to complete unfinished work ? 
She had thought that it was just a problem with being old and not having been brought up with PCs but she has discovered <ERR targ=that> hat </ERR> her 'A' level students are printing out <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> computer based texts as they find it much easier to learn from paper.
Money is an issue so recommendations of adequate but <ERR targ=cheap> cheep </ERR> would be as useful as "this is marvelous but it costs a fortune".
They often leave a lot to be desired re readability and presentation lots of text turn off but most books appear to be of this <ERR targ=vein> vain </ERR> .
Did you find out <ERR targ=where> were </ERR> the examples came from.
Royal Oak is a centre that used to be based on the lake, i think it is still <ERR targ=there> their </ERR> .
There are those who miss <ERR targ=out> our </ERR> because they unsubscribe due to too much mail.
It is all too <ERR targ=frequently> frequent </ERR> misused as a term to describe human beings.
You must be aware that life <ERR targ=is> if </ERR> not like that. 
Most dyslexics who have a reading problem experience a surge of improvement in their <ERR targ=teens> teems </ERR> although the rate of reading never quite reaches that of the non-dyslexic.
I have been following the thrust and parry with great interest so hope that my request is not <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> <ERR targ=minor> miner </ERR> . 
I have tried the publisher with not <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> much success.
I was very <ERR targ=interested> interest </ERR> on reading <ERR targ=your> you </ERR> e-mail.
My daughter is 14 <ERR targ=been> be </ERR> <ERR targ=statmented> statement </ERR> since 1997.
Went to a <ERR targ=special> specials </ERR> school for 12 months then was <ERR targ=put> but </ERR> back in mainstream school. 
In <ERR targ=special> specials </ERR> school her reading went up 17 months and spelling 10 months. 
After being in mainstream for 3 years her <ERR targ=spelling> spell </ERR> has gone up 6 month. 
It took 6 months of <ERR targ=delays> belays </ERR> having asked to go back in <ERR targ=special> specials </ERR> school again.
I got two 15 minutes twice a week I was told on Fridays as this was would meet her <ERR targ=needs> needed </ERR> .
It will <ERR targ=take> tack </ERR> two weeks to get the new statement and then I was have to go to special <ERR targ=needs> needed </ERR> <ERR targ=tribunal> tribal </ERR> .
Adopting the social model of disability we <ERR targ=ought> aught </ERR> to do something about it, but the task is just a bit on the big side and I'm already booked this week....
She has <ERR targ=now> no </ERR> been informed that her son will see <ERR targ=an> and </ERR> Educational psychologist in a week.
I wonder if I can once again ask for some <ERR targ=advice> advise </ERR> .
I totally agree that the double consonant rule is not always followed (as in the 'finish' example <ERR targ=cited> sited </ERR> ).
It does help them to create unknown spellings in a manner <ERR targ=that> than </ERR> the reader can understand.
I am glad to see research quoted in this <ERR targ=list> lists </ERR> that suggests that all Italians, dyslexics included, have an easier time <ERR targ=learning> earning </ERR> to read.
The advice I would give is to have a look at the College's prospectus and also ask the college for a copy of <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> Disability Statement.
However if <ERR targ=they> there </ERR> are not willing to give support, and don't have anything in writing, I would find out whether there is somewhere else to study the course.
I have <ERR targ=noticed> notice </ERR> some of you have been talking about coloured overlays.
If any one on the mailing list <ERR targ=has> have </ERR> had an overlay assessment previously and did not think it made a difference, I strongly recommend you get in touch again.
Unfortunately everyone is different and <ERR targ=has> have </ERR> different colours that help them to read.
I would appreciate it, if people would not send <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> colours with <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> e-mails as colours such as purple/pink make my eyes hurt.
But <ERR targ=now> know </ERR> I'm learning it is just a gift that i need to explore and cherish. 
Most of life i kept <ERR targ=it> is </ERR> secret because i was ashamed and i didn't know what was wrong with me.
I failed <ERR targ=first> fist </ERR> grade and in second grade they put me in LD classes. 
I still <ERR targ=didn't> dint </ERR> know what was wrong with me. 
No-one really <ERR targ=knew> new </ERR> how bad my writing was. 
At this i <ERR targ=started> stared </ERR> looking for answers. 
He graduated <ERR targ=from> form </ERR> Harved business school. 
He told me that it <ERR targ=taught> taut </ERR> him to be a problem solver.
I read it cover to cover the <ERR targ=first> fist </ERR> day. 
This <ERR targ=gave> cave </ERR> me insight to my life.
At age 27 i went back college the 4th time with the idea to improve what i was good at so went to art school A.I.P <ERR targ=and> an </ERR> <ERR targ=achieved> ached </ERR> a double major degree in computer animation-multimedia.
Ron davis book <ERR targ=helped> help </ERR> to understand me and to develop the talents that i have.
One of them is writing children's <ERR targ=stories> stores </ERR> . 
At age 32 i have started my own multimedia company for interactive children's stories and will <ERR targ=spend> spent </ERR> the rest of my life writing and illustrating them. 
I feel that we should work together instead of labelling one <ERR targ=another> anther </ERR> .
I have never made fun of someone because they <ERR targ=can't> cant </ERR> draw or sculpt but not being able to write is made to be to shameful. 
I took the Davis program five <ERR targ=months> mouths </ERR> ago.
Once again as I started to <ERR targ=read> reed </ERR> them I couldn't help but grin and say to myself I know that's right.
The <ERR targ=tests> test </ERR> have to be scrolled through and I don't have them in my hand so this is hard.
We need a hard copy to really do well and because of this I <ERR targ=can't> cant </ERR> make the test places understand this.
The far reaching impact of your accomplishments will help <ERR targ=thousands> thousand </ERR> of students oppressed by these state mandate tests. 
I didn't <ERR targ=fare> fair </ERR> so well on the test but I think I know why.
Can anybody help me to <ERR targ=find> fine </ERR> the good parts about being dxslexic? 
I am out of work at the moment and wonder if <ERR targ=there's> theirs </ERR> help for people who have Dyslexia to get back in to work.
 <ERR targ=it's> It </ERR> difficult <ERR targ=there> their </ERR> does not seem to be any Help for us <ERR targ=dyslexic> dyslexia </ERR> adults.
It makes me <ERR targ=feel> feels </ERR> like I can not contribute to the world of work.
We are <ERR targ=hoping> hope </ERR> to work to together to provide a forum for other <ERR targ=adults> adult </ERR> in our situation. 
I'm doing a project about how the dyslexia can affect to the children in the school, because this problem can be <ERR targ=confused> confuse </ERR> with others.
When did you discover your child <ERR targ=had> have </ERR> this "problem"? 
Did you discover his/her problem yourself or was his/her teacher who <ERR targ=told> tell </ERR> you about your child was too"slow" for his/her age?
I would really like to get to know people on <ERR targ=here> her </ERR> better, make some friends. 
I <ERR targ=feel> fell </ERR> so uncomfortable whenever I am around people.
I like being by myself in the short term but having no friends is making me so angry and just I don't know <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> like I feel so withdrawn.
I am <ERR targ=starting> staring </ERR> to worry about all of these standardized tests coming up.
When I have been paying attention to words for a <ERR targ=while> wile </ERR> and I look up I am so dizzy for a <ERR targ=while> wile </ERR> .
Sometimes my eyes just hurt <ERR targ=from> form </ERR> reading but it <ERR targ=is> it </ERR> not a vision problem because I always get 20/20 on vision tests.
The other <ERR targ=thing> think </ERR> I have noticed about my eyes is like when I have been studying for a <ERR targ=while> wile </ERR> or something my eyes become really sensitive to light.
Some of them have special <ERR targ=exemptions> exceptions </ERR> from those <ERR targ=tests> test </ERR> . 
Even if <ERR targ=you're> your </ERR> not exempted from taking the ACT or SAT they still might have special things they could do to help you out in some way.
If anyone has <ERR targ=any> an </ERR> information, I'd greatly appreciate it if you would either email me or post a response.
I just thought I'd let you know that although what you described doesn't necessarily mean <ERR targ=you're> your </ERR> dyslexic <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> worth looking into further. 
Talk about <ERR targ=guinea> genie </ERR> pig! 
I can't help but <ERR targ=notice> notes </ERR> how much the adults worry about college. 
I'm at college just now on one <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> the computers and i was told at the age <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> 7 that i would never <ERR targ=be> bee </ERR> able to read. 
I'm a very <ERR targ=severe> sever </ERR> dyslexic but very determined. 
All i have to say for all the <ERR targ=mums> mum </ERR> and <ERR targ=dads> dad </ERR> out there is don't baby <ERR targ=your> u </ERR> child.
If <ERR targ=you> u </ERR> <ERR targ=spend> speed </ERR> all <ERR targ=your> u </ERR> time protecting them they will only see themselves hopeless. 
Most <ERR targ=dyslexics> dyslexic </ERR> have low self esteem any way but i'm 17 and have no problems. 
I can cook, read, handle any type <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> animal , clean, and much more.
It makes me so much happier with myself being able to do everything <ERR targ=by> bye </ERR> myself and i have been doing since 7. 
I also feel parents spend <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> much time making excuses for the kids.
I hope this information <ERR targ=helps> help </ERR> anyone <ERR targ=trying> try </ERR> to bring up a dyslexic child.
I feel I could go on and on about the way I think being dyslexic affects me socially but will stop <ERR targ=here> hear </ERR> . 
Florescent lights in most classrooms most likely <ERR targ=wreak> wreck </ERR> havoc on students.
I haven't read a book <ERR targ=since> sense </ERR> i was 13.
It's just <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> hard to comprehend so give up.
Sure could <ERR targ=use> us </ERR> some help to know what to do to help myself read and understand what i am reading better. 
Thanks you <ERR targ=for> fro </ERR> a <ERR targ=response> responds </ERR> .
When i read i <ERR targ=can't> cant </ERR> understand what's on the page, and i find it very hard to cope with.
I also have very bad spelling, and people always pick up on that which <ERR targ=does> dose </ERR> upset me, but they don't understand. 
I was <ERR targ=bored> board </ERR> and daydreamed a lot of the time in school. 
I just learn differently <ERR targ=than> that </ERR> others.
As with most dyslexics, they are <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> own best teachers.
I suppose this is the only real good, to come from the <ERR targ=awkward> award </ERR> beginnings of childhood .
Few great <ERR targ=minds> mines </ERR> have slipped through the cracks over the past centuries.
I am going to <ERR targ=apologise> apologies </ERR> straight away for my spelling, just as it is out of habit .
Also I will <ERR targ=probably> probable </ERR> go on a bit.
I am angry that my parents had to pay for <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> three children to have private tuition.
My mum thinks it was <ERR targ=probably> probable </ERR> what I needed at the time. 
I have so much I want to say, <ERR targ=loads> load </ERR> and <ERR targ=loads> load </ERR> of it, but what I want to say the most is that after all of that I will get there I know I will.
But what makes me so sad and what is making me cry at this very moment is the fact that every day I hear of someone else who is going <ERR targ=through> thought </ERR> it.
The fact that in the vast majority of <ERR targ=schools> school </ERR> they are ignoring it.
Because it makes <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> lives simpler. 
Nothing has changed, <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> attitude has not changed.
