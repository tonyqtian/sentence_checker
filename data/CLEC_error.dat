The Chinese diet is considered to be the healthies [fm1,-] in the world.
So I am very happy to be Chinses [fm1,-] .
The worset [fm1,-] thing is that many westerners die in an early age from the heart illness.
So I thought [vp6,s-] [vp1,2-2] eat more fruit and vegetables, not to ear [wd3,1-2] too much sugar and fat is a real healthy diet.
They're the basicest [aj3,1-] food in our life.
Next, people should have more green vegetables & fruits [np5] , they're a part of a healthy diet.
People should have fewer [wd3,1-] food which contains a lot of fat, sugar, western diets are always quite unhealthy, we should ear [wd7,1-] less.
The foods which contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on is a healthy diet [vp3,s-] .
However, a new hamburgar [fm1,-] restaurant in Beijing was quite popular.
A doctor advised people not to have hamburgar [fm1,-] for it's not a good diet.
The diet [vp3,1-5] between [wd3,1-] Chinese and Western [wd2,1-] are different.
Some people said that the western food is good eatting [fm2,1-] [wd3,1-] .
It's good eatting [fm2,1-] [wd3,1-] but it isn't good for your healthy.
Because most of them are [wd5,1-] contain too much flower, fat and sugar.
People need energy everywhere, every time [wd3,1-] .
The western [wd3,-1] eat too much food with sugar and fat, like the [wd5,1-] hamburger [fm1,-] , fired [fm1,-] chicken, coca cola, chocolate and so on.
Most of the westerner [np3,1-] had [vp6,s-] weight problem and heart illness.
If every thing [fm2,1-] you eat just right and do more exercise, you will be healthy.
People [vp3,1-1] considers Chinese diet is the healthiest of all.
The things [vp3,1-3] which people needs are all in the Chinese diet.
Some people say that the food in Mcdonald's [fm1,-] restaurant and Pizza Nut is delicious.
You eat too much sugar, your body [wd7,1-2] becomes fat, after that You [fm3,1-] will have heart illness.
The Chinese diet is thought of the healthies [fm1,-] in the world.
It coutain [fm1,-] a lot of fruit and green vegetable.
But in the west, people love eat [vp1,1-] hamburgers, potato crisps, potato chips, butter, and chocolate.
But if people eat more these [aj1,1-] food, would put on weight very easily .
So people should be [wd5,1-] eat less fat and sugar.
This is a [wd5,1-] good advice.
Eat more fruits [np5] and green vegetables are good for healthy diet .
I think this diet list is good for people: everyday eat two fruits [np5] , eat more vegetables in dinner .
It's good for skin [wd7,1] .
You need water and a [wd5,1-] diet of healthy foods.
The Chinese food is considered to be the healthist [fm1,-] in the world.
Once you start to eat it, you want to eat more of [wd5,1-1] it.
It's [wd5,1-] also contains a lot of fat in the form of cakes, soft drinks, sweets and so on.
So, if you want to have a healthy body, Please [fm3,1-] don't eat much western food.
" I think everyone [vp3,1-1] want to know it.
Energy is important to [wd3,1-] us.
All of these can make you become fat, and bad for your teech [fm1,-] .
As a result, we now that a healthy diet should contain lots of fruit, green vegetables, because these [np3,1-1] thing are low in sugar and fat but rich in fibre.
Each person cares about their [wd2,1-] life.
To have a good diet can make our lifes [fm1,-] longer.
There's [wd4,s] difference between Chinese and Western diet.
In forgin [fm1,-] countries, people don't eat such healthy food.
It's [vp3,1-1] foods which contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on.
Because of this, they can put on weight very easy [ad2,1-] .
You can't only eat too much sweet foods, but also others [wd7,1-] foods.
For example, the fruits [np5] .
If you eat too much fruits [np5] , it's bad for your stomach.
As usual, the diet [wd7,1-] food must contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt, fruit, green vegetables and so on.
So to eat more fruits [np5] and vegetables than sugar, salt is better .
Everybody [vp3,1-1] want a healthy diet.
That is [wd5,1-] can make they [pr4,1-] healthy.
They eat a lot of potato crisps potato chips, butter ice-cream and [wd5,1 -] chocolate and so on.
these [fm3,1-] things make they [pr4,1-] become fat.
Several kinds of meat [vp3,3-1] is not a necessary part of meat are good for your body .
Westerners take [wd7,1-] this kind of food and don't take enough exercises.
They have a [np7,1-] unhealthy body.
Healthy Diet How many [np3,1-1] kind of foods are there in the world?
But there's one thing I know is ture [fm1,-] : the Chinese food is considered to be healthiest diet in the world.
Many doctors advise people not to eat the food which high in fat and sugr [fm1,-] .
The westerners always eat the high [wd7,1-] fat and [wd7,1-] high sugar food.
In some parts of Britain, one preson [fm1,-] in ten, by the age of thirty, has no teeth left!
That's why lot [fm2,1-] of chinese [fm3,1-] have healthy body and whiter [wd3,1-] teeth.
The western diet are [vp3,1-] high in fat.
Sugar and sault [fm1,-] .
As a result, many westerners diet [wd2,1-] at heart illness and most of them have weight problem.
So, if you want to have a healthy body [wd3,1-] , you must have a healthy diet.
If you are thin, you can eat hamburgar [fm1,-] , chocolater [fm1,-] , sugar and so on.
Both fat person [np6,2-] and thin person [np6,2-] are [wd5,1-1] need energy to live.
It doesn't [wd4,s] much sugar.
The western world [wd3,1-] , don't eat too much fat and sugar and don't take enough exercise .
Now if you walk in the street, you can see all kinds of food shop, like coffee shop, McDonald's, Timy's [fm1,-] and so on.
Many children very like McDonald's hamberger [fm1,-] , fired chicken and icecream.
Many young ladies or boys [vp3,1-1] likes [vp1,2-4] stay in the western coffee shop.
In fact, the cream, hamberger [fm1,-] milk tea, the big piece [wd3,1-] beer [vp3,1-1] has many [np8,-1] sugar and fat.
It's very unhealthy for the person's body [wd3,1-] and teeth.
" Chinese put the eat [wd3,1-] in the first" it means Chinese foods are very dilious [fm1,-] .
I think the Spanish food, the French food, the Japan [wd3,1-] food, the England food are better but the chinese [fm3,1-] food is the best.
and the most important thing is chinese [fm3,1-] food [vp3,1-1] are more healthy than [wd4,s] another countries.
So, I advise the boys and girls, the mothers and the fathers and the little lovely childrens [fm2,1-] .
They eat different of [wd5,1-] food which change [vp7,1-] into energy.
Even when you are asleep, you are sing [wd7,2-2] energy- about 65 calories an hour.
You [fm3,1-] might be using 400calories an hour.
On sports day, [wd4,s] may be using 650 calories an hour.
It contain [vp3,1-] fruit and green food.
This food just [vp3,2-1] contain a little fat, sugar, is better than western food .
It [vp3,1-1] contain so much fat, sugar, some people didn't take enough exercise.
Healthy Diet [fm3,1-] is main some fat, some fibre, many fruit, many vegetables and enough exercise .
And [wd4,s] will have bad teeth.
Now, many hamburger restaurant open on many [wd6] places.
This will hurt yourself [pr1,3-] .
I advise people [wd4,s] eat enough fat and sugar.
And remember do more exercises and wash your teeth every [wd3,1-1] day.
I had heard lots about the plane, someone told me by air was very dangerous [wd5,-1] thing, but some say no.
at [fm3,1-] that time I was a little boy, I felt deeply afraid.
When [wd3,1-] I got on the plane.
The plane began to taking [vp5,1-] off.
n [pp2,1-] the plane, I watched the TV.
Listen [vp1,-2] the music, eat [vp6,s-4] the food, and talk happily with my parents.

How can [vp6,s-] we get ready?
Also he wants [vp6,s-] to make a normal match.
But he doesn't [vp6,s-] have enough ability.
The watch would not be stop [vp9,s] .
The adjudgers [fm2,1-5] are poor in the sdjudge [fm3] of basketball match.
Can you close [wd7,1-] what I wrote?
I remember one day, the weather is [vp6,s-] rainly [fm2,1-] .
Susanna took my [wd2,1-1] up [vp2,3-] and went tomy [fm3] home.
Then she look [vp3,1-] after me carefully, because my parents didn't at home.
I was [vp6,s-] glad I have a good friend.
Every time, I always though [wd3,1-] my monkeys.
Oh, By the way, they aren't common monkey [np3,s-] .
On [pp2,-2] that time, Mom called me to saw [vp5,1-] the monkey.
I siad [fm1,-] Yes.
I think the monkey was play [wd7,1-] .
But that's wrong, one of the monkeys called Bobby, when I saw her, she lay on the floor, and the floor had very [wd5,1-] a lot of blood.
That's very terrible [vp6,s] .
I frighent [fm1,-] , I called my Mom came here .
She saw it when she arrived [vp1,1-] the house, the monkey was [vp7,s] died.

She is very importen [fm1,-] to me.
I think not body can instead of [wd2,2-] her.
But luckly [fm1,-] , we was waken up by the dog, and we put out the fire in time.
At that time, I was always afraid of travelling by plain [wd3,1-] .
I watch [vp6,s-] too much of flying accident on TV.
So when I got on the plane, I shaked [fm1,-] my hand all the time.
Flying accident is much less than road accident," I become [vp6,s-] less hand shaking.
But it's flying from Beijing to Moscow, it take [vp6,s-] ten hours nearly [ad1,1-] .
I can [vp9,1-] see only white heavy cloudy beneath us.
It's [vp6,s-] Beautiful, but I'm [vp6,s-] not so interesting in it.
" luckly [fm1,-1] , this does [vp6,s-] not happen.
But the most impressive thing in my life I think is this [wd3,1-] .
I remember it was Sunday afternoon, I was listening [vp1,1-1] music, suddenly father change [vp6,s-] the tape.
Then I heard my voice come [vp4,1-] out of the trumpet and it surprised me.
Then father came and he said: " silly [fm3] boy , you're not in it.

So, in the middle exam, I get the good mark for myself, the math's mark is one hundred and thirty-three, the chemistry [wd4,1-] is ninty [fm1,-] (the full mark is one hundred).
My rank [wd4,s] is twenty.
During these fifteen years, many thing [np3,1-] happened.
But the only [wd4,s] thing I still remember, is this [wd3,1-] .
The sun was shining hard [ad2,1-] .
At first, we [wd4,s] all very happy.
Then we reached [wd4,s] .
And their lives was very easy [wd7,1-] .
The thing they ate every day was porrdge [fm1,-] and some things which were bad to eat .
After a meal, we went to the children's framily [fm1,-] .They were really poor.
We found no dest [fm1,-] in their house.
By the talk between us, I knew all the children in that village all work [vp6,s-] hard.
I though [wd3,1-] "They were poor, but they were all hardworking.
?ut I, I [wd4,1-] richer than them, my study were very bad .
From that journey, I knew a truth: If you want to study well, you have to give [wd4,s] .
The most impressive thing in my life North Korea is a socialism [wd3,1-] country near China, I couldn't remember when I had been on this land, but its wonderful enviorment [fm1,-] & korean's [fm3,1-] passions was still in my heart.
I miss the Chinese brave warrior who had bled here [wd3,1-] , had fought for the freedom, had fought for the liberation!
There are plenty of Monuments for commemorating the friendship of [wd3,1-] China & Korea.
To impress me most is a monument on a mauntain [fm1,-] , Chinese national flag & korean [fm3,1-] national flag were put together, it meant that our friendship would never change, and a coffin was put in a tempel [fm1,-] near the monument, though I didn't [wd4,1-] who was lying in it, one thing was certain [wd3,1-] , he was a hero.

There is a river in frunt [fm1,-] of my house.
When I was [wd4,s] child I often swam their [wd3,1-] in summer.

The middle of the river was very deeply [wd2,1-] and I could not come there.
After a short [wd4,s] ,they saw me standing at the side of the river then [wd4,s] called me swam [vp1,1-] to the middle [wd4,s] .

The foreigner teacher [wd4,s] me.
Every body [wd3,1-] in the class looked at me.
I standed [fm2,-] for a moment and answer the foreigner teacher.
The classmate looked at me strangely, and then they laughed, I didn't know why they laugh [vp6,s-] at that time.
Because I just can answer the question with [wd4,s] word, "Yes, Yes is my answer.
But the foreign teacher told the students not to laugh at me, and told me not to worry about it, and then call [vp6,s-] me to go to the seat.
There are many [wd6] impressive thing [np3,2-] in my life.

So many people didn't catch the safe belt [wd4,s] flew to the top of the plane.
Luckly [fm1,-] I caught my safe belt.
In that night, my mothe [fm1,-] got up and helped me to eat the pill.
My mother very stricted [fm1,-] by me.
Since [wd3,1-] three years ago, I began to get to know this society.
We don't [vp9,1-1] knew each other at all.
Miss Wang was also our head teacher and maths [fm1,-] teacher.
In my life, there were many [wd6] impressive things, they are all Improtant [fm1,-] for me.
This for me is very impression [wd2,-] .
Before that time I was sure that is boy's games and it was very diffcult [fm1,-] for us.
So every classes must be chose [vp9,1-] some helthy [fm1,-] girls to do this .
We often make some excises not to pratise [fm1,-] .
When hand [wd7,1-2] teacher Liu found this, we were lessoned [wd2,2-] by him.

You not only pratised [fm1,-] well, but also the storgest [fm1,-] .
We heard the other classmate said, " hoory [fm1,-] , you are well done *" How the most impressive thing in my life.
While I was young, I didn't go out because I was afraid the other children would fighten [fm1,-] me.
I uausally [fm1,-] help [vp6,s-] my mother with housework.
One day, my mother went out, I came back from school, but I didn't bright [wd3,1-] the keys.

The boy ran to his bedroom and brought some medisines [fm1,-] .
Every player were [vp3,1-] very hard.
Everybody were [vp3,1-] very happy.
In one's life, I think there are so much [np8,s-] impressive thing [np3,s-] will happen.

When I was a child, I don't [vp6,s-] know everything.

Especially in the morning and the afternoon when the people have to go for work or come back from work, althought [fm1,-] you stand near the subway station, a lot of people walk quickly towards you and leave you in no time, you just have no place to stay for a minute, maybe time for them is the most important, I could really understand "Time is money" The third day when I got here [wd7,1-] , my elder cousin showed me around his university: The Hong Kong Science University and we had a good time there.
Of course the environment here [wd7,1-] is wonderful.
The lives here [wd7,1-] are interesting.
The environment here [wd7,1-] is wonderful.

But there's one thing I feel so deep, and I'm sure that it makes me wanna [fm1,-] be a nice people .
That was a saturday [fm3,1-] afternoon, I was sitting on the floor and drinking a bottle of juice.
My father sitting beside me, he [wd6, 4-] was looking a newspaper.
Suddenly, I heard a loud noice [fm1,-] : " son!

That was at [wd3,1-] 1989?
: at that the [wd5,1-] New Year, My father gave me one hundreds year for pocket when I took a pieces of one hundreds year, I was very happy.
That hundred [wd4,1-] year I used for three months.
But now hundred [wd4,1-] year can't used for one day something.
On [wd3,1-] Septemper [fm1,-] , 1994, my parents sent me to this school.
Though you're unhappy now, I'm sure after some days, you will [wd4,s] happy again.
My childhood is full of happy [wd2,1-] and bitter [wd2,1-] .
But sometimes I did sth [fm1,-] wrong and made them worried and sad.
I remembered when I was a school girl, A [fm3,1-] new student came to our class, she is a tall girl.
Slowly, I changed, I always came home late and did not work hard, my parents and the teacher noticed my [wd2,1-] many times.
At last, she asked me to go out for glaying [fm1,-] , but I had no much money, because my mother didn't give me any more, and I knew they wouldn't let me go our with her.
So she suggested me to take mother's money away without telling her, and my mother dioovered [fm1,-] my bad deed.
She didn't hit me but cried, and I was frightened because my strong mother never cry before people, I began to realized [vp5,1-] that it was rather serious, so I conceded my mistake, but when my tall friends knew that, she was angry, she said I was foolish and never had a word with me, after that when I told my mother about it, Mum said: " as friend she shouldn't ask you to come home late, ask you to steal, she is not a real friend or a good friend.
And I realized that I was rather foolish at that time, because I made a person who nearly let me go [wd4,s] the wrong way as my best friend.
I'll neven [fm1,-] forget this lesson.
When I was six years old, my parents sent me to the swimming school and learn how to swim you may ask me: " why [fm1,-] ?
" I think that may be [wd7,s] my parents wanted to make my body stronger and stronger than the others of my age.
But later, I found it more diffcult [fm1,-] than I had thought .
So I didn't like swimming and began to take it .when [fm3,-s] the teacher asked me to jump into water and swimming [vp5,7-] a long way, I just told a lie to the teacher, and sit near the water just looking at the other children in the water.
That [wd3,1-] is the most impressive thing in my life?
When I was a baby, my mother often filled the bathtub with water nd [fm1,-] put me in it when she was going to get ready for the meals.

Then I turn [vp6,d] to a new Primary [fm3,2-2] [wd4,3-2] called YuCai [fm3,-] .I studied [wd4,2-3] Janior [fm3,-2] middle school at twelve in 1994.
in [fm3,-s] the school I studied maths, English and so on then I don't know [vp6,s] why I study and to study, but still like [vp6,s] to do it.
I prefer to study computer [cc3,1-] .
in [fm3,-s] the class I could study and play in [wd3,1-4] the same time.
I finished my Juior [fm1,-] middle school study and continue [vp6,s-] [wd4,1-1] study in high middly [fm1,-] school in 1996.Now, I am a middle school student, I found it much different from times ago .
First, I like to study and known [vp4,5-3] study is a [np7,-2] interested [aj4,1-1] thing and it become [vp3,1-] a [np7,-2] important part in my life, I want to study.
I like all the sport [np6,2-] for example play [vp4,2-4] basketball and so on.
Last study [wd5,1-1] term with my classmates won the first price in Grade One, sport become [vp3,1-] a [np7,-2] important part in my life too.
And I like music too popular song [np6,1-] , country music and so on.
These are something about me what do you thing [fm1,-] about me?
my [fm3,-s] friend, Jim, is a zoo-keeper in the National Zoo.
Every morning the zoo-keepers have to eat [wd3,-1] up at five to prepare the food for the animals.
Each kind of animals is giver [wd7,-] special food.
the [fm3,-s] lions must be giver [fm1,-] meat, the griaffes [fm1,-] must be given grass and leaves, the parrots must be given fruit and nuts, and so on.
sometimes [fm3,-s] some animals won't let the others eat their food.
If this happens each of them must be separately [wd2,2-] .every [fm3,-s] morning each cage must be washed by the zoo-keepers.
This can be dengerous [fm1,-] , especially with lions and tigers.
To make the work easier, the animals are locked in the sleeping comparment [fm1,-] while the cages are being washed.
It is nit [fm1,-] easy to inject a silk lien [fm2,-] !
radio [fm3,-s] and television are very useful in the world.
they [fm3,-s] may be seen everywhere.
television [fm3,-s] of course is more useful than radio.
on [fm3,-s] TV we can see that [wd3,3-4] is happeared [fm1,-] around us.
however [fm3,-s] , radio is not disappeared [vp7,3-] .
It can be done very small [wd7,s] .
You can put one in your pocket and listen to [wd4,s-] in the bus or on your bike.
and [fm3,-s] radio is much more cheaper [aj3,2-] than television.
once [fm3,-s] there were two mice.
after [fm3,-s] many years the country mouse saw the city mouse.
He said," do [fm3,3-s] come and see me at my house in the country.
" so [fm3,-s] the city mouse went.
the [fm3,-s] country mouse took him to his house in a field.
the [fm3,-s] city mouse said ,"this [fm3,-s] food is not good , and your house is not good .
why [fm3,-s] do you live in a hole in the field?
You can live in a mice house [cc1,1-] make [vp4,4-2] of store.
You must came [vp9,1-] and see me at my house in the city.
it [fm3,-s] was a very good house.
Nice food was set [wd5,-] ready for them to eat.
but [fm3,-s] just as they began to eat they heard a great noise.
The city mouse cried: run [fm3,1-1] !
Run [fm3,1-1] !
the [fm3,-s] cat is coming!
" they [fm3,-s] ran away quickly and hid.
after [fm3,-s] some time they came out.
when [fm3,-s] they came out the country mouse said: "I don't like living in the city.
as [fm3,-s] a senior student, you may have realized the importance of English.
But how can you study English well?I think it necessary that you shoud [fm1,-] try you [pr4,-1] best to use English.
We study English, not study [vp4,s-] about English.
that [fm3,-s] a person knows a set of grammatical rules and a lot of English words does not mean that he has mastered English.
a [fm3,-s] student's mastery of English is ultimately measured by how well we can use it, not by how much he knows about it.
I be live [fm2,1-] that learning English is just like learning to play the radio.
a [fm3,-s] student of the piano lessons has only one purpose: after practising, he is able to play the piano so you should also here such a purpose: you are able to use English.Using English consists [cc2,2-] of speaking English and writing compositions in English, in order to improve your spoken English.
You'd better take an active part in the teacher's lecturse [fm1,-] answer his questions in English, and try to speak as much as you can aiter [fm1,-] class.
at [fm3,-s] the same time you should listen to and read more English.
I work in a factory which make [vp3,s-] farm machinery.
it [fm3,-s] [wd4,1-2] in Chongping, Sichuom Provinee [fm1,-] .
the [fm3,-s] factory is quite big.
there [fm3,-s] are five workshops.
there [fm3,-s] are over a hundred workers on each shift in every workshop .
and [fm3,-s] there are two big storehouses.
so [fm3,-s] the factory yard is always crowded.
Such as siddes [fm1,-] , hoes and shovds [fm1,-] .
every [fm3,-s] day ships and boats come with saw [fm1,-] materials for the factory and leave with farm machines for cities, town [np6,1-1] and people's communes along the Chang-Jiang [fm2,-] River and the Jialing River.
as [fm3,-s] the factory is a new one, must [fm1,-] of the workers are young people.
Three of the five workshop heads are old workers, one is [wd4,2-2] young man of twenty-two.
The travel Various [wd7,3-3] runs a TV university branch school for young workers and couds [fm1,-] .
they [fm3,-s] learn maths.
chomisty [fm1,-] physics and English, some the only one or two of the four hours [wd7,9-] .
the [fm3,-s] technicians in the Various [wd7,2-1] laboratories help the young worker [np6,-s] in their study during their spare time.There is a dub [wd7,3-3] in every workshop.
my [fm3,-s] father bought a black -white TV set then [wd3,s-] I was five [wd4,2-1] old.
Since then, I've make [vp9,1-] friends with it.
when [fm3,-s] I was a primary school pupil, I liked to match [wd7,3-3] the children's programmes.
the [fm3,-s] interesting stories are very delightful.
though [fm3,-s] [fm1,-] these programmes I knew many important events at home and abroad.
and [fm3,-s] these news broadcasts [np5,2-] became our main topic of talks amony [fm1,-] us.when [fm3,-s] I was 12 [wd4,4-1] old, my father bought a big colour TV set.
the [fm3,-s] colourful and beautiful pictures fascinated me.
how [fm3,-s] glad I was!
Now, I only watched [vp6,3-] the educational programmes and the news, of course of [wd7,2-6] there is a good film on TV.
I was born in Xin xang [fm2,1-] in Henan province [fm3,1-] .
so [fm3,-s] my hometown is Xinxang.
so [fm3,-s] it hasn't many tall buildings .
but [fm3,-s] the things are cheap in here.
How Xinxiang is dire lopping [fm2,3-] quickly and there are some tall buildings had been set up.
some [fm3,-s] streets are built so widely [cc5,2-] , but the cars and buses are dicreasing [fm1,-] .
at [fm3,-s] the evening.
and [fm3,-s] people left [vp6,s] their home and went to the open air.
some people went [vp6,s] to [wd5,3-3] shopping or eating.
There are many school [np3,1-] in Xinxiang and there're two middle are gook [fm1,-] school [np3,4-] in Henan province [fm3,2-] in [fm3,-s] the north of my hometown, there're many beautiful mountains.
because [fm3,-s] we'll build our hometown in future.
a [fm3,-s] dog is a kind of animal, you can find it almost everywhere in the world.
most [fm3,-s] of them are liked by people.
They feed it and build a little house for it, they often play with the dog and teach it how to dance and how to play garmes [fm1,-] .Dogs can help people, because they can watch the door.
In the country, farmers like to keep dogs not only for pleasure, but also for watch [vp4,1-2] the door.
They can heap [wd3,2-4] farmers keep the door, room, gruin [fm1,-] and so on.
In the city, dog [np6,2-s] also help people catch theif [fm1,-] .So dogs are really our friends.
in [fm3,-s] [wd3,-3] an [np7,-2] Santurday [fm1,-] afternoon, all of the students in Grade one [fm3,-] of senior school had an English party.
There were English songs, plays, speech [np6,2-2] and so on.
These pogrammas [fm1,-] were all very good, but the one programme I was interested in was a speech which [wd5,s-] from Zhao Shanshan.
we [fm3,-s] were both interested in English.
I thought it could tell every body [fm2,1-] that my English was better than her .
I had never thought her English would be better, until I had listened [vp1,1-3] her English Speech.
at [fm3,-s] that time, I found she was better.
 [wd4,-s] thought for a long time, I found it wasn't that I want [vp6,s-] enough [cc6,1-1] clever, but I need one thing that she had.
that's [fm3,-s] guts.
if [fm3,-s] a person have [vp3,3-] ability, he wasn't only clever but also have [vp3,s-] guts.
Of [wd3,-s] you haven't guts, you will not find chance to get success.
If you aren't cleaver [fm1,-] enough , you can't stand in the society.
So from now on, I'll work hard, at the same time I'll train my guts [cc3,2-] .
I'm [vp6,-s] be a useful person in the future.
my [fm3,-s] father is only a common person of China.
he [fm3,-s] doesn't know lots of knowledge and also can't speak deep language [cc4,2-] .
father [fm3,-s] is very hard.
his [fm3,-s] family was very poor when he was young, so he had to word [fm1,-] early.
After many years, his face became [vp6,s] very black because of the sun's burning, and his two hands are very rough because of many years of hard work.
In the [wd5,1-1] summer, the weather is so hot.
He still doesn't stop his tow [fm1,-] hands.
In the [wd5,1-1] winter.
The mind [wd3,1-1] blows so large and cold , father's hand [np6,1-1] still continue to do something.
when [fm3,-s] I faced my father, I didn't know what I should do.
I'm sure I didn't describe [wd7,s] my feeling when saw [vp4,s-] the picture.
the [fm3,-s] father who is in the picture, his [pr5,-] thin and black face likes [wd2,s-] my father's very much.
Especially the eyes that is [vp3,s-] full of hope.
He only hope [vp3,2-2] that his children will be useful to the society in the future.
Father's eyes told me that the road of live [wd2,1-] is too long, and also taught me how to walk out my own [wd7,s] the life of road.
a [fm3,-s] young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers .
when [fm3,-s] he got home, he went upstairs to his bedroom and put them on.
He went downstairs, where his mother and his tow [fm1,-] sister [np3m2-1] were washing up the tea thing in the kitchen.
"these [fm3,-s] new trousers are too long," he said, "they [fm3,-s] need shortening by about two inches.
" his [fm3,-s] mother and sister were busy and none of them said anything.
She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.Later in [wd3.1-2] , after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers.
she [fm3,-s] was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly up stairs [fm2,3-1] without saying anything to anyone, and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The young [wd3,d] sister went to the cinema, but when she came in, she too, remembered what her brother had said.
you [fm3,-s] can imagine the look in the young man's face when he put the trousers on the next morning.
I'll never forget- the matter [wd3,-] that I sell books.
I remember that day when it is [vp6,s] July 23nd [fm1,-] 1995.
I collected some all [wd5,2-4] kinds of old books, from my friends and parents.
Decided to go to sell books .at [fm3,-s] 2 o'clock p.m.
I took the books with three of my friends to get to [wd4,2-1] book-market.
we [fm3,-s] put a big piece of paper and put these books on the paper.
after [fm3,-s] a short while our old Book Market was full of people.
"Hill, How [fm3,1-s] much is this book-Beautiful Friend ?
" one [fm3,-s] of the girls asked.
"two [fm3,-s] Juan".
I answer [vp6,d] shyly.
"oh [fm3,-s] , it's old.
after [fm3,-s] all it's my first time to be a seller.
Finally she spend paid [wd5,2-4] only 150 fen for it and went away happily.
" just [fm3,-s] there [wd7,-] a boy with glasses came up.
"what [fm3,-s] can I do for you?
I turned it over and said "you [fm3,-s] see the fice [fm1,-] 3 yuan and you may pay only 2.5 yuan for it.
" "well [fm3,-s] can you make it a little cheaper!
" "sorry [fm3,-] .
but [fm3,-s] it's quite a nice book, isn't it?
" at [fm3,-s] last he paud [fm1,-] 2.5 yuan for it.
soon [fm3,-s] 58 books had been sold and I myself sold 21 of them.
how [fm3,-1] wonderful!
I learned a lot from this practice and it can't be learnal [fm1,-] fool [wd5,4-3] from text books.
What an unforget [fm1,-] take experienle [fm1,-] .
my [fm3,-s] hometown is LinZhou [fm3,-] city.
In town many of [wd5,1-1] people are rich, but the village which is my hometown is very poor.
the [fm3,-s] village next to ShanXi [fm3,-] province [fm3,1-] .
there [fm3,-s] are a lot of hills.
on [fm3,-s] the hills, many flowers and plants are grown.
it [fm3,-s] is [wd4,-3] very beautiful place.
they [fm3,-s] often wear old clothes.
They eat potatoes and drind [fm1,-] porridge.
Last year, 2 [wd7,2-4] went to my hometown.
I met the [np7,d] family.
but [fm3,-s] later.
I like teacher and my [wd1,4-1] classmates.
" the [fm3,-2] girl cried.
"LiLi, you are [wd4,-2] good girl.
But our family was [vp6,d] so poor.
That [wd3,-2] a pity!
I couldn't help crying and I give [vp6,s] them 50 yuan.
I knew [vp6,s] this is very little.
I hope all of [wd5,1-1] people help to [wd5,1-2] the girl.
please [fm3,-s] help that pity girl [cc1,1-] !
one [fm3,-s] day, my brother and I decided to go fishing.
The river wasn't wide, but the nater [fm1,-] was very clear and the river was rich in fishes.
but [fm3,-s] what we saw there surprised us very much.
instead [fm3,-s] we saw rubbish every where [fm2,1-] on the surface of the river floated something dirty and dead fish.What's more, there was a foul smell.
We wondered how fish could lice [wd7,4-3] in such water.
we [fm3,-s] waited and waited.
how [fm3,-s] disappointed we were!
At last we couldn't stand the temible [fm1,-] smell any longer and had to go home.
I [wd3,-3] was awful that with the development of our industry move [wd5,s-] and [wd5,s] more rivers were being polluted.
we [fm3,-s] must do some thing [fm2,1-] to prevent out rivers from being pollnted [fm1,-] .
two [fm3,-s] years ago, I met a boy about seven years old.
he [fm3,-s] was always quiet.
at [fm3,-s] first I thought perhaps he was a quiet boy.
But soon I found he was as clever and aetive [fm1,-] as the other children.when [fm3,-s] the summer holidays were over, I had to go back to my school and he was sent to a school for the handieapped [fm1,-] children.
since [fm3,-s] then I had never seen [vp6,d] him again.
last [fm3,-s] winter I happened to meet him again in the street.
how [fm3,-s] glad we were!
then [fm3,-s] he "told" me that he was interested in drawing.
At last he "told" me a secret [fm3,-s] .
he [fm3,-s] wanted to go to college when he finished middle school!
I'll never forget the day-May 23nd [fm1,-] , when I sold 21 books.
it's [fm3,-s] really an unforgettable experience to me.
Pan Hao, chairman of the students' Urion [fm1,-] , called for us to orgainze [fm1,-] an old Book Market [fm3,s-] , I was the monitor of our class then.
the [fm3,-s] bell rang and school was over.
after [fm3,-s] a short while, our old book market was full of students.
one [fm3,-s] of the girls asked .
"one [fm3,-1] yuan.
"oh [fm3,-s] , it's old.
It's worth 50 for [wd7,3-3] at the most.
finally [fm3,-s] she said [wd3,1-s] only 60 fen for it and went away happily.
looking [fm3,-s] at her, I said to myself, "I must be braver nest time.
"what [fm3,-s] can I do for you?
"ah [fm3,-s] , I want this cartoon book," he said.
I turned it over and said, "you [fm3,-s] see, the price is $2.50 for it [wd5,s-] .
""well [fm3,-s] , can you make it a little cheaper?
" "sorry [fm3,-s] , but it's quite a nice book, isn't it?
" at [fm3,-s] last he paid $2.50 for it.
soon [fm3,-s] after [wd3,-] 58 books had been sold and I myself sold 21 of them.
I learned a lot from this practice and it can't be learned from teat [fm1,-] books.
What an forgetable [fm1,-] experience!

if [fm3,-s] you go to Hong Kong by air .
you [fm3,-s] will arrive at Kat Tak Airport.

LEARNING A LINGUAGE [fm1,-] 
in [fm3,-s] school all over the world boys and girls are learning foreign languages.
It listens to what people say and it tries to imitate what it heard [vp6,s] .
it [fm3,-s] is using the language.
if [fm3,-s] people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly.
But it is not enough only to memerize [fm1,-] rules from a grammar book.
practice [fm3,-s] is important.
we [fm3,-s] must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can.
and [fm3,-s] we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.
one [fm3,-s] day , my brother and I decided to go [vp1,1-1] fish.
some [fm3,-s] years ago we often went fishing by a small river ten kilometors [fm1,-] away from my home.
the [fm3,-s] river wasn't wide but the water was very clear and the river was rich in fishes many fishing fans used to go there for a good catch.
we [fm3,-s] set off very early that merning [fm1,-] .
at [fm3,-s] about seven o'clock we got to the river.
We couldn't find any people there istead [fm1,-] we saw rubbish everywhere.
On the surface of the river twated [fm1,-] something dirty and dead fish.
what's [fm3,-s] more, there was a foul smell.
We wordered [fm1,-] how fish can live in such water.
we [fm3,-s] waited and waited.
how [fm3,-s] disappointed we were!
last [fm3,-s] Saturday, our grade hold [vp6,s] an interesting English Party.
The students who [wd5,2-3] in our grade took part in it.
some [fm3,-s] teachers who taught English in different grades took part in it, too.
In the party, the students who [wd5,s] in different classes give [wd3,s-] us some very good programmes.
Their good programmes make [vp6,s] everyone here very happy and glad.
Sometimes a student should [fm1,-] loudly "well [fm3,-1] .
Done [fm3,1-] !

After that I though [fm1,-] this party is very useful and very good for us.

I hoped it could be hold [vp4,2-] every year.
I hoped it was more better [aj3,1-] and better.
long [fm3,-s] long ago, my hometown was a very beautiful place.
There is [vp6,d] a river which was light [cc4,3-] and had kinds of fishes.
the [fm3,-s] land which was by the side of the river of the soil [wd7,s-] was very good.
people [fm3,-s] lived happily here.
They made the river become dirty and the river went had [wd7,3-] day after day.
they [fm3,-s] cut down trees, so that the soil often [ad1,s-] was washed into river by raining.
At [wd3,-2] a result, the land was to good [wd7,4-2] than before.
everything [fm3,-s] in the town had changed.
The nature was destroied [fm1,-] .many [fm3,-s] years later, a man which [pr5,2-3] was a scientist came here.
At first, the unknown men didn't belive [fm1,-] him, but he didn't give up.
by [fm3,-s] his hard work .
People could belive [fm1,-] him and support him.
then [fm3,-s] the scientist made a fair programme.
A few years later, when the nature become [vp6,s] the best .
If you a boy [wd7,3-1] it.

one [fm3,-s] day a Frenchman went to New York.
he took a taxi to a hotel.the [fm3,-s] day was Sunday.
so [fm3,-s] the Frenchman decided to go out for a walk.
he [fm3,-s] left the hotel and went out into the street.
the [fm3,-s] street was narrow and not very long.
"now [fm3,-s] I know the name of this street, " he said to himself.
"and [fm3,-s] I can get back to the hotel safely.
Then he felt tired and wanted to go bank [fm1,-] to his hotel.
he [fm3,-s] took the notebook out of his pocked and showed the name of the street to a young man .
the [fm3,-s] young man read the words in the Frenchman's notebook and looked at the Frenchman.
" what [fm3,-s] does he want?
he [fm3,-s] stopped an old man and wanted [vp1,-3] him the words in his notebook.
But the old man didn't know that [wd3,s-] the Frenchman wanted.
luckily [fm3,-s] this sailor knew some French.
and [fm3,-s] these were the words in the Frenchman's notebook: one way street.
her [fm3,-s] parents bought it for her when she was eleven years old.
the [fm3,-s] colour was good and she hide [wd7,-s] wearing it very much.
but [fm3,-s] now it is too small to wear it [wd5, s-] .
so [fm3,-s] she want [vp3,1-] to get a man [wd7,1-1] one.
Yesterday she went to shop [np6,1-1] with her mother.
she [fm3,-s] looked at many shirks [fm1,-] , but she was [wd3,d] not like them.
she [fm3,-s] said to her mother," I'll wear this shirt for another year, will you buy me two skirts nest [fm1,-] year"?
She liked a talking tea [wd7,2-] , so Mary bought a small electric machine, it could make tea and bought a small electric machine.
it [fm3,-s] could make tea and then wake you up in the morning.
She brought it is [wd3,s] her mother on her birthday and showed her how to use it.
"before [fm3,-s] you go to bed, put tea and water in it ," she explained to her mother," and don't forget to turn the electricity on.
" Chinese tea is the best tea in the world so many of [wd5,2-1] people like to eat Chinese tea [cc3,2-] , also I like it.
after [fm3,-s] a few days, the old lady telephoned her daughter and said, "Mary, there is one thing I do not understand: why do I have to go to bed to make tea?
can't [fm3,-s] I have tea in the afternoon or in the evening?
WHY DO I PLAY THE CLARICET [fm1,-] 
I have found I had interested [wd2,2-] in playing it.
when [fm3,-s] I was very young, there was a small field by the east to my home .
when [fm3,-s] we had finished our supper, my dad often took me to [wd5,2-1] there, I found my dad often took a strange black things [np3,3-] every times [np3,1-] , and when I was playing, my dad was playing it.
at [fm3,-s] that time, I only knew that it's [wd3,1-3] name is "clarinet".
The actors of the party are [vp6,s-] all the girls in the whole!
If it had the boys were all appered [fm1,-] with another leading players [np3,2-] .
I was very sad at that time, so from then on, I wasn't willing to see the dance, the piano playing or the also [wd7,s-] by girls and so on.
at [fm3,-s] that time, I think [vp6,4-2] "why do the boys couldn't put on [wd4,s-] and act the programmes [cc3,2-] ?......Hmm!
one [fm3,-s] day , I must mount on the stage, and tell the girls: 'the [fm3,-s] boys are also good on the stage!
" when [fm3,-s] I was very young, I had [wd3,1-2] interested in music very much.
At that time, I had no tape but my neighber [fm1,-] had one.
so [fm3,-s] I often went to his home and listened to the music.
my [fm3,-s] mother found I had interested in it.

that [fm3,-s] many be so .One day "doing...... the alarm of the clock wake [vp6,s-] me up.
On my way to school it began to rain hard.When I got to the door of the [wd5,3-3] our class room .
I was all wit [wd3,3-3] and shivering with cold.
our [fm3,-s] mathes [fm1,-] teacher had already gegun [fm1,-] his lesson.
It was a Mr Wu he [pr1,-] was about fifty years old.
" With these words he quickly took off his own jacket and quickly handed it to me "Now take off your wet coat and put this one on to [wd5,-] you'll get ill?
he [fm3,-s] said kindly.I went to my seat with my teachers [np4,1-1] jacket it was a bit big for me but I felt very warm in it to my surprise, I found for the first time, mathes [fm1,-] was [wd5,1-3] became so interesting and how well I couldn't forgot it.

when [fm3,-s] you don't understand it [pr3] , you can try to guess the meaning from the rest of the sentence.
" I heard what he said and then asked, "but [fm3,-s] how to use [wd4,2-2] English language?

he [fm3,-s] said, "Marx could master many foreign language [np3,2-] .
in [fm3,-s] one of his books .
if [fm3,-s] they do this, it shows they haven't mastered it.
when [fm3,-s] they use the foreign language, they should try to forget all about their own.
if [fm3,-s] they cannot do this, they have not really learned the spirit of the foreign language and cannot use it freely.

the [fm3,-s] Chinese people will never forget the biggest earthquake in Tang shan [fm2,1-] , in 1976.
houses [fm3,-s] and tall buildings fell down.
I was having my summer holidays with my uncle in Tang shan [fm2,1-] .
my [fm3,-s] uncle got me out at once.
but [fm3,-s] our neighbours were not as lucky as we were.
they [fm3,-s] were killed in the earthquake.today [fm3,-s] , we have rebuilt Tang shan [fm2,1-] and made it more beautiful.
but [fm3,-s] I do hope we can do some thing [fm2,1-] later to stop earthquakes.
one [fm3,-s] day, my brother and I decided to go fishing.
Some years ago we after [wd5,1-s] went fishing by a small river ten kilometers away from my home.
had [fm3,-s] [wd7,-s] the river was rich in fishes.
but [fm3,-s] what we saw there surprised us very much.
We could [wd4,d] fund [fm1,-] any 0eople [fm1,-] there.
instand [fm1,-] [fm3,-s] we saw rubbish every where [fm2,1-] .
On the surface of the river floated some thing [fm2,1-] dirty and dead fish.
how [fm3,-s] disappouned [fm1,-] we were!
It was awful that with the derelopment [fm1,-] of our industry, more and more rivers were being polluted .
we [fm3,-s] must do something to prevent our rivers from being polluted.
when [fm3,-s] I was young, I'd listen to the radio, waiting for my favorite songs.
When they played I'd sing along [cc5,1-] , it make [vp6,s-] me smile.Those were such happy times and not so long ago.
how [fm3,-s] I wondered where they'd gone.
It can really make my [pr4,1-1] cry.
just [fm3,-s] like me.
Looking back on how it was in years gone by , and the good tomes [wd7,3-3] that I had makes today seen [wd7,s-] rather sad.
so [fm3,-s] much has changed.
Now I changed [vp6,s] [wd4,-] a serious girl, with out [fm2,1-] smile on my face.
I hoped [vp6,-s] that I could go back to before, but I can't.
what [fm3,-s] should I do?

it [fm3,-s] gave me a good idea.
Now, I change [vp6,-] [pp1,-] a ripe girl.
my [fm3,-s] life are [vp3,2-3] full of live [wd2,-] .
THE FAMOUS [wd4,-] OF WOULDS [fm1,-] 
there [fm3,-s] are three of the biggest man-made projects in the would [fm1,-] .
they [fm3,-s] are the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt and the Aswan High Dam which is also in Egypt.First, the Great Wall of China was built during the Qi and the Ming periods.
In those periods, the Emperox [fm1,-] and Empress had made lots of labour force to build the defence line in order to resist the foreign invader [np6,s-] .
They didn't know the live [wd2,2-3] of the people in country city [cc1,-] , town and village [np6,2-] .After that, many peasant [np3,1-] had rase [fm1,-] up during [pp1,-] every year.
What a pity [cc7,2-2] of them!
because [fm3,-s] of the wars during the period, most of the Qi Wall was distoried [fm1,-] by people.
during [fm3,-s] the Ming period, the Emperor made [vp1,-5] people building the great Wall.
so [fm3,-s] the Great Wall which you looked [vp6,s-] at is bigger and longer then [fm1,-] the Qi Great Wall.
today [fm3,-s] , the Great Wall was [vp6,s-] from Shan hai [fm2,1-] to Jia yu [fm2,1-] .
there [fm3,-s] are lots of nations people [cc1,1-] lived [vp6,s-] there and they were growing many plants for their life.
I love the Great Wall, because it solidified the wisdom and hard-working [wd2,s-] of the Chinese.
everybody [fm3,-s] , I think you all know the Chinese history.
yes [fm3,-s] , China is a very.
very great country, which is one of the oldest of fours [wd7,-] in the world.
now [fm3,-s] , I want to talk some thing [fm2,1-] about China.
At [wd5,-4] about 1,700,000 years ago Chine [fm1,-] had already had the people, which were called Yuan Mou [fm2,1-] people.
as [fm3,-s] their life, it was lasted [vp7,s-] very long time.In the 2100s BC, one people who called [vp7,s-] Qi had built [wd4,3-2] Xia period [wd3,3-] , which was the first period [wd3,s-] in China.
it [fm3,-s] was the first slavery country.
It disappeared in about 770- 476BC, which contained [wd4,-1-5] Xia, sheng [fm3,1-2] Zhou periods [wd3,s-] and so on.in [fm3,-s] the [wd5,1-2] 475-221 BC, China built the other period [wd3,s-] , which [wd4,1-3] called [vp7,s-] Zhan Guo [fm2,1-1] period [wd3,2-] .
it [fm3,-s] was the first Feng Jian [fm2,1-1] country.
in [fm3,-s] 230- 221 AD, Yeng Zheng destroued [fm1,-] others [wd2,1-1] country [np3,s-] , and built the first whole country, which called [vp7,s-] [wd4,1-1] Qin period [wd3,2-] .
He was believed the greater politcal [fm1,-] leader.
At last, the Feng Jian [fm2,1-] period disappeared at the [wd5,1-2] 1912 AD.
The last period [wd3,-s] was [wd4,1-2] Qing period [wd3,2-] .
So the Feng Jia [fm2,1-] society was the longest time [wd5,s-] in Chinese history, which contained [wd4,2-6] Qin, Han, Shang, Ming, Yuan, Qing period [np6,s-] [wd3,s-] and so on.
on [fm3,-s] [wd3,-s] the world there is no country as the [wd5,3-1] China.what [fm3,-s] a great country!

A lot of gratulations [fm1,-] have become famous people.
Many trees surround the building [np6,d] of [wd4,2-1] school.
The school have [vp3,1-] two teaching building [np3,2-] and a lab building.
At [wd3,-4] the May 14th afternoon, a student of senior two picked up a pair of blue sport trousers on the play ground.
There is a wallet on [wd3,-s] one pocket and keys on [wd3,s-] the other.
He handed [wd4,1-5] [vp1,1-5] in the office of senior two.
What could you think of expect [vp1,2-3] the cool water .
I'll think of the sea what [pr5,s-] colour is blue and very bright and clean.
When I think of blue, the sky will appear on [wd3,s-] my head.
This term had started [wd3,s-] for three weeks.
 [cc5,0-5] Our learning is very busy.
But I still very missed [cc5,1-] my old friends.
We had taoked [fm1,-] for a long time.
Next week we will have several [np6,2-0] test.
This Monday we had had a phisical [fm1,-] test.
So in the four [np6,1-1] day's holiday, I'll try my best to grasp the knowledge and keep up with other classmates.
In fact, my birthday had [vp4,3-3] past for several months.
For some reasons, my good friend [ad1,3-3] only can give me the present these days.
Because our friendship isn't [vp4,1-2] build by present, but it's very ture [fm1,-] and pure.
Tomorrow -- Oxtober [fm1,-] 1 is our National day.
Everybody in China [vp3,3-1] know this.
October 6 Friday Rainy It was raining hard when I went to school this morniong [fm1,-] .
I was wearing [np6,3-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with short [np6,3-3] sleeve at that time.
I [vp1,1-3] felt it very cold.
When I got to the classroom, I found that many of my classmates were wearing [np6,1-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with long [np6,5-0] sleeve.
thought:" Why didn't I wear [np6,1-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with long [np6,2-0] sleeve?
After a while, the classmate who sat by my side [vp6,6-4] take off her outer clothing and said: "Would you like to put on my clothing?
" She began to find [wd3,3-0] .
A miunte [fm1,-] later, she found it out.
But I remembered that I [vp6,3-3] haven't brought my ticke [fm1,-] .
 [fm3,-] she said:" Don't worry about this, you can go and find Mr Zhu if you won't go into the theater.
I must try to remember everything [fm1,-] .
The sports meet [vp3,3-3] were had [wd3,4-2] this morning.
When the sports meet started, people were even [wd3,-] excited.
The first track and field [np6,5-1] events [vp3,1-0] was run the 100-metre dash.
 [fm3,-] the girl who [vp7,2-2] named Lin Minghua of our class won the champion.
Then the girls of our class [wd4,6-5] did well in the match: Our monitor named Xuan Yunsheng won [wd4,1-1] third place in the 200-metre dash.
Comparison [wd3,-] between the boys and the girls in our class, the boys wasn't so good as the girls.
I hope the boys [vp9,4-2] must not [vp7,4-0] discourage, but try to do better.
A match [wd3,1-4] which test our knowledge, our reaction, our strategy was had [wd3,1-3] this Monday afternoon.
What kind was the match [wd7,4-0] ?
This was a match [wd3,3-5] about the knowledge on history.
It was the first activity that [vp4,4-3] be had [wd3,2-5] by the Communist Youth League.
 [fm3,-] the question was not so difficult that each group can answer fundamentally.
The second part was the question that [vp7,3-2] anticipated to answer.
The girl in our group who [vp7,6-2] named Li Xiaojun depended on her own actual strength so that our grade [vp4,2-4] be in a higher place.
But a boy who [wd4,3-2] in [fm3,-] group [fm3, -] three was very good at history.
A group must choose a question to [wd3,-] each group among [np6,0-5] the [fm3,-] grade 10, 20 or 30.
At last, our group won the champion in the match [wd7,8-0] .
 [cj1,0-4] While I don't like it.
When I studied at junior middle [np6,3-0] school, I became [wd2,2-3] loathing rain very much.
So the students had to show their beautiful legs --rolled up their bottom of the trousers legs [wd5,1-0] , took off their shoes and socks, [vp1,0-2] waded the "river".
If they wouldn't be careful, they would [wd7,1-2] plus a "printing" on their sole.
The watter [fm1,-] on the road was spattered on my treasured trousers.
It always [vp3,2-2] make me unhappy.
It as to chorus a song which [vp7,1-4] named The [fm3,-] brink of [fm3,-] love and [fm3,-] pain.
It was our turn, my [fm3,-] classmate and I [vp6, 7-3] get on the stage.
At the same time, I saw my classmates who under the stage began to brandish their [np6,1-0] torch.
They all handed in hand [cc3,2-] and [vp6,4-1] lift them, [vp5,2-5] followed the rhythm and wave.
They can make us see the [wd1,1-3] all fine things in the world.
And [pr1,1-5] it'll live in a black world.
If you are [wd2,3-0] nearsightedness, then you'll be [wd1,3-3] not able to see the distinct things without glasses.
And [vp1,1-3] look [vp1,-2] more the [wd5.1-1] plants.
I like singing, writing, taking a photo, drawing... [fm3,-] Because I think [vp5,2-1] take photos and [vp5,3-2] draw pictures can retain the beautiful scenery.
And [vp5,1-3] sing songs, [wd4,2-2] [vp5,2-1] write can make things even better.
So in this art festival, I enter for several [np6,1-0] item: [vp5,2-1] take photos, [vp5,2-4] sing a song, and calligraphy.
But I [vp6,2-8] take photos for the first time, I often worried about if I can do well in it.
In fact, I think everyone should be broadminded.If we [fm1,-] an do this, we'll be happy [wd4,3-1] whatever time.
Beacuse [fm1,-] she made this wedding dress with 130 white rubbish sack.

And the people who was stupid or unfit for his office would not [wd4,2-3] able to see the cloth.
The Emperor was very pleased to [wd3,-] the message.

After some tome, the [fm3,-] Emperor sent others to look at the cloth.But they could see nothing.
At last the [fm3,-] Emperor himself went to see the cloth with a few of his officials.
But [fm3,-] they all pretended they saw the beautiful cloth including the [fm3,-] Emperor himself.
The [fm3,-] Emperor [vp6,2-3] walk along the street with the new clothes.
In fact, he had nothing oin [fm1,-] .
But nobody dared say the fact until a little child said: But [fm3,-] he has nothing on!
" The emperor heard he [pr4,2-4] cried and felt very silly.
This is the first Christmas [wd3,5-5] that I left my old friends.

It [vp7,1-7] made in [wd3,1-] a piece of golden hard paper.
A piece of white cellophane paper is [vp7,7-2] [vp1,7-2] covered with it.
On the white cellophane paper, [vp3,0-3] there's some special characters.
The whole card looks very [cc4,5-0] well.
But the reason that [wd5,3-3] why I like the card isn't its surface, , it only because it was [fm2,-] send from my good friend!
She knew this, and wrote a lot of [np6,4-0] word.
She said she would [wd4,2-7] always at the same side with me.
I felt that [wd4,3-4] had a bosom friend is the luckiest thing.

At night, the sea [vp3,2-1] become mysterious.

I think when we have questions and don't understand the meaning of the text, we must [vp8,1-4] be asking the teacher, If we can do this, we will grasp [vp1, 2-2] much better.
This is one of the studying's [np4,5-1] ways.

Long long [wd6,-] ago there were an Emperor and his foolish ministers.
He really care [vp6,2-5] more for his new clothes.
He tried them on [wd4,3-3] a long time every day [wd5,1-1] morning.
They said that thay [fm1,-] was [vp3,3-3] able to weave clothes of the more [aj3,s-] beautiful colors and designs [cc3,11-3] in the world, they also said that the clothes would be invisible to anyone who [wd4,3-5] either stupid or unfit for his office .
The cheats took [vp1,2-9] some gold and silk from the Emperor to theirselves [fm1,-] .
In face [fm1,-] , they worked at the empty looms.
Then the emperor and his ministers went to see the [wd5,-] the cloth, though they lay [vp6,1-] nothing, they were in order not to let anyone else know this.
They also said that they would [vp8,5-4] see the beautiful colors.
The Emperor was even fooler [wd2,s-] [aj3,4-5] to walk in the porcession [fm1,-] with nothing on.
At last only a child spoke [vp2,0-3] out the truth.
This is the story that talk [vp7,5-1] about.
It is [vp6,1-4] Chistmas [fm1,-] tomorrow.
But Christmas is not be [wd5, 3-3] noticed [wd3,6-2] in Chinese [wd2,10-0] .
so [fm3,-] we don't have holidays.
The North Chonutries' people [np1,5-0] are very happy in Christmas and the Children [fm3,-] will take [wd3,5-6] presents from their mother and father, sooner and later, Christmas from the North Chonutries [fm1,-] to China.

It will be New [np7,0-2] Year's Day tomorrow.
All the people are very pleased, the old year was passed [vp7, 4-0] , All the streets and shops and the parts [fm1,-] that there were many people.
I couldn't help thinking [vp1,3-9] a lot of things and much [np8,0-1] hope .hope that in the new year, I will make rapid progresses [np5,2-0] and my falimies [fm1,-] are happy.
Mr. Zhu wanted to let us master [wd3,2-3] the lesson's words.
But the test's [np4,1-1] result wasn't [wd3,3-4] make anyone fell [fm1,-] satisfily [fm2,-] .I made many mistakes in this test So I was in class [np7,11-0] .
I didn't [wd5,1-19] think that I have studied in school for evrel [fm1,-] years, but I couldn't write so many words.
this really let [wd3,2-2] anybody laugh.
I asked myself, if I could put my heart into listening and when I went over the texts, I was more carefully [wd2,3-0] .
This thing [wd5,1-2] wasn't [vp6, 4-1] happening.
We also had mathes' [np4,0-3] and physics' test.
Many subjects already finished [vp7,3-0] , the teachers began to go [vp1,4-3] over for us .
We'll have examination [np6,2-3] in this term in a mouth.
I think the physics and mathes is [vp3,3-] more It's [pr1,8-2] not diffiult [fm1,-] , It's not easy to study them well.
Perhaps I took much [wd3,-] time to do exercises about them.
So I was bad [wd3,2-4] in this Chinese test.
But I don't discovery [wd2,2-0] .
I'll do my best to think over [vp2, 6-6] the good studying [np1,2-1] ways.
The coming [wd7,1-3] procession was end [wd2,6-0] , the Emperor got back and he was very angry.
You try [vp1,1-7] on sevrel [fm1,-] times in fron [fm1,-] of me, and you must [vp8, 1-7] care about your kingdom and your people.
" To his surprise, the mirror isappeared [fm1,-] .
He care  [vp6,1-6] about his kingdom and his people.
And the kingdom [wd7,1-9] and of [wd5,5-7] the people was [vp3, 10-4] very kind to him.

I hope that Mr Zhu will be able to change my seat again after one or two [wd7,-] .
Because he said he will [vp6,3-3] change the seat every three [wd7,8-0] .
In this way trees clean the air so the [fm1,-] we breathe.
With their roots and leaves, trees stop [wd3,1-10] strong wind and swift rain water from taking away soil [np7,1-] .
Many people grow flowers in the couryard [fm1,-] or in their gardons [fm1,-] while they were planted in blosssom [fm1,-] , some people put them indoors as decoration Flowers add [vp4,8-8] beauty to the envirionment [fm1,-] and urily [fm3,-] the air.

But he felt very lonely,he had no friends except an old dog that only made him feel fortunately [cc5,1-0] .
He often worried about the footmark and desided [fm1,-] to go back to go [vp1,12-1] through.
He looked at the footprint, realizing there must be somebody in [wd3,0-2] the ailand [fm1,-] , then he returned home with [wd5,3-3] full of fear.
 [wd4,0-12] looked for a better hiding-flace [fm2,-] in order to defence [fm1,-] his enemy.He stepped into the cave, it was darker and darker, Suddenly he saw two eyes glaring at him, he left at once.

Nobody [wd4,1-2] in the house so [cj2,6-9] that I climb [vp1,1-6] up the window to take it.
The window didn't close [vp7,s-] .
I closed the door and went downstairs, then I found hat I had gotten [wd3,-1] to take umbrella.

Sunday Nov MoL [fm1,-] 
I borrowed a novel named Jane Eyre from Miss Lin, which writed [fm2,-] [vp7,1-3] in simple English.
I spent several hours to [vp2,4-3] read it today.
To my joy, the heroine master [wd5,1-4] found her own love, love and lover became couple.
The plot probably [wd4, 4-0] very simple.
Though I finished reading, tender [cc6,-2] not enough.
So I decided to read the complete translation in this summer holoday [fm1,-] .
She is one of my good friends among [pp1,0-4] the past three years.
From the interchange [wd3,-] , we can know each other's study and life as well as before .
Between [pp1,0-4] the past three years, in the old school we always helped each other on [vp2,5-4] study as a classmate [np3,9-0] .
And after class, we would have heart-to-heart talks as a good friend [np3,8-0] .
To [pp2,0-2] this time, I understood the meaning of "A friend indeed is a friend in need.
A few days ago, when I was hurring [fm1,-] to go home, my bike suddenly broke down I must get it repaired.
I was worring [fm1,-] what to do, Just then a student whom I did not know passed by, She gave me a five yuan note and hurried away.
Here [fm3,-] was no time for me to ask her name and which school she was in.
I love plum blossoms, though [wd4,5-3] have never seen it.
Because from anuent [fm1,-] to modern, countless great writer [np3,2-0] enjoyed it and writes a lot of poems and words win umiversal [fm1,-] praise to eulogize [fm1,-] it.
In the [np7,1-1] history, plum blossoms was ever elected to [vp1,5-6] be the flower of our country.
So I have a dream, that [wd4,4-8] I will see it with my own eyes.
The new teachers went away in [pp1,0-1] Friday.
All of us didn't want [vp1,4-2] them left.
We liked them very much and looked [vp1,0-4] them as our friends.
Many classmates couldn't keed [fm1,-] [vp8,3-3] back their tears too [wd3,9-0] .
At last, Mr Yang said to us: "We were [vp6,1-4] so thanks [wd2,5-2] for you .
You're our first students in our teacher's lefe [fm1,-] .
Though they left, we would usually [wd3,2-5] think [vp1,3-2] them again.
So the [np7,0-8] doctor makes money only if we are sick.
Consequently isn't it in the doctor's interest to wish everybody were [vp3,4-1] sick so e can make a lot of money?
I think doctors should only make money if we are healthy, [wd4,0-1] this way it would be in his interest to keep us healthy.
A national insurance program, I think, would achieve this resule [fm1,-] [cc3,2-0] since doctors can then be encouraged to prevent sickness from occuring [fm1,-] [vp7,3-0] .
Sports is good for [pp1,3-1] us.
It is very interesing [fm1,-] and exciting.
When I is [wd3,1-2] playing it, I fell [fm1,-] very happy and it can improve friendship.
Because it must [vp8,6-4] require [vp1,4-3] to cooperate well.
I like watch [vp1,2-2] basketball match.
The programme name NBA is very welcome [wd3,6-0] .
Sports can keep us healthy, I will always [wd4,-1] sport.
The Moving [np2,1-1] Star The moving [np2,1-1] star is the only star which we can watch it moves with our own eyes.
It often appears in Summer [fm3,-] and Autumn [fm3,-] .
It is heart [vp2,2-3] that the wishes which promise [vp7,3-4] to the moving [np2,1-1] star will be realized.
I am very regreted [vp7,2-] that I have never caught sight of it.
But I think I will watch it in the future, at that time I will promise [cc3,0-2] my wish.
This story of the play happened in [wd3,0-3] a professor's home.
He always forget [vp6,2-6] sth [fm2,-] unimportant, but remember [vp6,10-4] sth [fm2,-] important.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning beacause [fm1,-] he had just finished the papers of his invention.
The men will [vp6,2-5] take his paper to London and then Professor Hunter will [wd4,2-4] [vp6,2-2] very famous and the invention will [vp6,2-5] greatly benefit the whold [fm1,-] world.
They kidnapped the true [wd3,3-1] men and took away their cards.
But Mr Hunter told them not to worry because he knew the true [wd2,3-0] at first and gave the men's paper were other papers.

 [s8,s] Time is money for me.
I learned too bad [adj1,1-] for all the subject.

If you have many [np8,4-1] money, then you will have anything.
On the contrary, you have no money, so all the person [np6,4-2] were coldly.
My frist [fm1,-] teacher I'm sixteen years old now.
During my studying [wd3,3-1] life, there are [vp6,2-2] many teacher [wd6,4-] .
I want to say [wd3,4-4] about my first teacher.
In the Primary [fm3,-] School [fm3,-] , Miss Zhong was my class head [fm2,-] .
She is [vp6,2-3] a young woman.
In the first time [pp2,3-] , she told us she was thirty years old that year.
In the years that followed, we knew that he [wd3,1-] taught Chinese and she always was very kind of [wd3,6-1] us.
In the following two years, she never angrily [wd2,3-2] for [wd3,4-1] us.
To we were Great [fm1,-1] Three, Miss Zhong left us.
We stated [fm1,-] to know some new teachers.
In the Spring Holiday [np6,3-] , she asked me to her office at once.
She gave me some cards and said "Happy new [fm3,-] year [fm3,-] " to me.
Everything time [cc1,1-] I was happily [wd2,3-] and thankful.
She was still kind of [wd3,5-2] her pupils and more beautiful .
For this Summer Holiday, today is [vp6,2-3] the second day.
So I phone [vp6,s-] all my old school friends.
At the same time, I met John, my goods [fm1,-] friend for ten years.
We were [wd3,2-6] hand by hand [np2,3-] into it [pr1,1-] together.
We could see the wated [fm1,-] was green and clear.
Some friend [np6,2-] couldn't help jumping and laughing, they jumped into it at once .The others went to get some foods [np5,1-] and soft-drinks, put them near the swimming pool.
At last, we were jumped [wd5,3-3] into the water at all.
About two years [wd3,3-1] late [wd3,4-] ,we felt tired and hungry, so some were had a rest and said something to together.
Today, Everything [fm3,-] was beautiful.
She said the [wd5,1-] she will gave [vp6,3-3] me a happiness [wd3,1-] .
So I was surprise [wd2,-] .
I want [fm1,-] to her home at once.
At this time [wd3,3-] , my friend came out, [fm3,-] She asked me with a smile "What do you think?
My friend told me that the dog was sent [wd3,4-4] by her brother's friend.
he liked sleep [wd2,3-] on people's legs and alway [fm1,-] took the books on the floor.
Because he was only two years old, he must to [wd5,1-] drink milk.

It [pr1,1-] likes used [vp5,-] the tail to say good-bye to me.
In the shop, it [pr1,1-] became large and more modernary [fm1,-] .
In the windows of children's clothes, some perents [fm1,-] with their children looked through the windows.
Their children always [wd5,3-5] ran and jump around it.
They picked out [wd5,1-] the latest modes [wd3,3-] of [wd3,1-1] them and told their father or mother.
Everyday they came [vp6,3-2] here early.
Some are buying something, some are seeing [wd3,3-] , some are the boss .
I find that the clothes [wd4,2-4] more beautiful than before.
Of course some are much [wd3,3-1] expensive.
So they never make them disappointed together [wd3,-] .
China's four modenizations [fm1,-] will be reality [np7,-] .
People's living conditions is [vp3,4-1] improving.
We belive [fm1,-] that our country must [vp9,3-2] be lovely [cc6,-1] better in the future.
The new term have [vp3,4-1] come [vp6,5-3] [wd3,5-] three weeks ago.
As we grew up, we can [vp9,2-1] feel knowledge is very important for every one.
We can [vp9,2-1] know that we would [wd4,2-2] very busy in the coming days.
First, we must go to school in the evening though it rains hardly [wd3,3-] , and on Saturday -- the weekend, we must also to [wd5,1-] go o school all day long.
You can find a lot of students study [vp5-] harder than before.

Today, I phoned [wd5,1-1] called my goods [fm1,-] friend -- the old classmate of the Primary School.
We have not seen [wd3, 4-4] for a long time.
So today, we felt having many words but could not say something [wd3,1-] .
He said [wd3,2-3] about the person [np6,2-] and something [wd3,1-3] we had remembered.
Much [np8,1-4] of the old classmates had changed.
We remembered what happed [fm1,-] between us all those day [np6,2-] .
Though the [wd5,1-1] time pass [vp6,4-1] by.
We [fm3,-] felt many [wd3,3-5] of the felling [fm1,-] have changed [vp3,8-2] each other, but we could not forget [wd4,-] "we are [vp6,2-2] good friends.
" We never said "forever", but we both know [vp6,4-] that the friend-ship [fm1,-] grows [vp6,3-3] up [wd5,4-2] with us, with the following [wd3,3-1] days.
Yesterday, I read an account [wd3,4-] that teach [vp6,4-1] people how to write with a pen on paper.
I felt that it is [vp6,2-1] useful for me after I read it.
First, It taugh [fm1,-] us how to pick a [np7,1-1] ordinary pen for writing.
It said that a thicker pen fiter [fm1,-] more than the [wd5,1-1] others.

Not only at [pp2,-2] the class, but also after class.
o the boy [wd3,3-4] was a beautiful watch, and to [wd3,3-4] the girl was a lovely toy.
As the teacher's [np4,3-1] letter was read in the class.
I think all the person [np6,3-3] are [wd5,6-2] have feeling [np6,6-] .
Nobody likes "Good-bye [fm3,-] ' But it was the ality [fm1,-] for us.
So we must keep back our tears at the quick speed [cc4,3-] ,and study harder than before.
When you [wd4,2-4] in the swimming-pool, you [wd4,1-3] through the water, the feeling was [vp6,3-1] good, you will feel soft.

 [wd4, 1-] professor smiled and said, the papers that [wd4,3-2] give vp6,4-1] them were wrong.
The papers of his invention were still in [wd3,8-2] his desk.
Finally, [wd4,-1] professor decided to take the papers to London himself.
My English was not well [wd2,5-] .
My English's [pr4,-] base [wd3,3-2] was bad.
I am used to [vp2,4-3] forget the words, and it is difficulty [wd2, 3-2] to grasp the grammer [fm1,-] and some of the idioms for me.
For example, Once, I kept up my mind [vp2,5-3] to read aloud the text every morning.
It took me about ten to fifteen munites [fm1,-] .
This situation lasted seaval [fm1,-] days.
In [wd3,1-3] the fifth day , I felt that is [vp6,4-2] too much for me, So I didn't stick to it.
Lazy [wd2,15-] is my the [wd5,1-] most [wd3,1-1] shortcoming.
I thought that [wd4,3-1] must be [wd5,1-] get rid of it.
otherwise, [fm3,-] it must [vp9,2-4] effect me very much.
My Winter Holiday [np6,3-] 
The winter holiday [np6,3-3] was very short.
It is [vp6,2-4] at least [wd3,-] two weeks.
Except [wd3,1-3] the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , it is [vp6,2-3] about seven days to study.
I know [vp6,2-] that is [vp6,2-3] the important time for us to study.
Teathers [fm1,-] often said that study n fact is [vp6,3-1] this.
In this holiday, I often remember [wd3,-] to go over my lessons.
I noticed everyone studies [vp6,4-2] very hard in the days before this holiday.
But I found that is [vp6,2-4] the most important thing to do everything is [vp6,2-1] hard.
So after the test, they could smiled [vp6,1-] aloud [cc5,4-] from their hearts.
Although I was [vp6,2-3] not very clever, I will go on to study hard in this term.
The Spring Festerval [fm1,-] 
At [wd3,1-2] the night before "The Spring Festerval [fm1,-] ",my perant [np6,2-] [fm1,-] ,and me walk [vp6,5-3] [wd3,5-3] "the flower street".

Some are [vp6,2-1] red, some are [vp6,2-1] yellow, some are [vp6,2-4] green and so on.
Although the night was raining , [cc2,2-] people much more than before .
In [wd3,1-2] the Festerval [fm1,-] , I stayed at home almost every day.
Because the whether was very cold and I wanted to [wd4,3-2] in bed instead.
But I phone [wd5,2-1] call [vp6,2-2] my friends to say "Happy new [fm3,-] year [fm3,-] !
At my home, it is [vp6,2-2] very warm, I was lazy to out .
Sometimes, my old school friends called [vp1,-] me, and said some beautiful words to me.
It is [vp6,2-4] much happier for me.
I wish all the people who I knew "Happy new [fm3,-] year [fm3,-] ".
Before the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , my friend do [vp6,3-1] [wd3,3-1] shopping with me.
Many flowers and oranges was [vp3, 57-] put at the gate of the shops.
It [pr1,1-3] looked beautiful.
In the shops, my friends and me wanted to buy something, but all the things [wd4,3-2] very expensive.
For the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , we must buy some clothes or anything else.
At the end of the time [pp1,5-] , we bought much [wd3,3-1] something [wd3,-] to eat after [wd5,1-1] all [wd5,1-] .
We jumped, ran, smiled aloud [cc5,2-] in the street.
At the age of seventeen, it [wd5,1-4] is the beautiful [aj3,s-] age of [wd3,4-] every one.
We will remember this age at [wd3,1-2] our life.
I remembered the days that my old school friends had played at [wd3,1-2] the streets and roads with me liked at that time.
At the day [wd3,-] , we were all younger than today.
At the end of this holiday, tomorrow [wd7,-4] will go to school, the term will be begun [vp1,5-] .
At this [pr1,-] time, I feel excited and a little frightened.
 [fm1,-] I read the words one by one.
I could [vp9,2-1] know that would be [wd5,3-3] become my knowledge.I read the texts louder [cc5,5-4] as nobody [wd4, 1-2] near me.
I was careful in it [pr1,5-] .
Sometimes, I turn on the radio and listen to the songs or the DJ's voice voice [wd5,1-] .
It can make me mopre [fm1,-] relaxing [aj4,4-] then ever.
Wxpecially [fm1,-] the songs of [wd3,3-1] Englilsh [fm1,-] .
Altough [fm1,-] some of them I could not understand all about it.
"Say you, say me","Right here waiting" "Unchained Melody" "Nothing's gonna change my love for you" "Casablance [fm1,-] " and so on.
In the years that followed I wish everyday [cc3,3-3] happier than ever.
With times [np5,2-2] go [vp4,3-1] by, our study has become [cc2,4-3] busier and busier.
All of the students [fm1,-] in our grade have studied [vp6,9-5] harder and harder than ever.

Sometime [wd3,0-4] I did my homework, sometime [wd3,0-5] I watched TV, sometime [wd3,0-6] I played table tennis with friend [np6,5-0] .
Usually I get up at seven thirty in the morning and then go out to swim, but I would do morning exercise or run a few second [np3,3-2] before swimming.
About at nine, this [pr1,3-4] is my breakfast's time.

Rainny [fm1,-] 
It is [vp6,1-5] three weeks since term began.
We came back [wd4,3-1] our school to study [cc3,8-3] new knowledge again.
So we have a study at school at night [np1,1-4] of Monday to Friday and Saturday.
Because this can be study more carefully than past by us and prevent us from watching TV at home at night .I decided to spend these time [np3,5-12] to study harder and do my best to get the good mark.
Friday of last week is [vp6,4-3] Mid- Autumn Day.
I ate the moon cake and go [vp1,6-7] [vp6,6-5] in front of the window, I saw the moon is very bright.
I felt [vp1,1-4] the moon extra right.
At that time, here and there are [vp6,6-4] [vp1,6-2] very silent.
Because people is [vp3,2-4] seeing the moon now.
This evening I was happy, wish [vp4,5-2] you too.

When they came [vp1,2-2] our school, I thought can they teach us well .
though [fm3,-] I thought so, I have lesson listened carefully, too .
during [pp1,0-8] [fm3,-] they gave a lesson for us, many teachers sat in the classroom and [wd5,8-2] behind me.
So we had lessons silent [wd2,4-0] .
I felt they talk [wd3,3-6] [vp6,3-4] better than I supposed.
In the three weeks, I wish we will [vp1,3-5] get on well with them.
I remember before [pp1,2-4] the sports meeting [wd2,-] began.
Every morning, some students in our school came to school very early, and do [vp6,13-3] the match exercise on the playground because the time of the match was more and more fast [aj3,10-0] and they hoped that they got the good mark in it.

But at half past ten, two man [np3,1-0] came for the paper.
Professor knew that they were impostors through talking [vp1,7-1] about.
So professor [np6,1-6] only gave them some other papers, and they took a quick look and accept [vp6,7-1] them.
Shortly after that, the polic [fm1,-] telephoned and told that the two government [wd3,10-4] aren't the right man [np3,16-0] .After the policman [fm1,-] heard from the professor, they also went out.

At last, I went out [wd4,1-3] the book store.
I believed I can [vp6,3-9] find the picture and finish my homework before Wednesday.
It is [vp6,1-7] three days since the winter holiday began.
This winter Holiday, I prepare to study at home besides [wd3,9-6] three days of the Spring Festival.
Every day [wd5,1-1] morning I get up at seven thirty, and then go out to run a few seconds.
About [ad1,0-2] at nine, this [pr1,5-4] is my breakfast's time.
Frome [fm1,-] one to two, I will have a rest.
Then I continued [vp6,2-11] my homework carefully for a little time.
When supper is over, I read newspapers know [vp4,3-10] about some event of the country, and improve [vp4,13-2] my knowledge.
When I think [vp2,2-1] this, I feel very happy.
Though a few days in the future are the Spring Festival, I have important task [np6,14-0] .

But this Spring Festival, my family bought a lot of flowers for example: chrysanthemun [fm1,-] ,... narcissue [fm1,-] .These are very beautiful.
This Spring Festival, on my way home to my uncle, somebody pat [vp6,11-6] me on he shoulder frome [fm1,-] behind.
I look [vp6,1-6] back.
Jun Ying is [vp6,2-5] my classmate five years ago, and we are good friends now, she was studying in another middle school.
We are talk [vp4,2-5] a lot of [wd5,7-2] between us, and she heartity [fm1,-] congratulate [vp1,5-7] me have more successive [wd2,10-3] in my study, I say to her: " the same to you, too.
When I get [vp6,s] to the classroom, many classmates have [vp6,s] already taken their place [np3,12-0] .
Among the classmates haven't meet a long time , so we talk [vp6,s] more as soon as we meet.
But when the bell ring [vp6,s] .
During the course of having lessons, we all listen [vp6,s] carefully.
though [fm3,-] today is the first day to go to school this year.
I feel [vp6,s] very joyful and relaxing.
It is [vp6,1-8] two week [np3,1-6] since the new school term began.
Because we will have graduation exam of five subjects [np3,8-3] in this term.
I believe that every classmates [np3,4-0] all ... a new plan of study.
So our task of study are [vp3,5-1] very ... during these days, many classmates give up doing others things.
At [pp2,0-1] class, we listen carefully.
after class, we go [vp1,1-2] over carefully.
 [fm3,-] The new school term is a new beginning.
During [pp1,0-3] they teached [fm2,-] , we listened carefully and attentively.
To my surprise, the new teacher not only teached [fm2,-] but also was active in answing [fm1,-] our difficult question.
I hoped that they could succee [fm1,-] in teaching by his hard [wd2,2-] .
As I will have a maths text next Monday, I needed [vp1,10-10] [vp6,10-8] to over the text besides finishing my homework.
Though so [pp1,1-] , I felt have a ... day.
So I must return these books on [wd5,0-2] this Saturday, or I didn't [vp6,13-5] return the books on time.
I saw [wd3,-2] her carefully, and recognized her that she was my good friends in Junior middle school.
We spoke [vp1,1-9] our study situation and the lives [np1,9-3] situation each other.
but [fm3,-] it rained hard suddenly at hat time, our running had a half , so that we returned to school.Though the running didn't realize [vp1,4-2] this time, I felt it had important instructive [wd2,5-2] to us.
But during this sport, I had a mistaken [wd2,3-0] .
Before I came to the team, as the water on the ground in front of me held me back.I didn't cross this road, while [wd3,s-] I walked across another road.
So I was scolded by the head of the teacher [cc1,9-0] .
Many months ago, some parts of our school put [vp7,8-1] up.
Recently, these places has [vp3,3-2] almost finished [vp1,5-0] .
Because our school's playground had taken [vp2,5-3] a new look.
It's certain that the classmates liked [vp1,5-0] .
I though [fm1,-] after the new playground completely finished.
Next week, the senior three's classmates will have exam [np6,8-0] .
Though [cj1,0-1] so, we should stay at home to go over the lessons more carefully.
so [fm3,-] I decide that I will not watch TV, because now our study is very important.
We should spend more times [np5,4-3] in studying lessons.
We act [vp2,1-7] in actually to welcome the graduation exams.
We had lessons in chemistry lab this week, when we came [cc3,2-1] there, the first day, we hadn't a little habit .
lessons outside, they made a lot of noice [fm1,-] [np5,7-0] and affected [vp1,11-4] us to head lessons.
We should listen [vp1,2-3] lessons more carefully, but some classmates stood at last, sometimes they looked at the blackbroad [fm1,-] didn't clean.
We ended our classes in [wd4,5-1] chemistry lab.
So From May 1st to May 3nd [fm2,-] were our holidays.
But the graduation exams has [vp3,4-4] been nearer and nearer.
We didn't [vp1,1-7] much time to have a good time.
In these several days, I went to the library one day, the others [wd3,1-1] days I stayed at home to go over lessons.
After some times [np5,2-5] you should have a rest, or you went over too much in a short time.
You would be difficult [aj1,3-3] to remember it.
I felt [vp1,1-4] very instructive these days.
because [fm3,-] they dealt [vp2,2-4] the time was different, some people made [vp2,2-3] full use time to study [vp1,1-2] on work, and someone spent the time in chatting, gambling or playing.
When you did so, you will fell [vp1,6-5] your life is very valuable.
It has two studying building, and a [np7,1-2] experiment building.
They are strict [aj2,-3] to the students, and are all kind and helpful.
So he had to walk a long roads [np3,1-] to borrow books from a rich man.
I think Jun [fm1,-] is one of the best seasons in a year.It is time to have a composition class.
After the bell rang, the students took their place [np3,4-0] , waiting for the teacher.
At the time, some students began to talk [vp1,4-2] each other, some ones [wd5,10-5] read other books, others made noises.
Twenty seconds passed, the teacher entered the classroom, but she didn't make a [np7,4-1] apology.
She picked up a piece of chalk, writing on the blackbroad [fm1,-] "Teacher is late".
It was the First [fm3,-] week of this term.
And it is [vp6,10-4] a very important week.
It was our turn to be on duty at [pp1,-3] the First [fm3,-] week.
Cleanning [fm1,-] the school is a [np7,-3] very hard work.
But some classmate have [vp6,8-2] some trouble on [vp2,5-3] doing his work, and havn't [fm1,-] finished [vp6,11-2] his work.
The Relation Between A Boy And A Girl By the end of last week, at the political [wd2,1-1] class, our teacher gave us a talk.
She said that we mustn't be in love with any others [pr6,7-] 
He was [vp6,6-4] very strict with us, and his knowledge is so rich that he often tell us many storied [fm1,-] about natural science, and he often toll [fm1,-] us many stories about natural science, and some [np9,0-3] his interesting records.
It wides [wd2,-] our horizon.
Cars of today are increase [vp2,4-0] very quickly.
Roads always full [wd2,2-2] of cars such as [pr1,8-2] Thailand's Bangkok.
Old Guangzhou is [vp2,2-2] like that too.
Now the main Roads of new Guangzhou is enough [ad2,1-1] wide for the cars to run fast.
It [pr2,0-4] must thank the government for its working.
STATVE [fm1,-] OF LIBERTY
It was [vp2,6-2] the present that the people of France sent to America in the nineteenth century.
It was [vp2,24-3] made of copper and it was [vp2,32-3] 150 feet tall.
Since it was set up, it became [vp2,6-2] a symbol of liberty for the people of America.
Today Is Too Bad Today morning [np1,1-0] , when it was blur, I went to visit a friend.
I found it [pr2,2-3] had turned black.
Oh, no, I have [vp2,15-2] no umbrella.
I thought it will [vp2,2-4] stop in two hours.
But it lasted to [vp1,2-2] rained hard, and when I left, I had to borrow a [np7,0-1] umbrella and shippers, because the street was flooded.
Almost all aportment [fm1,-] house [np1,3-0]  [fm1, -] I GuangZhou have the met [np6,13-0] that is [np6,6-2] used to prevent the thief [np6,24-0] stealing.
The net painted into black or red s made [vp7,8-2] of iron.
This makes the house looks [vp4,3-1] like a cage and the people in it as if [wd3,1-] birds in the cage.
This mirror's [np4,1-3] the public order today is so bad and makes the city lifeless.
The visitors who come from foreign country [np6,5-0] is [np6, 8-3] surprised at it.
This is a good matter [cc1,4-0] to [pp1,7-2] the develop [fm2,-] of the world's science ad [fm1,-] to [pp1,19-2] the player of computer.
 [fm2,-] Now the factory of CPU had three: Intel, Cyrix and AMD.
In some field, [fm2,-] Cyrix ar [fm1,-] AMD's technology of CPU's [np4,2-1] produce [vp5,3-0] even over vp1,14-3] that of Intel.
Because the competition of [wd3,-] them is very keen, the price of the CPU falls down very quickly.
There were [cc3,1-1] holidays in this National Day.
Those should [vp6,1-1] be the universal rejoicing days.
But, when I came to know that there were three subjects would have a test as soon as the holidays went out. [cc2,1-1] .
Cromprehending [fm1,-] [wd2,-]

Reading this, I comprehended something and I felt quiet ashamed that I had had no physical training for more than one year outside the physical cuiture [fm1,-] class.
This was a bad habid, [fm1,-] and I wanted to correct it [cc3,12-2] from today.
So, I held my barbell [fm1,-] at once that had been [vp6,10-3] covered with dust and raised it....
The Practice [cc1,-2] Chinese Teacher
Three weeks ago, two practice Chinese teachers came to my class and began to teacher [wd2,-] .
At first, I wondered if they could teach us good as if the official Chinese teacher, for, being so young and shout [fm1,-] of experience.
They were consicientious [fm1,-] in their practice [wd2,1-1] work.
The most remarkable one of the woman [fm2,-] singers.
She just got [vp6,2-19] the prize that [wd5,2-1] for the best woman singer who is recommended n [fm1,-] the area of Southeast Asia.
Her songs are well-known [aj2,-1] by their free form.
That is why I live [fm1,-] her songs.
However, every time, when I heard [vp6,4-8] her songs, I always felt [vp6,1-1] exciting.
Not long ago, she published [cc3,0-3] a new disc call [vp4,-] The Seclect [fm1,-] Happy Music of Wang Fei .
it [fm3,-] have [vp3,1-] 16 songs, such as Dubiousness, DI-Dar.They are so good that even [wd4,0-5] you have heard 100 times you didn't [vp9,9-2] feel sick.
Although there are five motorcycle races in Asia except t [pr2,7-0] , it is the best and newest one.
So Zhuhai have enough conditions to be the central [fm2,-] of the motorcycle's athletics in Asia.
After all the engineering [cc2,2-2] is finished, it will be able to hold 12000 spectators.
I am so exciting [aj4,3-0] and I am proud [aj2,-1] for it.
After walking [wd3,1-0] round the Lake, we saw the performance of "going [wd3,0-4] on the steel wire".
his make [vp6,12-3] us felt [vp5,4-1] cheated.
 [wd4,0-13] Last three hours, we walked and walked from place to place to take photos.
Although every landscape have [vp6,11-2] good names, but it always bring vp6,19-2] us disappointment.
A part [cc1,0-2] of people only layed [fm2,-] cards all through the three hours.
I think the most intent [wd7,2-1] thing I did is I left my foot mark on the hill.
But the unfeeling [wd7,1-1] fact would not make me downhearted.
I looked for the reason that I failed and I found the most important reason was that I had few pressing [wd7,0-1] feeling.
 [fm1,-] It makes me think out al [fm1,-] kinds of ways to improve the study ways [wd3,1-0] and to arranged [vp5,1-0] the study time more reasonable [wd2, 7-0] .
My motto of today is "All the work today [np1,2-0] is finished [vp6,7-2] within today".

He wanted to have gone [vp6,3-2] to London to give the papers to the government.
But his daughter didn't allow [wd3,3-3] him to go, because he was not strong enough to go.

At last, Miss Green, Dr. Hunter's secretary, received the police's phone call about the true [wd2,4-0] , and she told Dr Hunter sadly.
Then two policemen came to know about the impostor's [fm2,-] character [wd3,3-0] and Miss Green go [vp6,s] with the policemen to help them.

But , this year, almost everyone in the class was mobilized [wd3,-] to attend the meeting.
The programmes that we were practing such as comic dialogue, [fm2,-] fashion show, sing [vp4,0-2] in chorus and so on.
All the actores [fm1,-] were excited and they put their heart into the practise.
If you wanted [vp6,2-0] to see them impatiently [wd3,8-0] , you could [vp6,12-14] go to the top of the No.4 Middle School from Monday to Friday, you would [vp6, 30-3] see them there.
The Fashion Show Of Our Class On TV, I had seen [vp6,2-7] the fashion hoe [fm1,-] many times.
So , when I heard that our class will [vp6,4-4] have a fashion show in the Art Festival, I felt very interested.

Although it [pr2,1-4] was the lunch time, hearing his comic dialogue I felt not hungry but belly ache.
In a word, the Art Festivol [fm1,-] was successful.
If China Lost Lekai [fm2,-] In China, the films from the foreign country [np6,2-0] are sold much cheaper than on [wd3,0-3] their native countries.
The film factory in China calls [vp7,3-1] Lekai.
A [np8,0-2] Lekai [fm2,-] film is sold [vp1,3-4] only about ten yuan, This makes the foreign films have to be sold in [wd3,0-3] a low price.
In other countries which have no film factory [fm2,-] of their own.Such as in Russia, a [np7,0-1] imported film is sold in [wd3,3-3] about fifteen dollar.
Would the ported films be sold still [ad1,2-4] in a low price, if China lost Lekai [fm2,-] ?
Though we had known [vp6,1-8] that this Winter Holiday could be very short and we would have to make up lessons in it, I had hoped the teachers would give us few homeworks [np5,1-] , then, I could have a good rest to meet the new term.
Every teacher but Mr Zeng gave us a lot of homeworks [np6,3-0] .
Oh, my god, [fm3,-] there were only thirteen free days.
In these days, I could have to pay some New Years [np4,2-1] calls [wd3,4-3] to my relatives with my parents , have to finish the exercised [wd2,2-0] .
What a Holiday [fm3,-] !
They wanted to devoloped [wd7,0-3] the Bull's vigour: dare not to do the tired things.
Proping up [wd3,1-1] umbrellas, we alked about the busy Flower Fair and the beautiful flowers excited.
The bad weather didn't make us dissappointed [fm1,-] , instead we had a good time at that night.
To the children, the Spring Festival means they can wear the [np7,10-2] new clothers [fm1,-] , get the "Lishe".
It's time for them to havest [fm1,-] .
To the adult, the Spring Festival is the busy day [np6,6-0] .
To most people , they will play deep [wd3,1-3] into the night, get up later [aj3,2-3] in next morning.
Maybe it knew that we would go to visit our old Classmaster [fm1,-] , it stopped raining at AM 9:00 [wd1,1-] At 10:00.All the friend [fm2,-] had been [np1,6-3] the assembly point, but one, At last, we knew from the phone call that he had forgotten it.
After we leave [vp6,16-3] the teacher's home at 12:30.
We quarrelled about the place where we would [vp9,6-2] have lunch.
At the fast food restaurant we would have lunch [wd1,7-0] .At the fast food restaurant, we threw the ice which in the soft drink to other [pr3,10-1] friends.
The new term had [vp6,3-6] been on Formally for two weeks.
All customs that in last term Had [vp6,20-2] been restored.
We had [vp6,26-6] to go to school at night again.
Besides this,, we had [vp6,39-4] to go to school at night again.
Besides this, we had [vp6,52-15] to go to school to read aloud the text [wd1,3-0] at AM 7 :30 [wd1, 2-0] , and we had [vp6,74-12] to write the old [cc4,0-1] words from vp2,6-1] memory everyday.
Although we didn't [vp6,91-5] want to do those things, they were [vp6,100-11] the only way to get [vp2,0-2] the [np7,0-1] success in our learning.
Such as the new basket-ball ground will be finished building [wd5,2-0] soon.
We all were [vp6,8-8] busy doing the maths excises day and night.

It caped [wd3,1-3] the letter "I".
When I told his [pr4,2-2] this result, he opened his mouth, last [vp4,4-2] fifteen seconds.
I had believes [vp6,1-0] that it was a very hard question which few people could work out.
Otherwise, I would work [vp6,19-3] it [vp1,3-0] like Cuozongci.
This Saturday, there came a bad news that we would had to [vp4,2-2] write composition.
But, besides his, I had to do the chemical exercises which had eleven pages, had to do the English exercises which has [vp6,7-2] twelve pages, had to go over the English lessons, had to go over the political lessons for he coming examination on next Tuesday.

We could [vp6,35-0] free ourself [fm2,-] from the provisional basket-ball courts [np6,3-0] .
The old courts [np6,8-0] were [vp6,52-1] covered with sands.
After it raided the old courts were [vp6,62-5] always being [vp6,4-1] covered with water.

Their calm [wd2,1-2] shook me very much.
As soon as the water turned back, they took an active part in rebuilding their house [np6,8-0] .
From them, I saw the strongwilled [wd2,3-0] ; I saw the active life.

in [fm3,-] schools boys and girls are leaning [fm1,-] languages.

some [fm3,-] girls who study English found that it is difficult to study English.
For example, hare [wd7,3-5] some difficulty in produacing [fm1,-] some world [wd3,6-] , make [vp4,5-5] this grammer [fm1,-] into other grammer [fm1,-] and so on.
because [fm3,-] of these reason [np6,4-] , they found English is very hard to learn.
The teacher told us that who find English is hard to learn as they don't find the best way to learn [np7, 4-2] foreign language .
Which is the best way to learn a foreignage [fm1,-] ?
if [fm3,-] we learn a second language in the same way , it won't seem so difficult.
He listen [vp3,2-4] to what people say and he tries to guess what people say.
So we learn English should be speak it as much as possible and using and thinking in it as many [wd3,7-3] as you can.
I hope all the boys and girl [np6,s-] will learn English well.

but [fm3,-] -- the tcorst [fm1,-] thing came .his [fm3,-] uncle who prepared to kill Mu fasa,made a [np7,2-1] accident [cc3,3-] .
he [fm3,-] made two friends.

They helped him to be [np7, s-] king.
This film win [vp3,s-] severel [fm1,-] Oscar Prize [np3,3-] .
I have a lot of friends, from when I'm a childe [fm1,-] I thought everyone must have friends.
so [fm3,-] I got everywhere I can make friends.
when [fm3,-] I stayed in the childrens [np6,2-1] ' house [wd3,3-] .
I found a girl who is [vp6,s-] beautiful and lovely.
I wanted to make friend [vp2,s-] with her.
later [fm3,-] I knew her name is Zhao bo .
she [fm3,-] is a good girl.
when [fm3,-] I left the childrens' house [wd3,5-] and went into school.
I left with [vp1,s-] Zhaobo, however, I remember her for ever .
then [fm3,-] I founded [wd3,3-2] Pan Ling, which [pr5,6-6] has a pair of big eyes and a lovely mouth .
she [fm3,-] very clever and got very well with her studies.
We studied each other,played [wd4,-] each other.
but [fm3,-] when we were in the Grade 4.
so [fm3,-] we must be devide [fm1,-] [wd3,10-] .
we [fm3,-] were crying [vp6,7-] .
after [fm3,-] five years ,we still write letters [wd4,2-2] each other.
When I'm in the senior school, I made friends with everyone, but Liu weling is my the [wd5,4-2] best friend, we talk, laugh, study, play together, I lope we don't devide [wd3,11-] , if it is possible, I will thank God .
I will say:" thank [fm3,-] you, my God!
" friends [fm3,-] are part of my life.
could [fm3,-] you make [vp2,1-3] friend with me?
when [fm3,-] I was young , I had ever made a joke.
The first lesson was English, the teacher taught us some sentences which used usually [wd3,9-] .
I recorded then [fm1,-] though I didn't know what they meant.
the [fm3,-] teacher who taught me English asked me: "what's your name?
" the [fm3,-] teacher smiled to me I think :"the [fm3,-] teacher was [vp6,5-6] smiling , my answer must be right.
" So [wd5,-s] I was very happy, because I said a right answer by myself .
but [fm3,-] when I know the truth, my face turned red at me [wd5,2-] .
I said to myself: "you [fm3,-] are very foolish, you mustn't make the same joke!
" so [fm3,-] I was interested in English from then on.
I must thank to [wd5,-] this joke, because it eruacrage [fm1,-] [vp6,s-] me to like English and learn it hard [wd3,10-] .
I think the joke was [vp6,s-] very good.
as there are over 1200000000 people in the [wd5,s-] China .
but [fm3,-] why the most popular language in the world is English, not Chinese?
there [fm3,-] must be a political reason in history.
tens [fm3,-] of thousands of people said that China was the strongest country.
Also, China was considied [fm1,-] to be the largest market in the world.
They looked down upon Chinese , taking up many land whick [np3,5-3] [fm1,-] belonged to china.
they [fm3,-] also made a plan for taking up all the world.

It has become a very important part in the [wd5,s-] people's life.
many [fm3,-] school [np6,s-] in China have television [np6,s-] .
Some of [wd5,2-7] feel that television is good for children because it helps them learn about their country and the world.
It also helps children to do every thing [wd3,s-] better in the [wd5,s-] school.
they [fm3,-] feel that there are too many programes [fm1,-] about love and crime on TV.
And that even programmes of education don't help children's enducation [fm1,-] .
If they watch TV, they don't need talk [vp5,s-] .
When school children watch TV, they read a lot less [wd7,s-] .
Because of this they don't learn to read or write as [wd5,s-] quickly at school.
when [fm3,-] they watch TV, they play less.
Tat [fm1,-] first it was difficult but soon a sot [fm1,-] of good changes.

Almost [wd4,-1] people who live in Beijing go to work by bus or by bike.
More and more people play in [wd3,0-1] outskirts in [wd3,0-1] weekend.
Having gone over my lessons, I began to look at the sky through the window, instead of going to bed immediartely [fm1,-] .
This afternoon was very hot, the temperature s about nearly [wd3,1-1] 30.
I used to swim in my childhood, but now I haven't swam [fm2,1-] for about ten years, I think June is one of the best months in a year.

when she laid [cc3,1-2] a child, she must take care of the baby.
When the baby grew, she had to [vp5,1-5] sent her child to school.

Many students who were gratuated [fm1,-] [wd4,4-4] have been famous people.
The playground, which we often play on it [wd5,7-0] , and have many exercises.
The teacher teach [vp3,2-1] well.
they [fm3,-] are strict with us.
My hometown My hometown lies in the south of Yang dong Couty [fm1,-] .
Some new houses and new schools have been build [vp7,3-0] .
The crop have [vp3,2-2] been good.
so [fm3,-] the agricultural production is going high.
My home town is very beautiful and the people in it were [vp6,11-2] very kind.
The temprature [fm1,-] is about 30c.
When I see this scean [fm1,-] , I think about I often swim [vp6,5-3] in my childhood.
It will be lasted [vp7,3-2] two hours.
So they join every select beauty match [cc1,2-] .
If she wins he match, she will cry out : "oh [fm3,-] !
Though men have strong muscles, handsome looking, ense [fm1,-] of humor and learned brain, they have to be audiences.
And this is why men must work hard at their works [np5, 2-0] .
help [fm3,-] each other
Because of these, they havn't [fm1,-] the happness [fm1,-] like the ordinary persons.
If a man have [vp3,3-1] hair, he won't want to be blunt [wd7, 12-0] .
Let's help each other, [wd4,4-5] make the world full of warm.Boss Many people want to be a boss.
First, he must " throw away" their wifes [fm2,-] who help and stay with him when they [pr3,16-3] are in trouble.
It coundn't [fm1,-] show that they are bosses.
At [pp2,-1] less, you must know "OK", "Yes", "No", "Very good" and so on to show your "knowledge".
Because of rain, umbrella, shoes, rainboots [fm2,-] and rain coat can be seen everywhere.
The shop which sell them has [vp3,5-2] many [np8,0-1] business.
terrible [fm3,-] women
They haven't powerful mucle [fm1,-] , smooth teeth and lots of money.
If the women call [wd3, 3-4] them to the west, men dare not go to the east; if the women all them to it, en dare not stand.
But it is interesting at the men like these are [wd5,9-3] always become rich after several years.
My New school My school is a key school which has a history of 0 [wd7,11-0] .
Its [np4,0-5] many graduates have become famous person [np6,4-0] .
school has two teaching-building [np6,1-0] , a build [wd2,1-2] of experiment and a big play [cc4,-] ground.
Now, students are doing excesics [fm1,-] on the play ground.
When I got to the shop, "oh [fm3,-] !
I remember that when I was a child [,7-0] .
I ofter [fm1,-] go [vp6,4-1] swimming.
I think that June is one of the best month [np6,4-3] in a year.
Time pass [vp3,1-1] fast.
It is because I haven't firmly grasped [cc3,3-2] the time.
And this wasted me many [np8,3-1] time.
Beginning of the new term After a very short " inter holidays" which had only laten [fm1,-] for two weeks, having finished the homework which was so much that we must do it all through the holidays, we began to have the added classes [, 36-0] .
This term seems to be a very busy term [wd6,8-0] .
It was [vp6,1-8] only two week [np6,1-0] since the new term began.
But we had paid [vp6,3-5] a large number [wd3,2-2] of money.
At first we must hand in the money for registring [fm1,-] .
In this term it raised [vp7,s-] to almost 00 an.
The notice said that it was because the price of paper had en risen [vp7,7-0] .
How can the teachers take decisive action without asking for approval and only report it later as a fait [fm1,-] accompli [fm1,-] !
How can they use our money that haven't [vp3,7-3] been handed over!
It was said that the reward of the added classes would be collected fore [fm2,-] long.
If it go [vp3,2-3] on like this, we will go bankrupt sooner or later.the [fm3,-] whiteboards Now the teachers in our school needn't be harm [vp7,1-] by the dust of the chalk any more.
It is because that the blackboards [fm1,-] in our school was changed to whiteboards last week.
The students sitting the front of the classroom benefit [fm1,-] from it too.
After the whiteboard was use [vp7,4-0] , the air became cleaner than before, but after used some times , the white board becomes dirty.And the white board is hard to be dry.
This prevent [vp3,1-5] us from writing on it.
On [wd5,0-2] last Thursday, when we were having a chemistry class, dust [wd7,0-6] was burned on the play ground.
The smell make [vp6,2-2] us uncomfortable.
The smell of the lavatory was bring [vp7,-] to us.
This Thursday we were told that there would be running surrounding [wd3, 1- 4] the Jin hua street on [wd5,0-3] the ext day, so we had to come to school at 7:10.
In [wd3,0-2] Friday morning, it rained very hard.
I thought that the running must be given up, so I wnet [fm1,-] to school at the time we have [vp6, 8-6] the morning reading on ordinary days.
After having run several hundred mertres , the rain became harder and harder, so that we can stop [vp6, 9-1] running.
Now we have little [np7,1-] thing of entertainment to do in our room.
It lies [wd3,-] in our head teacher.
In these days, we had been [vp6,5-4] forbidden to play football unless it was on [wd3,0-4] the phsiclal [fm1,-] training class, forbidden to play the Five Pieces Chess, even forbidden to play the Chinese Chess .
Though it seemed very silly, we thought it fairly interesting in the games we can [vp6,9-0] play.
Everyday, as soon as the class is over, serval [fm1,-] groups of classmates get together and play Flying [fm3,-] Chess [fm3,-] .
This make [vp3, 1-2] me think that the Flying [fm3,-] Chess [fm3,-] will be forbidden to play sooner or later.
The first part was the problems essential to be answer [vp7,4-0] .
Every group must pick out five of the problems and answer it [pr3,8-0] .
The second part was the problems to try to be the first to answer [,13- 0] .
every [fm3,-] subject made full use of all the time to give classes and reveiv [fm1,-] .
Every day there would be some exercise papers handed out, such as Chinese, physece [fm1,-] , chemistry, English...., all the time had to be used to do the paper.
Last week the [wd5,0-2] senior three were going to have the simulate examination.
So the [wd5,0-2] senior two had to lend them the classrooms and moved to the lab to have classes.
Having classes in the chemistry lab was very unconvenient [fm2,-] .
This would late to the morning reading [,6-0] .
It was very bad [wd3,-] for the teacher to get there to give us lessons.
They must [vp9,1-2] got down from the fifth floor long before the class began, and get back to the fifth floor after class.
The only conveniet [fm1,-] thing was to play balls.
The experiment exams This Tuesday and wedesday [fm1,-] there will be experiment exams of physics, biology and chemistry one after another.
This took us into the tide of experiment [np6, 4-0] .
The physics lab and the biology lab opened for us to some practice [wd2,8-0] these days.
This brough [fm1,-] us much diffculty [fm1,-] in doing experiment.
He [fm3,-] mot [fm1,-] trouble thing was to see the video recording of physics experiment.
It would be [vp6,2-5] showed [fm2,-] at [wd5,1-3] last Tuesday night.
his made the students didn't need to go to school at night stayed at school [,14- 0] .
But at that night, after waiting for more than half an hour in the basement, we were told that the videocorder [fm2,-] didn't work.
My school was [vp6,2-3] a key school with a history of seventy years.
The school has thirty six [fm2,-] class [np6,2-0] .
In the school, there are two building [np6,1-0] for teaching, one building for experiment and a large play ground.
Playing Basketball Since the basketball [cc1,1-1] court was built in our school, the tide of playing basketball came into being in our class.
But the tide last [vp3,3-4] to the night now.
Today was very hot, the air temperature was nearly thirty [wd4,-] centigrade.
most [fm3,-] of them swam well.
A little girl was studying [wd3, 0- 1] swimming, teached [fm2,-] by her mother.
Since then, I had never had [vp6,5-2] a swim.
I regarded June as one of the best month [np6,5-0] in a year.
Time is leaving [cc2,2-1] quickly.
Because my English is not so well [ad2,5-0] , speaking is worse than writing.
I will fell [fm1,-] sorry for this.
I thought: in act, I am afraid of you for I doesn't [vp3,7-2] believe myself.
If I try my best, nobody laugh [vp3, 1-2] at me and they are friendly to me.
Don't let my teacher and parents desappoint [fm1,-] .
Have any else [,2-0] ?
Yes, it is sports.I often didn't [vp6,2-12] get up until 10 o'clock when I needn't go to school ago.
Through father's words, I knowed [fm2,-] it wasted time for I got up late.
I must get up early and have [wd3,0-2] some sports.
It's helpful for [wd3,2-1] me.
I thought it is [vp6,3-9] pleasant o breathe the fresh air in the morning.
There were green tree [np6,3-0] , green grassland, the orange sun, little birds and the happy people in it.
Ever since then, I insist [vp6,-] to get up early and have [cc3,-] sports.
A very unhappy thing was happened [vp7,5-3] in this week--- my little tortoise is dead.
Then I liked "my friend" than before because he was the last one and I very [ad2,1-9] regard that I hadn't taken good care of them.
But I couldn't change the thing, the little tortoise [wd4,-] still as died .
But I hope dear tortoise can find his friends and become happiely [wd2,10-0] .
That was Guang zhou if it can be elected a health city of country [,13-0] .
people [fm3,-] worked as one and tried hard to make Guang Zhou cleaning.
But when I saw my Dad and Mum worked [vp5,7-1] carefully, I couldn't free [cc3,2-2] my hands.
When I was cleaning, Mum said to me: " Should we take a watch [wd7,-] for cleaning the windows quickly?
It's [pr2,0-4] sure I will win.
I did the word [fm1,-] carefully than before.
I hope The flower city can be got [vp7,7-3] cleaning than before.
Today we had the sports meeting at the Worker [np4,2-1] Stadium.
Today is happy and exciting [cc4,4-0] .
In this, my class has already lead [wd7,6-0] .

After this, there were some classmates win a prize [,6-0] .
How exciting was it [wd1,3-0] !We can see and feel our classmates love our class and school through this sports meeting.
It was very intructive [fm1,-] for us.
In that time, how I can...if I can catch up with other classmates in a short time, I must study hard [ad3,s-] than before and give up bad habits.
What is [vp3,1-3] my bad habits?
I try to give up it [wd1,5-0] .
they [fm3,-] are planted by my dad.
After water the flowers, some drop of water slide follow the flowers [,11-0] .
And looks like to say " Good morning" to you [,8-0] .
When you breathe the fresh air look at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy is it [wd1,3-0] !The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me much [cc4,-] knowledge about plants.
The feeling was very interesting and intructive [cc4,6-0] .
Worried, because the military training was very tired, I afraid of this as tired as the military training [,17-0] .
When we reached the base, and began to work, I found to become a farmer was tired [aj4,7-0] .
But there was happy in it [,5-0] .
Through this farmer's work, I learned [cc3,0-4] a lot of knowledge.
On Friday afternoon, our class had a meeting for choose [vp5, 6-4] the monitor and cadres.
It can be shown [vp7,3-2] our ideas.
We can choose the monitor and cadres who we all like the [wd5,8-1] best.
It can be given [vp7,3-6] all the classmates a fair chance.
All the people believed her [pr4,4-4] can accept this work.
She was very happy.I was verry [fm1,-] happy for her, too.
I believed it was very bored [aj4,5-4] before I saw it.
The film was exciting and moving and angering [fm1,-] .
When I saw the Chinese severely scolded [vp5,6-2] the Japanese, I was exciting [aj4,2-0] ;when I saw : the Chinese common people left their home and become [vp6,8-2] a fugitive; the children left their parents, no food, no clothes, cried on the street; the old person saw their lands became ruins and cried bitterly, I was very moving [aj4,3-0] .
When I saw : the Japanese named himself " the king of the Heaven", they made trouble out of nothing, tried to agression [wd2,-] China and impudented [wd2,-] to make China pay for the war reparations, I angered [wd2,-] very much.
In the end, we united and be [vp4,-1] winner.
I must place the interest [np6,4-6] of the country above everything else.
Then the base [wd3,2-3] is very bad.
In the junior middle school, I was absent-minded to have the lessons of geography [,15-0] .
At that time, geography wasn't diffucult, I depended on my memory to have [vp1,-1] tests.
And often passed them [, 3-0] .
But in the senior middle school now, understanding is very important to learn geography, so I want to get good grades is impossible [,22-0] .
I known [fm2,-] my base [wd3,5-2] was bad, this was fact.
Now I believe it isn't very difficult be [vp5,7-3] learn geography better.
The Emperor's new clothes Long long [wd6,-] age there loved [wd3,4-2] an emperor, he cared more for the beautiful clothes thatn [fm1,-] for anything else.
The cheat knew the emperor liked fine few clothes, then they came to tell the emperor that they were the best weaver [np6,4-0] and they can weave [vp6,2-17] a kind of cloth which the people of stupid or unfit for their office could not see.
The official could not see anything, but his anwer [fm1,-] was as same as the Prime Minister .
The emperor walked in the street and have [vp6,7-3] the "new clothes".
Many people pretend [vp6,2-4] to see the clothes, but suddenly a little child said: " He has nothing on!
The Emperor heard the cries and he knew that the people's words were true, but he went on the procession to keep [wd3,1-2] his face.
Example: we won [wd4,1-1] first place on the programme of flowers.
These was a [np7,0-2] exciting news for us.
It also greatly encourage [vp3,3-1] us.
They didn't mine [fm1,-] if they couldn't win the prize.
Then everyone rehearsed again and again, no one mined [fm1,-] tired and hard.
as a NO.4 Middle School's student, we were proud of our art programme had so high level [,17-0] .
But all the thinks [wd2,-] could not leave [cc2,6-9] teachers and students' hard exercise and the others' support.
Example: In my class, Ao Jingya, Tao Xin, Chen Xiaocong, Ye Jiaqing, Li Yongming and Lui Siming made sixty-one card [np6,1-0] on which there were-and [wd7, 10-0] ---.
Today on the art programme, when Liang Shaoying was singing, all the class Two's students put up our these --- and ---, and shaked [fm2,-] them [wd7,24-0] .
At this time, we moved [vp7,4-1] deeply, I thought Liang Shao ying was, too.
And she is impatient, then she hates [cc3,-1] slow very much, and she does what she ays at once.
I am different [aj2,-1] for her, no ways, I am often taught by her.
She grow [vp3,1-3] old and querulous.
Example: Sometimes I got up late, she must [vp9,1-3] :" Dan, be [cc5,1-1] quickly!
be [cc5,0-1] quickly!
now [fm3,-] is 7:30!
" " ah [fm3,-] ,7:30?
When I dress, her voice is said again: " Dan, be [cc5,0-1] quickly!
You will [vp9,1-3] late for school if you don't hurry.
" " ok [fm3,-] !
though [fm3,-] she sometimes so trouble , but [wd5,9-8] I know she loves me, loves our family.
The Twentieth Week The End of The Emperor's New Clothes In my hildhood, I have read [vp6,5-2] this story.
But my idea for [wd3,-] it is different [wd4,-2] that time.
When I was only a little girl, I ought the honest boy was very kind, and he was as young as me, so I very [ad2,1-2] liked himm [fm1,-] I believed the emperor went back his palace,he knew himself was worng and regreted m2,-] .
So my idea for this story has been changed [vp7,7-0] .
Now I believe the emperor wanted to keep [cc3,1-2] his face and held his head higher, then he couldn't see the road.
Because he had nothing on really, so [wd5,6-5] the stone cut his skin.
Sham was punish him [vp7,2-] .
Though he tried his est to keep [cc3,1-2] his face, but [wd5,9-4] at last he couldn't.
perhaps [fm1,-] after many years, my idea will change.
Because the story ells us: Fact must hit down sham [fm1,-] .
When I got there, I saw my little sister whom I haven't seen [vp6,8-3] so long time [pp2,2-] .
How [wd3,0-5] a little and lively girl!
When I saw her to play [vp5, 5-2] a toy, I thought [vp2,1-5] my childhood, and my toys.
Though I didn't have so many at that time, I still played so happy [wd2,4-0] .
At that time, I usually stayed at home with Dad and Mum in the evening that I couldn't play with [wd4,-] friends.
So I like the night of power cut [wd3,7-0] .
" and "TT1/4"... How [wd3,0-3] a happy night!
I needn't [vp9,1-1] worried, needn't do home work ... Now, my childhood was [vp7,2-1] passed.
I doesn't like [vp3,2-0] the night of power cut [wd7,9-0] , because I must go over the homework.My little friends are the same as me, they must study.
.. but I doesn't [vp3,1-2] feel unhappy.
But [wd3,0-11] a person in the world, he can't always take from others, he ought to give to others and his country.
If I do it, I must study hard now, though I can't play as before, I still happy [,2-0] , because I study for my duty.
Xuan Yun sheng and me is [vp3,5-5] a pair of good friends.
Though some years were [vp7,3-1] passed, our friendship didn't change.
The feeling what [pr5,2-8] she gives me is very kind [cc4,8-] and clever.
She tells me her nose likes her Dad [wd7,7-0] .
Her hair is often plaited on the [wd4,-] , I believe this fits her.
" Xuan Yun sheng likes smiling, sports, reading, listening to the songs, watching TV, sleeping (she often say [vp3,2-2] to me: " Brother, I really want to go to bed!
I will care [vp1,2-1] her and study her.
The Third Week What matter is paid attention to the most recently is President is elected in Taiwan [,14-0] .
Through [fm1,-] I'm a student, I still know Li Denghui is a schemer.
Out country even doesn't afraid of America and Japan, of course, we don't afraid of him [,15-0] .
This likes a man begs others to hit his brother [,9-0] .
I have still remebered: Four years ago, when Li Denghui was elected President the first, he told all the people that he would try to help to unite China and Tai Wan [fm2,-] .
But now, his deeds is different,what he have [vp3,2-3] ever said "completely, What a big lie!
" through [fm1-] Li Deng hui is elected President, the fact hasn't changed, China must be unite!
The Footh [fm1,-] Week
In fact, I had [vp6,3-7] liked it when I was a pupil.At that time, I often played with my classmates, and even with mum.
I have taken [vp6,2-10] part in the match of kicking shuttlecock in my school.
When I went into the middle school, the studing [fm1,-] was ore difficult than before, and the homework was more and more.
Then after a long ime, I didn't grasp how to kick the shuttlecock [cc6,-1] nearly.
But when I studied in the senior school, I found the boys of my class are [vp6,7-4] good at icking shuttlecock.
When I see they kick so happy [wd2,6-0] , I can't help rying.
The girls in my class look like shy very much, but when they are playing, they won't shy [wd1,2-0] .
Kick [vp4,0-10] shuttlecock after the class was ver is a good thing.
When I make it, I think the struggle of Guang Zhou [fm2,-] on 12.
A lot of soldiers lost their lives for our country and people on that day.how [fm3,-] great they are!
As the person of Guang Zhou [fm2,-] , I must remember this history.Our happy living is changed by the great soldiers' flesh and blood.
We must care our happy living [wd3,-] .

So his son and he were caught [wd3,2-3] to the governor Gessler.
He ordered Tell shoot [vp5,3-2] at the apple which was on his son's head.
Without saying a word, William Tell drew two arrows and splited [fm2,-] the apple in half with one arrow.
If the arrow shoot [vp8, 3-5] at him,he wouldn't bow.
Facing the emperor, William Tell and his son were calm and brave.Their courage [cc2,1-5] quickly got round througout Switzerland.
The Swiss were [vp7,2-1] encourage, they rose up and forced the Austrain soldiers to go from Switzerland.
It said [vp7,1-7] that she went to foreign country later, so I haven't seen her for a long time.
She was from the north of China, but she could speak the language of Guang Zhou [cc6,-2] very much.
She taught Chinese, and the classes which she gave [cc3,4-3] were not interesting.
Then she let me stay in classroom after school over [wd5, 2-0] .
I was first punish [vp7,3-0] , I will remember forever.
But the sun has rised [fm2,-] up.

The street was [wd5,1-2] became busy.
A new start----Let us care [wd3,-] it together!
My grandpa is eight [wd3,2-3] three years old.
He is thin [cc6,-2] very much.
If someone don't [vp3,2-4] know my grandpa's ge, they [pr3,8-9] can't guess that he is such an old man.
My grandpa often smile [vp3,3-0] , especially when we go to see him.
He often tells me some great men, the custom of some places and the [wd5,1-3] other interesting things.
My grandpa care [vp2,2-4] my studying very much.
He said to me: " The important thing is that you really grasp [cc3,2-2] the knowledge.
But when I was in my childhood, I wasn't clear what was [wd1,4-2] my ideal.
In my heart, the good thing was too much [np8,4-0] , I didn't know what was the best.

" I answered with my heart, full of moving [wd3,-] .
Though my grandpa and grandma didn't have [cc3,2-4] a lot of knowledge, though they can't give me some advice on the studying,they have helped p6,21-0] me --- give me support.
I hope you get [wd3,3-3] a good health forever!
I don't want to only [ad1,4-11] do the homework at home or go to bed all day, so I ceide [fm1,-] to do the sport in the morning.
This morning I went to stadium shich [fm1,-] is near my house with my friends in [wd3,0-2] 6:45.
Though it was early, many people have come [vp6,7-4] here to do exercise.
Running [vp6,0-8] 800 metres, we played a game of badminton.
But after some time, we played so good [ad2,3-0] and we were exciting [aj4,2-2] very much.
Perhaps we didn't for what , only for our happy feeling.A altogether, everything were [vp3,1-1] beautiful and everything make [vp3, 1-0] us happy.
What a happy [cc4,2-3] sport it was!
We love the sport, the morning and our living [wd3,8-0] .
though [fm3,-] the things are small, they can give strength to a person who is in trouble.
I still remember it happened in [pp1,-] last two years: One day I had a high fever suddenly [ad1,5-3] in the school.
I hadn't a little strength to do everything [pr6,7-0] , and I almost lay [wd3,2-1] down.
We have not had supper, and I felt terrible [vp6,8-0] .
" Looking at her, I knew that she was tried [vp7,2-2] very much, the same as me.
In this week, all the students of our class were busy for [wd3,8-4] preparing the sports meeting.
Who were busy the most were the seventeen boys and girls [,10-0] .
They epresented [fm1,-] our class to 3?3?.
These girls and boys took care [cc3,-] 3of this chance very much.
after the school over [wd5,3-0] , in the evening studing of our own, they practiced [wd2,1-3] on the playground.
And they buyed [fm2,-] the shirts themselves in order that they can wear [vp6,13-3] the same clothes to 3?3?.
All the students of our class must thank [vp1, 7-2] of them.
I read [vp6,1-7] a story about loving our homeland recently: During the course of the war of rising up [wd7,10-0] the Japanese.
Ji Hong chang (1/4ao* ) has been asked [vp6,5-3] to visit America by the1* * 3.
Then some chinese [fm3,-] felt themselves inferior (?
When the postmaster knew that they were chinese [fm3,-] ,he sneered: "China?
Ha ha..." Ji Hong chang's friend felt him inferior and said to him: " Why did you said [vp6,3-4] you were a Chinese?
He catched [fm2,-] his friend's shirt and shouted: " Don't you think it is a disgrace as a Chinese?
But I think it is a proud [wd2,5-7] that I am a Chinese.
Our two new teachers are so young, and they are nice [cc6,-2] very much.
But I know: though we maybe [ad1,1-5] will not meet each other, I will remember them and the time that we stayed [wd3,8-2] together forever.
We saw two men fright [wd3,4-0] .
The reason why they fought was a man knocked [vp2,2-3] the other's shoulder.
only [fm3,-] for this, they quarreled at first, then they didn't give in, at last they fought.
I like sports, all kinds of sports are insteresting [fm1,-] to me.
his is one of the reasons which [pr5,6-3] I like swimming.
The other is that my mum told me swimming can [vp6,6-5] make us stronger and taller.
 [vp9,3-] I not only like to play table tennis but also watch table tennis match.
It gives me [cc3,-1] relaxation.
I like the [wd5,2-2] other sports, for example: basketball, football, volleyball and o on, they all can keep us healthy.
I agree [vp2,1-2] her words.
And eating is a good was [wd7,5-3] for me, too.
This was [vp6,s-] is often useful, except [wd4,0-8] sometimes I can't manage the matter at all.
Sleeping and eating are the good was [wd7,6-15] for forgeting [fm1,-] the unhappy things, but the best was is trying to make myself happy, not angrying [wd2,-] for a small thing.
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS INVERNTION [fm1,-] .
And he was going to give his invention to the two men from the goverment [fm1,-] , in order that everyone would be able to benefit from it.
but [fm3,-] two impostors shut the two men from the goverment [fm1,-] and came to the professor's house to take away the invention.
They pretended [vp1,1-2] very well, and they believed that nobody could recognize them.
They thought that they had been success [wd2,6-0] !
But the old professor was more clever [aj3,1-0] than the two impostors.
Now I unstand [fm1,-] that the health is the base [wd3,-] of studying or working.
I has planed [fm2,-] where I would [vp6,7-10] go to play with my friends and how I spent every day.
I enjoyed myself when I thought [vp2,2-1] this, even in the exam.
In facts [np2,1-0] , they gave me much interesting [wd2,4-0] :when I saw the windows that were washed, I felt so happy.
Today, I read an interesting story, it was talked [wd5,-] about: A young man had a new girl friend.
When the young man saw how much he had to pay, his face turned [wd4, -2] white as a paper.
To children, the most happy [aj3,2-0] day in a year is the Spring Festival.
In my childhood, I wondered why the Spring Festival was so special and all the people were different as usual [wd7,-] .
Now I am sixteen, not as [wd5,-] a little girl.
When I grow up, I unstand [fm1,-] my father is strict with me.
Perhaps he thinks I am not a child and I can unstand [fm1-] [cc3,2-2] many thinks [fm1,-] ,he talks with me more than before.
In fact, my father like [vp3,2-1] smiling.
Sometimes he says [wd3,-] the joke to us.
He like [vp3,1-2] writing poems.
Otherwise, my Chinese maybe [ad1,2-4] is very good now.
He is espected for this by my mother and I [pr4,4-0] .
But in my heart, he is great.But in his heart,what he beleives me [,7-0] ?
It was [vp6,1-8] our turn to be on duty this week.
it wasn't [vp6,1-3] the first time.
It was a hard and troublesome work [np5,4-0] .
I think that we needn't do the cleaning so tiresome [wd2,-] at that time.
But I haven't gone [wd3,2-5] to it for some time.
 [vp6,-] The feeling which the nature gives for is new [cc4,9-] and happy.
I must wear a pair of glass [np6,3-0] when I have class.
I can't see the whiteboard so well without the glass [np6,9-0] .
I still didn't do the eye exercise, and still put my head low when I did my homewoek [fm1,-] .
they [fm3,-] must wear the glass [np6,3-0] , too.
In [wd3,0-2] Monday morning our headmaster will meet them and will introuduce our school' condition.
In the evening, we will take a party in the room [fm3,-] 402.
On wensday [fm1,-] we will have a meeting.
I was eager to grasp how to ride bike [np7,1-] .
though [fm3,-] I often got a heavy fall, I ill learn [vp6,8-3] by my heart.
One day, I first rided [fm2,-] the bike following my father on the street.
Who it it [wd6,-] ?
" "What's the matte [fm1,-] ?
"Oh, no matter [np1,1-] .
But since you want to talk with me, I will give [cc3,-2] some face to you.
We saw two men fright [wd3,4-0] .
only [fm3,-] for this, they quarrelled at first, then they didn't give in.
at [fm3,-] last they fought.
" Oh..." I wondered: weren't [fm3,-] the two men foolish?
In Grangzhou [fm1,-] which is a beautiful modern city, there are some people like these.
And how I regretted [wd2,-] at that time!
Why not think it over before I did it?now [fm3,-] perhaps my mum has forgotten this thing.
I can't pardon myself in [wd3,4-2] some time.
So I know what I can do is treat [vp6,8-3] my mother well.
I decide trying [vp5,2-5] my best to do it, and I will not make her sad any longer.
He lelf [fm1,-] us forever!
When I heard his bad news, my heart [cc2,-1] sang.
I remembered he had given a talk to us on a meeting about the problem two years before [wd3,2-0] .
When I came into the school, I felt the air was special [wd3,-1] fresh.
My school had [vp6,2-0] three high buildings.
Though my school had [vp6,1-4] thirty-six classes and there [wd5,1-3] a wide playground .
It was very valuable for students to develop their body [np6,3-0] .
Seeing all the things, I could imagine how wonderful were [wd1,5-7] the following days which I would have.
It said [vp7,1-12] that there were many famous men and women graduating in my school.
That [pr2,0-6] is valuable for students to develop their bodies.
Now my school has thirty six [fm2,-] classes, one thousand eight hundred [fm2,-] students and two hundred teachers.
When you come into the gate of the People's Park, you may go down the rode [fm1,-] which is near a small river.
So a few minutes later, you well find [vp6,2-5] a bridge over the river.
When you reach the foot of the small hill, you should turn [wd3,s-] over the hill.
After doing that, you can see a small woods [np6,2-0] , then, we will wait [vp2,2-4] on you in it.
I still remember the last time that [pr5,6-7] I swam was about ten years ago.
He is one point seven three meters high and seventy kilogram [np6,1-0] .
He is fond of music and is goot [fm1,-] at sports.
I think everyone in our class wants to improve your [pr3,7-1] lesson.
Now, I'll tell [cc3,1-5] you a piece of advice.
A piece of advice on how to improve you [pr4,3-1] lesson is "Make notes ".
" For example, in English class, teacher [np6,0-2] always writes some important things in [wd3,4-1] blackbord.
 [np7,1-] We must "Take notes".
It was [vp6,1-7] a month since the new term began.
We clean the school every week, but I always find [cc3,-1] dirty in some place.
I think it must be make [vp7,5-3] by few [np8,7-1] students.
we [fm3,-] must look on our school as our home, and make it clean.
Guang Zhou's [fm2,-] weather
beg [fm3,-] you to hear my explain.
I think everyone have [vp3,1-4] the same to [wd3,3-] me.
But when some time had ted [fm1,-] ,the weather changed quickly.

The weather is hot and the sun is shining [vp6,8-0] .After 800 metre's running, he was so tired that he couldn't keep the high peed.
Suddenly he felt [wd3,2-4] down on the ground.
Finally he raise [vp6,2-4] up and continued running.
Everyone claped their [pr3,2-1] hands.
However he was the last to the end, but he just like [wd7,11-2] the winner.

But we do not take [cc5,-4] our fate lying down.
One candle likes [wd2,2-4] very small and ordinary.
If we leave the teacher, we will have [cc3,2-2] no knowledge, become [wd4, 7-2] very silly, as if a man who can not see.
He handed a stick, which was Hanging [vp7,s-] bananas.
But the elephant didn't be interested [vp2,4-3] in the bananas, and went on playing with the ball.
After a moment, the man brought a basket, which filled [vp7,3-7] with apples, pears, mangoes, tomatoes and oranges.
To everyone's surprise, the elephant immediately put away the ball, and walk [vp6,8-3] away the ground.
On fact [np2,1-0] , to practise running, a long run, on the playground .
Everyone in the class must love it from his heart, must consider it as important as his life, and serve it whenever [wd3,3-0] .
Many boys in our class liked [vp6,5-4] football since Senior 1.
But also watched a football match on TV on holiday [,20-0] .
Now, football in our class has good chance to develop. [cc4,-3] .
Su Wei jie's coming makes everyone very joyful, particularly is [wd5,9-3] Liang Jian ling.
we [fm3,-] all believe tomorrow will be better.
To [pp2,-2] our surprised, Liang Jian ling didn't finish the homework twice this week.
So as soon as the winter comes, "bear" will become very luzy [fm1-] , this is reasonable.
Today, two practical [cc4,1-1] teachers are going back to their school.
Because they are as old as us nearly [ad1,6-0] , we regard them as friends more than teachers.
let's remember these two particular [cc4,1-1] friends for ever.
We learned a text calls [vp4,4-4] "Zhu Fu" days ago.
She was a working wowan [fm1,-] who was ppressed before liberation.
After her husband had died, Xiang Lin Sao [fm3,-] didn't take her fate lying down.
From now on, we should more [ad1,1-1] love [cc3,3-2] our living, [wd4,10-1] study harder.
our [fm3,-] class is an excellent upward collective.
Till the head teacher promised she would give reward to the students who is [vp3,8-7] willing to do it in moral education, some one tried to be the first to do.
Collective belong [vp3,1-4] to all of us.
They must regard our class as their permanent destianation [fm1,-] .
On the other hand, we make a statement: we welcome everyone to join our class, so long as they [pr3, 10-6] love this collective in the heart, willingly and gladly serve it.
otherwise [fm3,-] they are persona non grata.
this would be a majoy [fm1,-] event in our class's democratic life.
to [fm3,-] our class, such a special collective, having a group of competent cadres is very important.
I hope this electioneering [fm1,-] will be successful.
The elected cadres must have served all the classmates, led our class to be flourishing [wd3,-] .
When it was eleven o'clock, the police telephoned that the right men who came from London had been kidnaped [fm1,-] on their way to Professor Hunter's house.
To [pp2,-2] everyone's surprised, Professor Hunter said that it was not necessary to catch that two men.
He explained that the papers that two men had taken was [vp3,10-2] not important... At last, Professor Hunter decided to take the real papers to London himself.
constitution [fm3,-] [pr1,-] stipulates: "Citizen enjoys criticism, proposal, petition, complaint and accusation right [np6,8-0] .
The propagandist have [vp3,2-5] already constituted [cc3,0-3] the blackmail crime.
On the other hand, when the propagandist published stumping [wd3,-1] speech, he said that he would propagate the football gratis.
Now, he have [vp3,1-5] gone back on his word, he have [vp3,1-0] deceived us.
teacher calls [vp7,4-3] " Long Sea, Thunder".
That he is tall and powerful, also shows that he comes from the [wd5, 1-2] North China.
They over [wd7,1-6] believe the people at our side, like the teachers who taught us before.
They even composed a ci peom [fm1,-] again.
Our head teacher and we had thought that there could be four programs enter [vp4,5-2] the finals.
Long long [wd6,-] ago, there was a famous prime minister in China.
he called Wei zheng [vp7,3-0] .
I didn't write it only ask for help [,7-0] .
Miss Lin, " good advice jars on the ear helps [wd4,6-4] to do things better", do you know?
It is impossible that a student has not pressure [cc1,4-] in the exam.
Being a student in the emphasis class [cc4,1-0] , the pressure [cc3,1-5] I have had is bigger.
Especially is family [,2-0] , because the parents all hope their children will have a bright future.
The strong sense of responsibility drove me to study more harder [ad3,1-0] .So the pressure the head teacher gave [cc3,5-5] me helps me to victory.
That is to say, I must tank [wd3,2-1] her.
My winter holiday is very brief, but it enough [ad1,1-3] makes me busy.
Innumerable holiday homeworks [np5,2-0] , preparing the coming new year, preparing the new term ... all of these must be done in thirteen days.
Free and unrestrained living don't [vp3,4-5] belong to me at all.
So I don't get [vp2,2-4] more interest in it as I grow up.
Some of these flowers feel [cc2,4-1] fragrant, others look very beautiful.
Though the Spring Festival is during my winter holiday, I can't be happy to my heart's content, because I have to hurry to do my holiday home works [np5,4-0] .
On february [fm3,-] the third, I saw a piece of good news in the Yang [fm2,-] Cheng [fm2,-] Evening Paper.
though [fm3,-] they needn't do homework, and needn't support the parents scold, the teachers still felt very tired and made their head swim.
After copying the students' example, the teachers generally said that the students was [vp3,7-4] really tired and suffering.
They also said that the knowledge which the students taught [vp7,-] is dry [aj3,-2] as dust, and needed mechanical memorizing.
Someone even said that if things go on like this, students aren't able to become talents who needs [vp7,7-5] in twenty-first century.
The fierce wind hug [vp3,3-10] layers of billow, and ferociously throw them to the cliff.
The sea catches the lightning, and lets them [pr3,7-5] go out in their abyss.
She hinted that young students cannot [vp6,5-4] have a love affair.
At that time, we must hand in 65 yuan before travelling to Xi Qiao [fm2,-] Hill.
But some of us took a sceptical [fm1,-] attitude on handing in so much money.
In all fairness, our grade master care [vp3,3-4] for us very much.
So we intentionaly [fm1,-] trouble her, too.
the [fm3,-] confrontation Again.
He regarded the grade master as a tiger which [pr5,8-7] didn't let boys or girls love together.
what did his [pr4,2-1] mean?
Remember, the world relongs [fm1,-] to them and me.
It is at a quarter past six on Monday morning that I writer [wd2,1-2] this arcticle [fm1,-] .
That is to say, I have been [vp6,2-8] asleep for five hours in the past evening.
In fact, on Saturday evening and Sunday day and night, I few [wd2,-] stopped writing, few [wd3,-] left my house for a walk.
Since the new term began, the time that I spent on problems and home work was more than that I had a rest---the necessary rest.I always go to bed late at night, and get up much earlier than any [wd5,14-1] others.
on [fm3,-] the other hand, their teacher don't [vp3,2-4] let them play football in most of their spare time.
Because their teacher think [vp3,2-0] that this will affect their study .
I think these two opinion [np6, 2-0] are all [pr6,6-1] right.
After either the students or their teacher knows this piece of reason, what they can only do is understand [vp4,6-2] each other.
Such a slogan, like the opium, puzzled and poison [vp6,8-9] some of our classmates since it came into being.
Though this slogan is seldom talked of by us now, it has already taken root among [wd3,5-3] our hearts deeply.
Our class cadre is [vp6,3-2] too many.
But s a public, I find that some of them are very at ordinary times [wd7,10-0] .
They are not arctive [fm1,-] in helping the students whose study is not very good.
On the other hand, some of the cadres made [vp6,4-2] mistakes recently.
I also find that some of his characters is [vp3,4-2] as mine.
So our homeland is the largest country in the [wd5,7-1] Asia, and one of the largest countries in the world.
Our country has rich minecals [fm1,-] , aquatic resources, natural forests and water power resources.
When they descended the hill, they choose [vp6,6-3] a wrong way, o that they had to walk a long way.
This made them went back home late and tired [,8-0] .
But she thought it is [vp3,4-2] a challenge.
now [fm3,-] , I am good at walking even a very long way.
I can say in pride if I had walked the same way with those classmates that day, I would not feel [vp8,15-11] tired, and I could urge them to walk faster and faster.
It will cause the accident damage to us, like wound the ligament [fm1,-] and feet .
Let's walk as fast as we can, so that we can pursue the sun --- the brilliantest [fm1,-] victory.
When I was in Senior one [fm3,-] , I often took photos of my classmates.
For examply [fm1,-] , even on the day when school opened, I took photos of them, in order to cause them to notice me.
And after the photos were developed and printed, I would give the photos to each character [wd3,7-0] .As three months were past, I had already taken photos of them three times, and I had gathered more than one hundred pictures.
Then I chose fifty- four ones [pr6,5-2] from them, and made these photos into a pair of playing cards.
Altogether I spent more than ninty [fm1,-] yuan on them.
Broken Arms In the last two weeks, several matters about basketball have [vp6,9-4] happened in our class.
It was more disgusting that they led some boys who don't [vp3,10-10] belong to the No.4 Middle School into our school.
This must be said that " when those above behave unworthily [fm1,-] , those below will do the same [pr2,15-0] .
<SEX 2> <Y 7> <AGE ?> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> <WAY 2> <Title A GOOD TEACHER-STUDENT RELATIONSHIP> <SCORE 6> <SCH HENAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY> A good teacher-student relationship [np5,-] is based on respect.
Teacher [np6,-] must respect [wd4,-] student's request [np6,-] and choise [fm1,-] .
When students require teacher [np6,-] to give more out-book-knowledge [fm2,-] , teacher [np6,-] should try to add it in class.
And after class, students can [vp9,-] do their hobby [np6,-] [vp2,-] as they like while teacher can't [vp9,-] stand in their way.
The student should, in turn, respect teacher [np6,-] .
For example, when teacher [np6,-] try to satisfy [wd3,-] students, students should listen carefully and gain something from it.
When teacher [np6,-] gives students chance [np6,-] to do what they like [vp1,-] , students should try their best and do it well.
A good teacher-student relationship [np5,-] is also based on mutual understanding.
Let's suppose that if students don't do the work as [wd4,-] teacher's request [np6,-] , teacher [np6,-] should make it [wd5,-] clear the reason so that teacher [np6,-] won't wrong students.
On other hand, if teacher [np6,-] criticize students wrong [wd2,-] , students should know [wd3,-] teacher [np6,-] only wants them to study well.
By this way a good teacher-student relationship [np5,-] is built up.
It suggests that if you want to achieve something quickly, however [wd3, -s] you always can not get it.
In previous time [np6, 2-] , China wanted keenly to reach communisty [fm1,-] society early.
However, it have [vp3, 1-] made our national economic [wd2, 2-] develop slowly, and to some extents [wd3, 2-] , it did harm to [vp1, 1-4] our national economic's [fm2,-] development.
Our national economic [wd2, 2-] become [vp3, 3-] apparently better than ever.
 [fm2,-] 
There are some reason [np3, 1-] for it.
First, when someone is haste [wd2,-] , he hasn't enough time to think what he should do and how he should do.
So it will cause somebody does [vp1, 2-] what he needn't do.
On the other hand, haste makes people not know [wd1, 2-] how to do .
But [wd3, -s] all will reach nothing.
When someone is in bad mood, he willn't [fm2,-] do a good thing, so what he has do [vp9, 1-] will be waste.
For example, studing [fm2,-] English can't haste [wd2,-] .
If someone is hurry [vp9,1-] to make his English level [wd5, 1-] progress fastly [fm2,-] .
He don't [vp3, 1-] begin from base and willn't [fm2,-] learn English well.
When someone is filling a bottle with water, and he is impatient, so [wd3, -s] he makes [wd3,s-] it quickly but most of the water is [wd3, -2] dropped out of the bottle.
Then, why do [vp3, -s] haste makes [vp9, 2-] waste.
Firstly, I think, haste can makes [vp9,1-] people upset, and then influence his [pr3, s-] acts.
Secondly, once people haste [wd2,1-1] , he [pr3, s-] can not control his activeness [fm2,-] well and does things in wrong ways.
For instance, someone is haste [wd2,-] to get train [cc3, 1-] .
The time is rather limited, so he is upset, he takes his suitcase [wd4, s-] hurried to the railway station.
When he arrives at the station, he finds his ticket is forgotten [wd3, s-] in his home.
And in order to avoid it [pr1, s-] and make things good and quick, we should not haste and we ought to make calme.
 [fm1,-] [cc3, 1-] 
Someone wants to do well in it [pr1, s-] , he must grasp the principles which are in the things.
It should take [vp1, -s] man for a long time to understand it [pr1, -] .For example: a man wants to master a foreign language.
Regulerly [fm1,-] learning and reviewing is important to [wd3,s-] learn language.
Finally, he will find that he can apply it [pr1, s-] easily.
It is impossible for a man do well [wd1,1-] things in few [np8, -1] time.
There is a famous say [wd2, 2-] that haste makes waste.
In short, if one wants to finish his work as possible as he can, he will make the work even worse on the contrary [wd5,s-] .
There are many reasons that we can be found [vp7, 3-] make out [wd3, s-] .
First, if a unskilled [wd3, -1] man set [vp3, 2-] out to do some difficult work, and he is asked to finish [vp1, -] in a short time, he will be nevous [fm1,-] .
As a result, he can finish it on time.Second, one must do things in turn, then he can finish them succefully [fm1,-] .
Thinking a man do [vp5, -s] things without his rule, you can know that the sooner he wants to be, the more slowly he does it .
Finally, if someone hasn't been good [ad2, 2-1] prepared for the work, he can't do it succefully [fm1,-] .
That is to say, one must make things well-equipped [cc3, 2-] before he starts to do [vp1, -] .
We must do things in [wd3,-3] a good step.
Take it easy, as long as you are skilled and well-equipped person [np6,3-] .
Perhaps, you run into these case [np3, 1-] [cc3, 3-] .
Upside down [wd3, 1-] the room, but can't found it .
When you want to remember the words in the dictionary in several days, but [wd5, -s] the result of which is that you only remember few [wd3, -] .
The two example [np3, 1-] I list both ellustrate [fm1,-] the principle.
So it [pr2, -s] could be concluded [vp7, 2-] that [vp1, s-] .
As a proverb say [vp3, 2-] : Haste Makes Waste.
It's quite clear that a haste people [np3,2-] [cc4, 1-] can't make achievement because he [pr3, s-] hasn't prepared enough.
It [pr2, -s] is known to all of us.
However, his mother let [vp3, 2-] him run to her.
He can't reach to [vp1, 1-] her without any help.
No one can deny [vp1, -s] it cost him many time [np8, 1-] to walk well, much more time to run.
So we should think it [pr1, s-] over before we begin it [pr1, s-] .
Second, sometimes we have to do it again because of the lackless [fm2,-2] of care.
For example, when we go to school, we would bring the book and other thins [wd3, -] such as glasses.
But we forget to bring the glass before [wd3, -] of haste.
For another example, we haste [vp1, -3] do the thing again when we did [vp6, s-] it wrong.
In a word, we should do a thing careful [wd2, 3-] and think about it before we start to do it.
We usually hear [vp1, -s] that someone say to another men "Haste Make Waste".
there [fm3,-] are some reasons for it [pr1, s-] .
The [wd5,-1] first, when you have a good haste [vp2, 3-] to do something, you will have a short time to consider the other fact that will effect the thing.
It [pr2, -s] will not [vp7, -s] satisfied to yourself and others.
Second, if you have a good haste, but the other conditions can't keep up with [wd3, 3-1] you, so you must stop to wait.
To the first [pp1,2-] , it will cause you must do it again .
To the second [pp1,2-] , it will cause you spent your time in waiting .
So the two ways [wd7, 4-2] is [vp3, 2-] waste.
For example, it will have a [np7, -1] examination.
A student found [wd4, -s] he have [vp3,1-] many books not to read.
So he decided to have a quick look on [wd3,3-3] all the books.
So [wd5, -s] he will have much time.
But he don't [vp3, 1-] understand it, or he don't [vp3, 1-] catch the main point to read.
So [wd5, -s] when he get [vp3, 1-] the paper, he will find that many knowledge [np8, 1-] have being seen [vp9,2-] .
But [wd5, -s] he didn't [vp6, s-] do it because he didn't understand it.
So he waste [vp3, 1-] the time.
We can say [vp1, -s] him "Haste makes waste".
It means that you do everything should [vp1,-s] step by step , then you can get succed [fm1,-] .
For example, it's the same in learning language [np6, 1-] .
First, the student learn [vp3,2-] the letters, then words, at last, he know [vp3, 1-] how to use them to make a sentence and an article [cc3, 5-] .
During the course, the learner must work very hard, master everything he needs, such as the words, the programmer [wd3, -] and so many things.
He must [vp9, -s] very patient and has [vp9, 4-] a specific aid.
Finally, he master [vp3,1-] it.
If you do it too fast, you may make mistakes though [wd3, -s] you haven't think [vp9,1-] about it carefully.
If unfortunately [wd1, -s] you go too far from the right way, it will be very difficult to correct your mistakes.
You do everything need enough preparation and good fundamental [wd2, 1-] .
Then you will find that your former [wd3, -2] flexible fingers become dull [wd3, s-] and the mind is [vp9, -3] seemed to be stupid.
Maybe you will go out of the door to find that the key is without [wd3, -] you.
When you are in nervous [wd2, 1-] , you can do anything but success [cc3, 3-] .
The examples we can easily found [vp9, 2-] in our life.
Imagine that you have a date [wd3, 2-] and you are nearly to be late.
How embarrassed it [pr1, s-] is!
When final exams comes [vp3, 1-] , we should prepare all the lessons, we will skim all the books but don't know which one we should take first.
Some people may don't [vp9, 1-] think so.
Because we are in hasty [wd2, 1-] , we have a press [wd3, 2-] , we can't do well at last.
Everyone may happened [vp9, 1-] [wd3, 3-3] to such a situation.
When you leave home in the end, you may find that you go out without the bag [wd3, -] .
It is the haste that make [vp3, 2-] [vp1, -s] you have to go back home.
What [wd3, -s] you do quickly is only to waste your time.
Otherwise, all that we do only lead [vp3,5-] to waste.
"Haste makes waste" is a probe [wd3, -] in China.
The words is [vp3, 2-] reasonable and popular in our daylife.
 [fm1,-] When you have a task to do.
A task also [wd1, -1] may have some details you should remarkable [wd3, -] .
But you want to do the job very quickly, neglect the details, ignore the circumstance when [wd3, s-] you complete the task, perhaps many things you haven't done.
Perhaps a task consist [vp3, 2-] of several parts.
After [pp1, -1] complete all the parts you complete the task.
But [wd5, -s] perhaps you want to "Haste" [wd4, -s] you do this part and forget that part.
And the task is never complete [wd3, -] .
A job have [vp3, 2-] some fundamental factors [wd3, -] .
Just like [vp1, -1] study English.
We study English from A, B,C, to make sentence [np6, 2-] to write article.
 [np6, 1-] We should learn the idiom and grammar.
The sentences you made is wrong and you can't understand the newspaper, and it's difficulty to write article [np6, 2-] .
Only [wd5, -s] you learn many idioms and grammar, and speak and write English every day.
It means if a man wants to get the result fastly, maybe the fast leads to the unceccess [fm1,-] .
At first, everything has its natural proceed [wd3, s-] , we must obey it and should not surpass it.
Only [wd5, -s] we have done it step by step, we can succeed.
For example, when we study English, we should study the word, firstly it is the primary [wd3, -] of the [wd5, -] language.
Then we should study the grammar, then to read text [np6, 1-] and do exercise [np6, 1-] .
Such as [wd5, -s] when we have passed CET4 we can attend the test CET6.
If we want get a good mark, we must study it [pr1, s-] step by step.
Sencondly [fm1,-] , the more we do things fastly, [ad3, s-] the more mistakes or dangers will be [vp9, 1-1] appear.
For a [np7, -1] instance, if we drive a car to a place, we should obey the trafic [fm1,-] rules, otherwise we may get in trouble.
Every one want [vp3, 2-] to succeed.
Every one knows that haste make [vp3, 1-] waste.
But when you are in a competition, you will think: "oh, I must do the work better than her (him), I must also [wd4, -s] faster than her (him), faster and faster...." So you may [wd4, -s] in a fuss [wd3, s-] .
Because you are so earger [fm1,-] that you can't think over the whole thing correctly.
I remember one day when I am [vp6, -s] studying in a middle school.
It was 12 o'clock already and I wanted to have the lunch prepared half an hour later [wd5, -] before my mother went back.
Form then on, I knew that haste makes waste and that if you want to succeed, you should do everything after you have think [vp9, 1-] it over.
It is [vp9, -1] means: if you want something to be done quickly, however, it would be [vp9, 2-2] work slowly; if you want to make something done better, but [wd5, -s] it would be worse.
Why people are [vp9,-1] think of haste [vp5, -2] makes waste?
The reason is that, when someone plans to do something, he always hopes to be done [vp7, s-] excessfully [fm1,-] and eagerly, which is [vp9, -s] cause to waste [vp5, -3] time and hard [wd3, -] .
For example, in winter, students are [vp9, -2] get up late.
Because we are too late to catch the class [cc3, 2-] on time, so we want to how to quickly to save our time .
We may hurry to carry our books and notes to the classroom, but when we reach the classroom, we would find the pen left [wd4, -2] [vp7, 2-] the dormitory, or we would find we got the notes wrong [wd1, 1-] .
This is an [np7, -2] good example of [pp1,-3] haste makes waste.
In order to avoid of [wd5, -3] haste makes waste, we should do anything repairely [fm1,-] , we should not wonder [vp1,-1] the result but wonder the efficient [wd3, -] .
So, we can do everything well than [wd7, -s] haste makes waste.
Every student want [vp3, 2-] to master the knowledge in [pp1, -1] soon, but, it is only a daydream.
Study is a long course that need [vp3, 2-] people's continuing hard work and to spend plenty of time .
Understanding one article, firstly, you must master mostly words and be able to know the means [wd3, -3] of every sentence.
When you do well [wd1, -s] all kinds of basic work, you may understand an article.
At last, we get the aim or exchang [fm1,-] [wd7, -5] with time and our energy.
So, it's a rule of nature to [wd3, -3] haste make waste.
Someone think [vp3, 1-] it's very efficient that you spend little time doing things better.
Because you want to save time to do something, so [wd5, -s] you're always want [vp9,2-] to escape doing something.
But it's very unfortunately [wd2, 2-] , the something [wd3, 1-] which you want to escape is just very important part of something which [wd5, 1-2] you'll do.
So at last you not only don't finish this matter [wd3, -] , but also you spend more time.
For instance, we are in line [wd3, 1-] to buy tickets of [wd3, 3-] movie.
But there are some people [wd4, 2-5] don't keep in the line, they crash [wd3, -3] to the front [wd3,s-] .
The outcome of these action [np3, 1-] is that more and more people are crowded to buy tickets.
So I think when you dicide [fm1,-] to do something, you'd better finish it step by step.
Maybe someone can't understand [vp1, -] and asks why it is.
In ancient time [np6, 1-] , Jin country [wd3, 1-] wanted attack Song country [wd3, 1-] .
The leader ordered a soildier to make marks the day before they studied [wd3, s-] .
But the leader sticked [fm2,-] [wd3,-] to do [vp5, 2-] what he wanted.
As a result, they can't [vp6,-] find the marks which they [wd5, s-] had been destroyed by the flood [wd3, s-] .
From the story, we can know that if you want to achieve your target [cc3,2-] , you must think of all factors.
If you want to become singer [np6, 1-] , you should practise [vp1,-] everyday and ask for [vp2, -2] music teacher who will lead you to the true way [cc4,1-] .
Each success includs [fm1,-] [wd3, -2] hard work.
On the road of success, there is no easy [wd3, -] .
Our motherland needs [vp1, -3] all us to work hard for her.
Let us use our own hands to create our tomorrows [wd3,-] .
So [wd5, -s] you have to do it again.
So when I was a little girl, my parents and teachers often thought [wd3, -4] me to be cautious.
" For individual, I think it may be not [wd1, 2-] a serious thing, but if you are in a high position and change of some important things or a lot of money.
Haste will lost [vp9, 1-] [wd3, -2] you much and may lost [wd3, -] your company, your country much .
Long ago there was a young man who wanted to enter the city with his servent [fm1,-] .
They are [vp6, s-] in a boat.
 [wd4,-2] Sun was coming down so he fastened [wd3, -5] the owner of the boat, an old man.
The old man told him slowly, "If you don't fasten [wd3, -1] me I can sent [vp9, 1-] you in [wd3,-] the city before the gate closing.
If you fasten [wd3, -] , I think I can't do it.
" The young man didn't believe him, so the old man fastened [wd3, -2] his boat.
In solving a problem or doing a job, all factors are doing [cc2,2-2] its [pr3, 3-] work.
" For instance, during the preparation for the CET 6, because I have sailed [wd3, -] through the CET 4, so [wd5, -s] I thought it was just a piece of cake.
Then [wd5, -s] I tried to memorize every word in the dictionary in such a short time.
Even if I studied [wd3,-] hundreds of words [cc3, 3-] each day, when I was reading, the words that I have seen still be unknown to me.
But in [pp1, -1] true, haste make waste.
For example, we want a good marks [np3, 2-] in the test.
We couldn't learn some course in some [wd3, -1] day.
So [wd5, -s] , we can master it well and do it well.
So [wd5, -s] we can say haste makes success is impossible .
Success need [vp3, 1-] time, and energy.
So [wd5, -s] we must have good basis.
It comes from we learn some course from high school to [wd3, -] university.
So [wd5,-s] I can say if you want success quickly, you need basis [wd3, -] , energy and time.
You should learn everything which will benefit [vp1, -1] to you, to do some work in society.
In a word, we want success rapid [wd2, s-] , we need basis [wd3, -] and knowledge , otherwise [wd4, -s] , haste makes waste.
It is obvious [wd4,-s] most of persons have their own views.
There are someone [wd4,-1] reasons: some people may go in for the work; some people think it was the only work that they can do best; other people may be afraid of unemployment after they give up the origine [fm1,-] work.
Most of them want to learn well in every fields [np3,1-] .
Nowdays [fm1,-] , technology is improving [vp1,s-] quickly.
In brief, it is the society that call [vp3,1-] for people changing their work.
In my opinion, we can learn something through changing jobs, so I agree to change [vp5,2-] jobs.
And which job is [vp9,-2] he like?
Why he usually change [vp3,2-] his job?
Some people like working on [wd3,1-] a certain job.
At the same time, they get on well with their workmates [fm2,-] .
They wouldn't like to make new friends again at [wd3,-2] other company.
And it'll take them some time to adapt [vp1,-s] to new environment [np6,1-] .
Otherwise [wd3,-s] , some people like changing jobs constantly.
And they can do many things to avoid losing job [np6,1-] .
In general, I like stable job [np6,1-] .
But do people like it [pr1,s-] ?
Here are some news [np5,2-] .
Someone like [vp3,1-] [vp1,1-2] do one job all along.
More important is that workmates [fm2,-] are familiar to each other.
However, someone change [vp3,1-] their jobs constantly.
You may go on with it [pr3,s-] , it is good for your future.
Nowdays [fm1,-] most of us like to work.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to go in for a stationary work, while others like to change their jobs at one time.
Someone tend [vp3,1-] to do a simlar [fm1,-] job.
They just like to have a stationary condition, they also consider that they have to do a simlar [fm1,-] job because of studying something.
Someone hold [vp3,1-] the contrary idea, ie.
they like to do a unsimlar [fm2,-] job at the unsimlar [fm2,-] time.
They think they can get some unsimilar [fm2,-] experience.
 [fm1,-] Because I like business, but not like science to study.
Many people want to take up job [np6,1-] unchanged through their life.
Usually, people want to take unchanged job [np6,1-] for such reasons: they enjoy their own job; they want to live stable life [np6,1-] ; they want to be more skilled in their job.... Of couse [fm1,-] , some people do not want to change their job only because they are afraid of not finding a new job.
Some of them are always unsatisfied with their job, the others, especially young staff may change their job for this reason, they want to live adventering [fm1,-] life, want to experience new life.
In my view, to a young man, more experience to various jobs will be helpful to enhance his composition [wd3,1-] , and will benefit [vp1,-1] to his capability to adapting [vp5,1-] new circumstance.
But we must be seriously [wd2,-] when we decide to change our job.
Some people like doing the same job from begin [wd2,1-2] to end.
Some people like doing the same job, also because they like stabling [wd3,1-] .
Perhaps, the job is not very satisfacting [fm2,-] , but they will do it for ever, because they don't like always changing their jobs.
However, some people like changing their jobs from time and [pp2,2-1] time.
Because they feel doing the same job is dulling [fm2,-] .
In new enviornment [fm1,-] , they can find a lot of interesting things.
I think, the two kinds of people have a different characters [np3,2-] .
Some people always like taking on a kind of [wd3,2-] job.
They may specialize in the major about job [np6,1-] on campus.
Second, After they start to work, as times [wd3,1-] pass, they are proficiency [wd2,2-] in the job gradually.
They are [vp9,-1] worried that there are some difficulties once they change the job.
They always can be confidence [wd2,-] in overcoming the obstacles in the jobs.
They want to learn more knowledge and work experiences so, they can sum up the experience so as to acheive [fm1,-] great success.
But I think we youth should take on a challenging job, we have encourage [wd3,1-] and ability to adapt [vp1,-1] to the change of scientity [fm1,-] .
After we accumulate the work [cc3,2-] , experiences, we may select [vp1,-1] to the interesting job.
But it is diffirent [fm1,-] from some persons to others about Job-Hopping [fm3,-] .
They consider that the convert [wd3,1-1] job will bring you a fresh sense, thus you can find our potential energy constantly.
It seem [vp3,1-] to be reasonable for both the views.
But I think parts of the two view [np3,1-] are right, and parts wrong.
It [pr1,-s] has diffirent [fm1,-] traits from person to person, some persons with these traits will suit [vp1,-1] for [pp1,-3] do the same job all along, but some persons with those traits will suit [vp1,-1] for the changes work.
Because some of them like the work that they do really [wd5,s-] , they decide to devote themselies [fm1,-] to the work.
But some of them just don't want to lost [vp5,1-] the work to do another, they do it not for [wd3,1-] they like it.
Because they like challenge, they want to proved [vp5,1-] that they can do any work if they like.
Because the characteries [fm1,-] of people is diffierent [fm1,-] , some like chanlleage [fm1,-] and they want to [wd4,-2] the work they never to [vp4,2-1] do.
To our young people, we should to [vp9,1-1] learn more and not just to be locked in the work we are.
Some think they always work [wd4,-3] the same surrounding, relationships and companions are familar [fm1,-] to them.
Maybe they like the challeging [fm1,-] change.
I think there are advantages and disavantays [fm1,-] in two ways.
If you feel present job [np6,1-] isn't satisfied [wd3,1-] or you want to learn different field [wd4,-1] knowledge, you should change it as soon as possible.
At last, I hope everyone find [vp3,1-] a job that you like as soon as possible.
What are the reason [np3,2-] for this?
The people who always does [vp3,3-] the same job usually thinks [vp3,s-] : In [fm3,-] his life, his income is stable, which means that he has a steady life, what he must do is concentrate his mind on his job, maybe, will be fruitful of his work.
These [pr1,s-] usually think, through changing [vp1,-1] to job [np6,1-] , more various experience could be got by him.
It is also a problem facing [vp1,-1] to me that what kind of job I should choose.
In my opinion, changing jobs is very benefitful [fm2,-] for young person [np6,1-] , especially for the person like me, because this will make a person get more.
Some like to do [vp1,-1] with the same job for good.
By [pp1,-2] practise longly [fm1,-] , they can master it and do it very well.
The other factor is that one find [vp3,1-] a very good job or he likes it very much.
Others favorit [fm1,-] change the job oftenly [fm2,-] .
These people hope his life lively and their jobs challengable [fm1,-] .
But I think if someone changes his job more oftenly [fm2,-] , he couldn't do them [pr3,s-] well.
So I'm for [pp1,-2] stick with [vp2,1-2] a job which suit [vp3,3-] you [pr1,s-] very much and do it precisely.
I'll find out my favorit [fm1,-] job and devote my life to it.
Some people like to engaging [vp5,1-] in a job consistently.
Especially, if you have studies [vp9,1-2] some certain subjects, you must want to do a relative job to testify how do you study.
While [cj1,-s] , other people prefer to change [vp1,2-2] their jobs frequently.
I agree with [wd3,1-3] the first opinion, ie.
Someone like [vp3,1-] [vp1,1-3] do a job from [pp1,-2] begin to end.
Another reason is that they like stability and they think changing job [np6,1-] is too tired.
They don't want [vp1,-1] make [wd3,-s] themselves into troubles.
But the other one like [vp3,1-] change [vp1,3-1] job [np6,1-] constantly.
They like [vp1,-1] see how much are their abilitys [fm1,-] .
They want [vp1,-1] trying in various regions.
When we change jobs, we must think if it is suitable to me [pr3,s-] .
As soon as we find a job that we like and we are interesting [aj4,-1] in this scales, we should do it continuely [fm2,-] until we contribute [wd3,1-1] ourselves.
Others also think that taking a stable job means he needn't worry about losing job [np6,1-] in a respective [wd3,1-] long time.
In a word, they focouse [fm1,-] on the stability.
However, someone like [vp3,1-] to take a job for his life, because is afraid of adopting [wd3,1-] to the new working places.
Also, he hasn't the ability to receive new technoledges [fm1,-] .
The reason may be that: the present work doesn't suit [vp1,-1] to him, and he thinks the job cann't [fm1,-] prove his abilitys [fm1,-] .
If the job is very suitale [fm1,-] to me, why should I change the job?
Some people work on [wd3,1-2] one job all their life, because they think there are many benifits [fm1,-] in this.
in [fm3,-] China, people who do not want to move their jobs [cc3,2-] .
all [fm3,-] always think the relatinship [fm1,-] with others, the house, the chirld [fm1,-] , so they are stable.
But some other people urually [fm1,-] work from one job to another.
They want to study more and have more friends, or they want to find the well [wd3,1-1] place that they can work, or even they want to travl [fm1,-] from one city to another, one country to another by this way.
Because I want [vp1,-1] learn more about this world.
I think I can do well by [wd3,-2] this way.
Today, many people would like to do the same job all at last [wd3,1-] .
They think that a steady job will bring him [pr3,s-] a steady life.
But another [wd3, -1] people don't like steady job [np6,2-] .
Most of them want to chang [fm1,-] their life through changing the job.
My view on job-hopping is to find a job adapted [wd3,1-2] to myself by changing job [np6,1-] consicently [fm1,-] and then insist [vp1,-1] it on [pp2,-2] my life, in order to realize my order [wd3,1-3] in my life.
There is such a words [np3,1-] , "Happiness consist [vp3,1-] in work," so people all over the world like to work.
The attitude on [wd3,1-] the job, among them, can be divided into two groups.
One is the persons who take up a job for all his or her [pr3,s-] life, the other is the people who enjoy [vp1,-1] change jobs from time to time, from one place to another....
According to a questionaire [fm1,-] , the former group is one who is traditional.
Because we live in society, a steable [fm1,-] work may make our life comfortable.
You would not consider much of [wd5,1-] futher [fm1,-] .
So [wd5,-s] everyday you are in good mood to go [vp1,-1] work.
The second class may be called up up-to-date persons [cc4,1-] .
They like to meet challege [fm1,-] rather than like [vp1,-1] for one job for ever.
They think the value of man consist [vp3,3-] in overwhelming all the difficities [fm1,-] [cc3,3-] and all the challege [fm1,-] .
They think there are so many opportunies [fm1,-] in their life.
In other words, their work full of venture [wd3,1-] , full of challege [fm1,-] , full of interesting.
In my opiny [fm1,-] , I should choose the one.
For a girl, I hope I succedd [fm1,-] .
Some people like [vp1,-1] work at [wd3,1-] a sort of work in their work-life [fm2,-] .
Because they think people shouldn't change his work or he [pr3,s-] will work unsuccessfully.
The reason is people wouldn't atention [fm1,-] on the work.
But, some people often like [vp1,-s] change their work at [wd5,-1] sometimes and in [wd5,-1] somewhere.
I had work at saleing [fm1,-] shopping [wd3,1-] and teaching a pupil English and mathimatic [fm1,-] .
I know some people and make their [wd3,1-] into my friend.
So, you have listened [vp6,-s] to me, if you were I [pr4,s-] , you wouldn't like [vp1,-1] change your work frequently.
There appear [vp1,-s] some different points on job-hopping.
Others would like to change their jobs, perhaps because they like much challege [fm1,-] which shows their abilities.
 [cc3,2-] I like challege [fm1,-] .
I think two jobs are fit [vp1,1-2] with me.
But I don't mean I go in for they [pr4,s-] at the same time.
I would like go in for [wd3,2-] a job for some years, then find another job which is a challege [fm1,-] for me.
I think it not only train my ability [cc3,-] to adapt [vp1,-s] to the society but also proves my experence [fm1,-] ability.
I like it [pr1,s-] .It is an opinion of one.
Job [np6,1-] is important to us.
They think, when one do [vp3,1-] a job for a few years, he(she) would be skilled with the job, and in the following years, he(she)can do the job easily and does [vp3,s-] the job better easily [wd6,s-] .
Another kind of people likes [vp3,4-] to change job [np6,1-] now and then, when they do a job for some times [wd3,1-] , they have no interest in the job, and then they change their jobs.
Sometime [wd2,-] , people change their jobs only because they want to find a job with more pay.
As I said above, when one do [vp3,1-] a job for some time, he(she) would be similar [wd3,1-] with the job.
On the contrary, if one often change [vp3,2-] his job, it is difficult for him to apply to the job at the beginning.
In their opinion, as a man who has enterprised [aj4,-1] heart, he should continue his course to the end no matter how tough it is.
They believe that where there is a will there is a way and that success belongs to those who can stick to his cause with perseverance spirit [wd5,1-] .
Because they like fresh sense [wd3,1-] and dislike to the same thing unceasingly.
They think that repeating one work is a dull thing, which will make them lose enegy [fm1,-] and desire to [wd3,1-] working, and it is important to have enegy [fm1,-] and desire of work.
It is up to individual decide [wd2,s-] .
The most important thing for us is to take up the work we favoriat [fm1,-] and attain the aim that realize our personal social value and serve our country.
Some people like [vp1,-1] take a job for ever.
They feel that everything they do is very interesting, second, some of them think: their jobs are good enough and can earn good money, so they needn't [vp9,-1] to change them.
Third, some of them take their jobs they are good at, while other jobs are not familar [fm1,-] to them.
The other is they the jobs are rountine [fm1,-] and they want some interesting and challengeble [fm1,-] jobs to do.
For job [np6,1-] , I think, we should first make a goal and we decide to do for [wd5,1-] it.
Therefore I want everyone like the job really, and do good for it [pr1,s-] .
It is due for [wd3,1-] they think that they can improve skill, accumulate experience, then lead to higher efficiency.
But some people don't think that, they would change job [np6,1-] usually [wd3,1-] rather than stay in the same position or the same company.
Their causes are who engages in one job too long will tiresome, No [fm3,-] curiousity [fm1,-] , No [fm3,-] freshment [fm2,-] , then people feel [wd5,-s] will lose passion gradually.
My view on job-hoping is that people should stay in the same company, which will enhance [vp1,-5] one skillful, acquaint with equipment technology and apparatus, so can bring sophisticated manipulating.
Usually changing job [np6,1-] might not find the best position, but may make one no gain finally.
Some person liked to work [vp1,-s] about the same jobs.
They could work in the same skills [wd3,1-] .
Another persons [np3,1-] liked to change their jobs.
They thought they could find a better job from changing it [pr1,s-] .
They liked to learn more skills in different job [np6,1-] .
I think it is important to us that we learn a job skill [cc1,1-] .
You can find wether [fm1,-] you like your work or not through a long time.
If you are sure that it is not fit for you, you may change [wd3,-3] a new job.
Nowadays, with the social reform and more oppotunity [fm1,-] , more and more people have been changing their jobs frequently.
The reason of job-hopping may be various [aj5,s-] from poorly-paid [wd7,-] , bad wording condition to less challenging.
As everything has two sides, There [fm3,-] are also a large number of people, esp.
aged people, who prefer [vp1,-s] their present job rather than get a new one.
They enjoy the long-established relations around and dislike a totally strange enviorment [fm1,-] .
My opinion is that; as long as the job is not suitable for you, I mean you can't use your talent and ability to the full measure [wd3,1-] or there isn't any hope for you to be promoted, surely you have the right to change you [wd3,-1] job.
But there is also a precondition ie [fm1,-] , whenever, you should work hard and try your best and then you have the right to say that the work isn't fit for you or is not worthwhile.
Otherwise, you don't deserv [fm1,-] any opportunity.
If someone finds [vp1,-s] the company worse in business, he will want to leave and look for another it.
These persons mainly consider his [pr3,s-] own income.
They say that the head of the company doesn't take care of them and these will lead the company to be over [wd7,s-] .
My idea is that if the company is advantage to develop us, we should not only look upon [wd3,1-] the money but we should work hard for it [pr1,s-] .
Every adults [np3,1-] is working every day.
On the other hand, some people prefer [vp1,-s] change their job constantly.
The reason is that they can maintain full energy in different envirements [fm1,-] .
What's more, new jobs are of a chanllege [fm1,-] to them.
In my opinion, these two thought are very commen [fm1,-] and understandable.
You may be like the first one [pr1,s-] .
Therefore, you have a good feeling to put into your job every day and result in a good achievment [fm1,-] .
You will realize your amibitious [fm1,-] during continous [fm1,-] changing.
I guees [fm1,-] that these thought may be more adaptable [wd3,-] to young person.
In the highly competitive market economy, most of us faces [vp3,3-] [vp1,-1] with the difficulty of getting a job.
Finding a job is not only a challengement [fm2,-] but also a chance to testing [vp9,1-] our abilities.
They think that it is not easy to grasping [vp9,1-] skills.
Stable job can make them be [wd5,s-] more familiar with enviornment [fm1,-] so that they may do it very well, many of us agree with [wd3,1-] this idea.
The traditional thoughts greatly influene [fm1,-] us now.
In my opinion to this [wd5,1-] , As [fm3,-] with every problem, there are two sides about this.
Engaging in doing one job in one's life is as not [wd1,1-] favorable as changing jobs frequently.
One must think carefully when she or he want [vp3,1-] to get a new job.
Diffirent [fm1,-] people has [vp3,1-] diffirent [fm1,-] job-hopping acording [fm1,-] to their diffirent [fm1,-] chericters [fm1,-] .
Some people prefers [vp3,2-] a job in [wd3,-4] which he would devote all his life in [wd5,s-] just because his loved the job.
This kind of person have [vp3,1-] a comon [fm1,-] cherictoristics [fm1,-] that they are thorough [aj5,s-] in doing their jobs and they don't like the changed positions in their lives.
This kind of person perfer [fm1,-] chanlenge [fm1,-] life.
They always looking for a job which has better conditions and the higher selories [fm1,-] .
In my opinon [fm1,-] , I want a job which suits me best.
Because jobs are not only the methord [fm1,-] depending on which you will survive but also a way you will put you ideal into realistics [fm2,-] .
So you must love this job when you do it and you can do something which is really benefical [fm1,-] to our soceirty [fm1,-] .
No metter [fm1,-] whether you will change your job, loving your job is more important.
If you love it, you will proberly [fm1,-] step on the road which leads to your success.
Some people like to do one job all their lifes [fm2,-] .
Second I think some of these people are not willing to change their jobs though they proberbly [fm1,-] dislike their jobs.
Because these people have much ambition and thy want to show [wd3,-1] themselves and want to achieve somethings [fm2,-] .
Before I get a job I must make [vp1,-s] me to be a useful and skilled men.
On the other hand, if the job isn't excited [aj4,-1] to me I will consider [vp1,-1] to change one.
Thus, we cannot often change our job and when we become older and older we can do a lot and do successful [wd2,s-] .
These are my view [np3,1-] on Job-Hopping.
So there are many different views on Job-Hopping in people.Some people like to take only one job in his all [wd1,1-] life for they would not like to move from one place to another and they could have a stable income.
Some people would like to change job [np6,1-] from time to time, for they like to recept [fm1,-] challenge and make their life instresting [fm1,-] .
My view on job-hopping is different with [aj2,1-] the people that have mentioned [vp7,2-] .
I like to change job [np6,1-] several years when I start to work, but not oftenly [fm2,-] .
From the challenge I could inhance [fm1,-] my capacity and experience.
When over forty, I would choose one job that I like best to take and take it until I retire, so that I could have a stable life in the left [wd1,-1] time.
I would be very glad if you have the same view with me and I hope everyone have [vp3,1-] their own view on Job-Hopping and each of them has a good life.
Allmost [fm1,-] everyone has a job.
Some like doing a job in his [pr3,6-] holelife [fm1,-] , some like [vp1,-1] change his [pr3,3-] job as he [pr3,s-] like [vp3,1-] .
Those who like doing a job in his holelife [fm1,-] because he [pr3,s-] like the job.
They know exectly [fm1,-] what they are and their own fellings [fm1,-] .
They do not want to be in the world unknow [fm1,-] .
And some like [vp1,-1] change their jobs have some kind of view.
They maybe [wd3,1-] do not like the job they are doing.
They maybe [wd3,-1] want to challenge themselves.
They maybe [wd3,-1] want to be high [wd2,-] payed [fm2,-] .
They maybe [wd3,-1] want to live in different place [np6,3-] .
Maybe they are the felling [fm1,-] .
They trust their felling [fm1,-] , Maybe there are something unknow [fm1,-] .
But if I do not get the job I like, I maybe [wd3,-1] change the job.
If the job I do is not the job I like I still be remine [fm1,-] if they do need me.
There are some responsbilities [fm1,-] you can not foget [fm1,-] .
But they will be effiently [fm1,-] with time [wd4,1-1] on.
They are used to doing some kind of work and are disvadtage [fm1,-] than the other.
Once work is changed, they are often that they can not adjust themslve [fm1,-] .
Other [wd3,-s] like to change work.
To them, it is a [np7,-1] enjoy [wd2,-] when do some different jobs.
They are tiresome [wd3,1-2] of working a single job long time.
But if one does a single job in his life, he can not study more, and enlarge his skills [cc3,2-] .
I think that one should do the job that he like [vp3,1-] , if his condition change [vp3,1-] , he may find other work.
Since they recived [fm1,-] one job.
He looks [vp1,-1] the job his second life and devote all [wd5,-1] himself into [wd3,1-] the work.
He works very hard, foucucing [fm1,-] all his attentions on the factor [wd3,1-] , throwing his sweat [cc3,-] on the field and seldom.
This kind of people cann't [fm1,-] do better in their life.
Another kinds [np3,1-] of people like to change their work frequently.
Their life-long period, they can't know what's achieviment [fm1,-] but they may get full experience in their life.
On [pp2,-2] my opinion, I do these two kind of people and not do them too.
In my former [wd3,1-1] life I change my work to get experience and in my later life-time.
I do in one word [wd3,1-] to get achievenment [fm1,-] .
Today, with the development of society, all kinds of jobs are constantly occured [vp1,s-] [fm1,-] .
So everyone has some chances to choose itself [wd5,-1] job.
Because they like the job more than else others [wd5,1-] ; they want to devote themselves the working; they want to gain some great sucess [fm1,-] in this aspect.
They type of people has a [np7,-1] only belief.
They believe that they is [vp3,1-] looking for [vp1,1-2] themselves valueness [fm2,-] from all kinds of jobs and attempts.
The type of people can soon adopt [wd3,-s] to all kinds of different envirmental [fm1,-] .
They believed that they have some ability to adopt [wd3,-2] to the society.
So they attempt to work on all kinds of jobs to check [wd3,-1] themselves.
But I believe that every one should have itself [wd5,-1] belief.
As we step into the society, maybe we can't recive [fm1,-] a [np7,-1] agreeable job, but we shouldn't give up, we finally find a [np7,-1] agreeable job to fit [vp1,-2] for itself.
But as we find the job, we should insist on [wd3,1-] it, we should devote ourselves to it and gain some success by our working.
My view on job Hopping [fm3,4-2] is that has a fittness [fm1,-] job.
I want to look for a good job, then I will devote myself into [wd3,2-] it.
Some people like to do the same work all life, because they consider that they can do the work skilled [wd2,s-] by long time training.
And they needn't adapt [vp1,-4] to another new job.
So they have enough time to do other thing [np6,1-] they like.
I think that the career one person work [vp3,1-] on [wd3,1-] is defined by his characteristic [wd3,s-] .
Once you like your work, you will all through [wd5,1-] keep up with doing it.
Because I think [vp1,-s] it important to do their best to do well in what they should do.
Somebody like [vp3,1-] their work, even they conviece [fm1,-] it as the best important thing in their life.
Even though, there are many people who would like to often [wd1,-3] change their work.
In order to abtain [fm1,-] many more chances, they will select another work with no hestate [fm1,-] .
My view on Job-Hopping is that only you think you need a new condition, you are going to creat [fm1,-] it, if you think [vp1,-s] it not necessary, you'd better stay in the place where you stayed at first.
I think that chance is all in our heads if we make good use of our chance, we will "go" further [fm1,-] .
Some people like to engage [vp1,-s] a kind of job all their lives, because they considered that the same job could permit them to do the job with enough times [wd3,1-] , for example a man might started his cooking carrier when he was young.
As a result he may develop his cooking skills after [wd7,-1] years, also he got guys from his job.
Second a man prefered [fm1,-] to do a job because to which is the most one he (or she ) wanted to devoted themselves; a teacher may had [vp9,1-] the instuctor [fm1,-] as the objective of his life, a policeman regard [vp3,1-] defeating crime as his own duty... all the above are just the second case.
They think it is full of challenge to do the new work well [wd5,s-] , also a larish [fm1,-] experience of one's career offers plenty of knowledge for him.
My view on job-hopping is that the job we engaging [vp4,s-] must fit [vp1,-s] in our interest at first.
Somebody would like to do the same work all ways [wd7,s-] , because he hopes that he will be a specific expert in one field.
According to them, if you focus on your work, you will achive [fm1,-] greatment [fm2,-] .
The other of them [wd5,1-] believe that new job [np6,1-] can enchance [fm1,-] them.
Because I believe that only if have [wd1,-1] I enough acknolagy [fm1,-] , I could access [wd3,1-] in my field.
Therefor [fm1,-] , I will work hard in one field all ways [wd7,s-] , then I can get enough acknology [fm1,-] about my field.
Today, my country is rebuting [fm1,-] , and requires specific expert [np6,3-] , so I have chance to do those [pr1,s-] .
To Job-Hopping, there are defferent [fm1,-] views one from one, I think.
Firstly, he is satisfied with the current job, for its high wages, good conditions as well [wd5,1-] , moreover, it is challenging to him.
The reasons, by contrast, are that the job isn't suitable for him, or he want [vp3,1-] to prove his ability, dispite [fm1,-] the good conditions of the current job.
My view is that if he have [vp3,1-] enough ability and courage, he can change his [wd4,-] certainly [wd3,1-] , but he must think it over in advance, because it is an important thing to him or his family.
In order to life [wd2,3-] , any adult needs to have a job.
There are two views about how to work: The first, some one likes to do only a [wd3,1-1] job all his life.
Because he likes [vp1,-1] live a stability [wd2,-1] life; Because he is highly responsible.
The second, some one likes to work [wd3,1-3] from one job to another frequently.
He also has his reason for [wd5,-2] to do so.
He like [vp3,1-] to live an uncalm [fm2,-] life.
He thinks that doing this kind of job is adventure [wd2,1-] and stimulatous [fm2,-] .
Compared with that [np8,-4] two kinds of men, I'd like to do as the first man, I think that a man should have a spirit of loving his job.
So we should do a job and contribute all our lives for [wd3,s-] it.
Do [vp4,-s] one job gives them more chances to train themselves in technology and skill.
Do [vp4,-s] one job can train us specialist [np3,1-] in this field.
Some people like to have one kinds [np3,1-] of jobs in his [pr3,s-] life.
They may feverite [fm1,-] the job or they have special kill on this job or they can do nothing if they leave the work.
Sometimes they may word as a teacher but when you letter [fm1,-] meet him he maybe [wd5,-1] is a manger [fm1,-] in a company.
They always think the job they used to do is not suit [wd3,s-] for him, or can not express his capacity [cc3,2-] .
So they give up it [wd1,1-] and find a new one.
Because once we find a job it may not [wd4,-2] the best for us.
Only through the change of job may we find the most propriate [fm1,-] job.
Some people like to do the same kind of job from beginning to the [wd5,-1] end.
There are some reasons for this, first, those people who can do a particular job very well always [wd5,2-] feel happy when they do it, second, some people like the lifestyle of some what coincise [fm1,-] , they do not like to make themselves too busy, and do not want to face frustration other jobs bring to them.
Others like to do different jobs, these people are always active, full of energy, and they think do different kinds of jobs can make their life always full of freshness, and so that they enjoy different happyness [fm1,-] .
In my opinion, people should do different kind [np3,1-] of jobs.
Life for us is only once [aj5,s-] , we shouldn't live through it indifferently.
If you do only one job, how do you know what all of [wd5,1-] you can do?
Yet this kind of condition is very few [wd3,1-] .
Different people have different view [np3,1-] on Job-Hopping.
Some people would rather devote himself [pr3,s-] to one job.
If you do many jobs in the limit [wd3,-1] time, you don't do only one job well enough and you are difficult to make progress.
When one has been doing a job for a long time, we [pr3,s-] will [wd4,1-1] tired of it and has [vp3,s-] a low spirit.
If he have [vp3,1-] a new job, his spirit get [vp3,1-] high, and can do the job well easily.
I consider that, one should devote himself into [wd3,2-] one job, and do it well, in order to get the top of the field quickly and make large progresses [cc4,1-] .
But you also must [wd1,1-] know something of other job [np6,1-] .
If your job is lost one day, you could enter other job [cc3,2-] easily.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to take one job for his life.
Such people are almost pushy job- takers [fm2,-] and they like their job very much.
They sometimes dedicate their most [wd5,s-] time to developing their job.
However, some people like to chang [fm1,-] their job frequently.
Such people are almost look [vp9,4-] [vp1,-s] the job less important than the salary.
We not only make money on [wd3,-1] it , but obtain much interest from job [np6,1-] .
We should take job [np6,1-] carefully.
<ST 4> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <AGE ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 1> <WAY 1> <SCH 2745> <TITLE My View on Job-Hopping> <SCORE 9> <ID 440722>Many people are always having the same job for many years even for all their life time, especially of the old man and woman, perhaps it's because they like the steady rythem [fm1,-] such as the regular working time, the working conditions or the steady salary.
On the countrary [fm1,-] some people always the young man chang [fm1,-] their jobs for [pp2,-3] time to time.
The society is in [wd5,s-] developing fast and many chance [np3,1-] we can have, why don't go out the old job for a new challenging one?
But others pefer [fm1,-] to change work some times [wd3,1-] , they all their reason to support their view.
They think they take a same job for long time, they will be familar [fm1,-] with their job.
In a word, they think [vp1,-s] it better to have a kind of stable job.
To the second kind of man, often changing job is alert [wd3,s-] .
Because they have many chances to show their ability [cc3,2-] .
They also think that it is chaningable [fm1,-] to take all kinds of job.
They are going to adventure [wd2,s-] .
Everthing [fm1,-] has two sides.
Because our society needs sythenic [fm2,-] ability man [wd3,2-] , we should study hard in order to adapt [vp1,-s] to the development of economition [fm1,-] .
In general, people can be seprated [fm1,-] into two groups.
One group like [vp3,1-] to do one job forever.
Because they think [vp1,-1] it possible for them to become experts in the field they are working in, and they can make good freids [fm1,-] with others.
But another group want [vp3,1-] to change their jobs frenquently [fm1,-] .
To [pp2,-2] my view, I like the first group.
China has a says [wd3,1-] " When doing a job, then love it".
Because people have limited energy, you [pr1,s-] should focus on one thing then you may succeed.
If you do many jobs in [wd4,1-2] short time, you will never succeed.
We know the number of types of job [np3,2-] is very large.
different [fm3,-] man does different job.
People's views on job-Hopping is [vp3,4-] not [wd4,1-1] same.
they [fm3,-] will do well in the jobs.
They acquaint [vp1,-s] them and have some skills.
If they turn to do other jobs, they have no experience in doing well [wd1,-1] them, they don't understand them, they will not feel favourable [wd3,s-] .
But some people like to turn to do other jobs, they enjoy challenging themselves, they will gain different joy from a new job, they possiblely [fm1,-] work better in the new position.
So I think I will not turn to other job [np3,1-] when I find a good one, but, if the job is not suitable to me.
Many people like to going [vp5,1-] in for a job because they like stationary life and do not want to change the environment they were [vp6,-s] living.
Also they interest [vp1,-s] in this job.
Another reason is maybe [wd5,s-] they aren't satisfactory [wd3,1-1] of their salaries, their working conditions or other factor [np3,6-] .
Before hunting a job you should make certain [wd3,1-] your special field and your interest, they are both important.
From our childhood we began [vp1,-1] on studying.
You should see to [vp1,-s] your selection and then learning in your filed.
Your learning may be infuluenced [fm1,-] by your interest.
After this, you should consider many factors to [wd3,1-3] your job hunting, then decide to select one job for you.
But one job you selected is often not be [wd5,s-] the best for you, you should put your heart into it to make the job best.
All the job you want don't [vp3,s-] [vp9,s-] always be the one you wanted.
The period [wd3,1-] is changing very fast you should insist on [wd3,1-] learning .
Learn [vp4,-s] from books, from the people surrounding you, this will benefit you, so I like to work in [wd3,-2] my interest and be stationary.
Everyone has his view on varies [fm1,-] job-hopping.
Somebody like [vp3,1-] taking one job all along.
These people love quiet, stable [wd4,2-] , and they don't want to go anywhere.
Other people often change their job, because they like chanllege [fm1,-] .
They want to overcome difficulty [np6,1-] and want to defeat [wd3,1-1] themselves.
I belong to the second sort as [wd3,s-] we [pr3,s-] mentioned in the last paragraph.
In [wd4,1-1] present society, anybody who is a man would not live without money.
I have many dreams, but I also have to take [wd3,1-2] the society.
I love work and I like chanllege [fm1,-] .
If one job can verify one's value [cc3,2-] , I would chose this job.
We would face very many diffculties [fm1,-] when we change our works [wd3,s-] .
But we can't give up, or you are failurer [fm2,-] .
We may adjust ourselves to adoput [fm1,-] the new enviroment [fm1,-] .
We woke [fm1,-] hard or we study hard, which is good to us.
Though society is complex, we live with oneself [wd3,3-] , for oneself, and we can defeat oneself, at last we think the society is so simple.
There are some people who like going in for a job from begaining [fm1,-] to end.
They think changing of jobs will let them not [wd1,2-] work efficiently.
During the young time [cc4,1-] , they learned a [wd5,-2] specialized knowledge.
When they went into society, this [pr1,s-] entitled them the ability to work.
But some people think that it is no [wd3,s-] interesting for them to work only in [wd3,-2] one job.
They more [wd1,-s] like changing work from time to time, only in this way, work can be interesting.
During the colledge [fm1,-] time, [cc1,1-] they learned a lot of knowledge, not focused in one side , and they didn't like the specialize knowledge they learned in college.
In my oppion [fm1,-] , I will go in for a job through my life, but I will still go in for a lot of amateur job, this will make me live more comfortable [wd2,s-] and suceed [fm1,-] in working for the people.
because [fm3,-] we can do the job fast without any thinking.
above [fm3,-] all it is helpful for improving technolog [fm1,-] .But some people like [vp1,-1] change job [np6,1-] often .Because he want [vp3,1-] to find a better job(He like [vp3,1-] the job and the job is fitted [wd3,1-] for him.
) some people like [vp1,-1] change job [np6,1-] because he want [vp3,1-] to master many kinds of technolog [fm1,-] .
Because we change job [np6,1-] often, people will think we can't do well [wd1,-1] everything.
We can't get well with on [vp2,3-] the people aroud [fm1,-] us.
But when we need [vp1,-1] change a job insure [wd3,s-] we should change it with a lot of thinking.
Everyone has its [pr1,2-] own view on everything, and also on job-hopping.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to do a [np7,-1] same job as possible as he could.
Because, to him, the familiar circumbrance [fm1,-] , the old friends and the pleasure of his family are the most important.
But there is another kind of person who like [vp1,-1] change jobs at times.
He likes new conditions, new faces and even new challengments [fm2,-] .
I like to do the same entertainments [fm2,-] with same old friends and go to a same bar to have a drink.
They like new things and like taking adventure [cc3,1-] .
They will find varity [fm1,-] of pleasure from different jobs.
I want [vp1,-1] find pleasure from many ways.
In our society if one man want [vp3,2-] to live or live better, he must have a job to do.
Only throug [fm1,-] working he can [wd1,1-] get money to buy what he need [vp3,1-] .
First, doing the same job, special skill [np6,1-] needed is constant [wd3,s-] , they don't have to learn other skills.
But some people like to change their jobs, just because they think that doing variable [wd3,-1] jobs can exercise their ability and choosing good jobs also can enable them to get much money.
In my vives [fm1,-] , I support the former, every one energy is limited.
We want to contribut [fm1,-] to the society and we can do a job well, which is the best way.
In our large county [fm1,-] , if many people change their job, continally [fm1,-] the society problems will occure [fm1,-] .
For our [wd3,1-2] college students, since we have choose [vp9,1-] the professionl [fm1,-] field, we had better engage in the specialize [wd2,-] and do it well as possible as we can in the future.
In short, I appreciate the people who divide [wd3,-2] his life to a job.
Every [np3,s-] people have a different working ways [np3,3-] .
Some are content to go in for a job for lifes [fm2,-] .
Because they expect to assure the stability of his position and salary, which is considered as a common sense.Some are inclined to shift job [np6,1-] continously [fm1,-] .
Because they always seek [vp1,-1] for a [np7,1-1] ideal condition, which can provide him more chances to exert their abilities.
On [pp1,-2] my view, a variety of working ways is not most important for every people [np3,1-] , the importance is if we can dedicate our knowledges [fm2,-] to the society and promote human being's progress [cc3,3-] .
As a result, I think that Job-Hopping is only a kind of form of sevicing [fm1,-] for society.
Some of the people would devote themselves to one unchungable [fm1,-] job, the reason perhaps is that the job is their own aim and they like and want to go in for it with their all lives.
About this question, my view on job-hopping may be the following three points: The first one, you should get a job you like or be [wd3,s-] interested in, then you work for it with your soul and heart, for one person should do some things for society more or less.
In your job, you must practice and achieve [vp1,2-] .
If we don't make much good [cc3,2-] , but change jobs, I think it is no good for yourself [wd3,1-] and any people.
Some people like only one kind of job all his life, because they think since he [pr3,-] find [vp3,1-] a favorate [fm1,-] job, he should not change it.
They don't like always changeing [fm2,-] works [wd3,1-] .
There are too many terribles [fm2,-] , they think.
Generally speaking, the characteristics of this kind is single and inter-type [fm2,-] .
On the other hand, there are [vp3,1-1] another group of people, who like various work.
They like changeing [fm1,-] jobs in order to try [vp1,-1] on various of jobs in the world.
And this kind of men is very lively and outer-type [fm2,-] .
Because I'm an outer-type [fm2,-] person, changing work sometimes to improve myself is my choice.
Some people like doing a [np7,-1] same job all life, but [wd3,s-] some people like changing their jobs often.
The two kinds of people both have their [wd4,s-] ---The first kind like [vp3,1-] their jobs very much, and they want to do something in their field.
For example, a person who likes music is doing music work, he like [vp3,1-] the music too much to change his job, and he will do this job all life.
Or some people want to change the enviorment [fm1,-] and find a good job.
So they change their jobs obstantly [fm1,-] .
My view on job-hopping is: When you like your job, you should do it hard; but when you don't like your job, you can change a job that meet [wd3,-1] you.
With the development of society, people's attituds [fm1,-] to jobs are changing greatly.
The reasons for this are that they love their job very much or they might think they are familar [fm1,-] with the job and have enough experiences for the job.
Even if they are somewhat unsuitable to it, they convince [vp1,-s] that they will do it well soon.
By changing, they will gain interests, and work in a comfortable envirement [fm1,-] .
Some of them also change their jobs for income or relationship when their income is not enough to meet the requirement of their family, they have to find a new job when they don't get along well with their workmates [fm2,-] or leaders, they also need to get a new job.
In my opnion [fm1,-] , people may take part time jobs according to their interests.
By doing so, their life will be more happly [fm1,-] .
Those who like doing the only job that they devote [vp1,-1] to think that the job is an important part of their lives.
They are always conservational [fm2,-1] people.
They hate job-hopping because they think the job-hoppings can't do [cc3,-2] their works carefully and hardly [wd2,-] .
But the job-hoppings regard that job-hopping make their lives more vivid, and they get more experiences when they have done so many works [wd3,s-] .
To [pp2,-2] my opinion, I prefer devoting myself to one job.
But if I devote [vp1,-1] to one job, I can manage to make my life.
They change them [pr1,s-] in order to learn something new and learn new abilities [cc3,2-] .
Some ones [np6,-s] likes to do a [wd3,-3] kind of job all throng [wd3,s-] his [pr3,s-] life.
They think that the job is good and they are familiar [aj2,1-1] in it .They have the good ways.
The importainest [fm1,-] is they don't like change [np6,1-] .
Some ones [np6,1-2] likes to change their job usually.
They will learn to adopt many different job [np3,2-] and get well along with many different people.
And they think that often change [vp4,s-] job [np6,1-] will let them study more, and also can improve theirs [wd3,-1] capities [fm1,-] .
My view on Job-Hopping [fm3,-] is that I will do the job that I am interest [vp5,1-1] in.
The interest is most importanest [fm1,-] [aj3,1-] .
I also like [vp1,2-2] change job [np6,1-] , it have [vp3,1-] challenge.
It can make my experiementes [fm1,-] become abound.
Maybe, I will do a kind of job or change main [wd3,-1] job, but I will do my best!
Some people want to go in for one work for good, because they fell [fm1,-] that man must do it [pr1,s-] and like it.
Furthermore, they maybe [wd3,-s] decline [vp1,-s] to live a standing life [cc4,1-] and avoid the unfamilar [fm1,-] fields.
On the other hand, some people like often [wd1,-3] change their work.
Firstly, they can touch [vp1,-s] in all kinds of new things, and they can come along with [wd3,2-] lots of people.
Secondly, their charator [fm1,-] of activity decide [vp3,s-] [wd3,s-] they can't take in [wd3,1-] one work otherwise, they feel poor.
On [pp2,-2] my opinion, one person do [vp3,1-] one work good [wd2,s-] or often change [vp3,s-] it, he consider [vp3,1-] his need corrdingly [fm1,-] , we can't say two habits which is right or which is better.
When individual person [np6,1-] feel [vp3,1-] his life is right, they [pr3,s-] will have a good time.
Because, it can insure stable living resource [cc4,1-] .
One can improve owner [wd3,s-] technolgy [fm1,-] in the field of the job.
By studying the knowledge of the job, one's ability become [vp3,1-] more skilled.
 [cc2,s-] This efficiency will enhence [fm1,-] .
Firstly once they find the job is not suitable for him [pr3,s-] , they will want to change the job.
Secondly, they think that changing job is a challege [fm1,-] for them.
I will go in for it for ever and fit [vp1,-2] for it.
But how can we should [vp9,2-] do.
Some one like [vp3,1-] to do one job for a [wd5,1-1] long.
Because they think that can make [vp1,-3] to gain achievements.
Some one like [vp3,1-] to change their jobs frequently.
Because this makes them find a job that fit [vp3,3-] [vp1,-1] for them at last.
Because the job is [vp9,-1] fit for us or not is concerned to our success.
If we are at a work that we do not like, we will be not interested in it and can not do it good [wd2,s-] .
So when we find the job do [vp3,1-] not fit [vp1,-1] for us, we must try another one.
Some people may like to change his [pr3,s-] job.
Changing job may give them many chance [np3,1-] to study more knowledge [cc3,2-] and accumulate much [np8,-1] experiences.
My write [wd3,1-2] on job-hopping is that whether changing job [np6,1-] is not important.
Only if I like job [np6,1-] , and the job may give me much enjoyment.
I hope [vp1,-1] got a job which is suitable what I have read.
Some people like to work the same job [cc3,3-] for ever.
Because they feel if they change the jobs frequently, they will no [wd3,1-] succeed any job.
I think these two kinds of attitudes all [wd3,s-] have their benefits.
When I am young, before I find the job I like best, I can do many kinds of jobs, training myself ,and get difference [wd2,-1] kinds of abilities.
But when I find the job I'm favor to, I will devote myself into [wd3,2-] it, will succeed soon.
Some people like to do a job in his [pr3,s-] life.
Some people like to change their job, because they read [wd3,-3] a better job or they don't like to do a job in a long time.
I like to do a job in my life, because I think a job contains many things, such as knowledge and mind [wd3,s-] .
In order to do the best, I will do a job all in [wd5,1-2] my life.
On the other hand, someone else insist [vp3,2-] on [wd3,1-] alternative [wd3,-1] work that they prefer to [vp1,s-] .
Because they are looking forward to better life [np6,1-] , rather than the single life.
In a word, they'd like to risk something that they didn't [vp6,-s] experience.In my opinion, I'd like to pursuit [wd2,s-] a single work.
I believe I can achieve [vp1,-s] after with my confidence all along.
They can get much [np8,-1] experiences to [wd3,-2] these jobs.
So they can master much [np8,-1] skills.
Some people like to change their jobs because they like to advent [fm2,-] .
They like to live a splendid life.In my opinion, I like to change my job frequently because I want to get much experiences [np8,1-] to [wd3,-3] all kinds of job [np3,3-] and master much [np8,-1] skills.
Some bodys [fm1,-] like to do a work in a long time, because they do not like to face new challenge.Some bodys [fm1,-] like to change jobs, because they like to face new adventure.
In my mind, I will work in [wd3,-2] a job for a long time ever all my life, if I like it.
If I work in [wd3,-2] a job that I do not like, then I will intend to change, until I get the job which like.
Some of the rest people like to change work frequently, because they have variable [wd3,-1] interests and they will try their best to find which one can bring them complete success.
Between two of the front [wd3,1-] , I agree with the first.
I have only one purpose-being a boss who have [vp3,3-] a famous firm.
This aim isn't [vp9,-1] change ever since my boyhood.
Some people like to go on the same work in their lives, they say only the same work, you can learn more knowledge, and you would do your best, because work need [vp3,1-] the long time to study, while you have short time.
You can't do scientists [cc3,1-] .
If they didn't [vp9,-s] spent the long time ,ever their lives, they couldn't do anything in science.
But some people don't agree with [wd3,1-2] the opinion, they like to change their work.
Some work need [vp3,2-] long time to do.
But to [wd3,-1] work people have many various [wd5,1-1] different views.
They are customed [fm1,-] to [pp1,3-3] do the same thing once and they are not fit for the variety of work.However some like to change work constantly.
To me, my view on job-hopping is what job could fit me to do, and my abates [fm1,-] is enough to do it good [wd2,s-] .
I will enjoy taking it.Fits [wd3,-s] is the most important things on one's job-hopping.
Some people prefer [vp1,2-4] to doing a kind of job from start to end, because they like the stable surrounding, that is to say, day by day more experience can be got.Others may prefer [vp1,2-4] to changing jobs frequently.
They have passion, hearty [wd3,1-] and barrette.
They prefer [vp1,1-5] to fresh things rather than old ones.
So changing jobs can give them a challenge to meet.My opinion is that do [vp4,-s] what I'm interested in.
If you don't like to do or have no interests [wd3,s-] , you may not have impulse to do it.
That is why many employer [np3,1-] may ask employ [wd3,s-] such [wd5,-2] the same question-what do you like to do?
Someone likes [vp1,-1] do [wd4,1-1] same job all his life.
Because he thinks that the same job of long-period [fm2,-] will make him more skilled than others.
He thinks that the same kind of work limit [vp3,s-] his that thought and emanation [fm1,-] , but different jobs will give him different knowledge and they will help him do better than others.
Some people like [vp1,-1] do a [np7,-2] same job from start to the end.
They can enjoy the success from doing the same work better and better.While some others often like [vp1,-1] change the job.
Because they want to touch [vp1,-s] with the new thing and new people.
This make [vp3,1-] their life more well [wd2,s-] .My view on job-hopping is do the same job.
I can get more successfully [wd2,s-] .
After all, a man's capital [fm1,-] is limit [vp9,1-] , I can not study all the skills very well.
Somebody always like [vp3,2-] to do a kind of work because they think that the work is best.
The work make [vp3,1-] them happy.
So they always do it.Some body like [vp3,1-] job-hopping.
After they always do the same work, they fell [fm1,-] that the work is boring.
The work is [vp9,-2] not suit for them.
My view on job-hopping is that I do what I like.If a kind of work make [vp3,s-] me unhappy or make [vp3,s-] me feel boring [aj4,1-] , I will give it up.
I will to [vp9,1-] find what I like.
I don't have much chance of choice [wd2,1-] work.
Some people like [vp1,-s] work on a job seat [wd3,1-] .
They don't like [vp1,-s] change work environment.
There are [wd4,1-2] same people work [vp5,s-] with them, so they can help each other.
Then the work can finish [vp7,2-] queenly [fm1,-] .
Every a [wd5,1-] new job can bring him new friends.
They must to [vp9,1-] suit [vp1,-s] for the new work so they have to learn new skill [np6,1-] .
Some people change work because they want [vp1,-1] have more money or have higher job seat [wd3,1-] .
To do a work best is not easy, we must spend many [np8,-1] time to do it.
Change a job, we will begin a new objection [wd3,s-] .
Change so many work is not good for us do thing [np6,1-] well.
Some people like [vp1,-s] do a [np7,-1] same job for long time.
So they don't spend much time in studding [fm1,-] how to work well.
So they don't adjust himself [pr3,s-] to go on with a new job.
I think they like a smooth life.Some people like to change their job with him [pr3,s-] .
If they find that the job isn't fitted [vp7,2-] with him [pr3,s-] , they'll change to other job quickly.
Because they want to find a job which is fitted [vp7,2-] himself mostly.
So they can showed [vp9,1-] their ability.
They like to have new thing [np6,1-] in the job every day, don't like the same thing in the job.
I can do a job in less [wd4,1-2] ten years.
After several years I'll have a bass [fm1,-] in my job.I think I'll change my job less [wd4,1-2] ten times in my [wd1,-1] all life.
Someone like [vp3,1-] doing one job and never change because they want a still life.
They don't like [vp1,-s] go here or there from time to time or they are afraid of new living situation.
This kind of men don't seem to succeed.Other [np6,-s] like often changing their jobs because they don't like a life never changing.
They want to see new things and different felling [fm1,-] .
My view on job-hopping is that seize every opptunity [fm1,-] you can if you want to succeed.
If you change job [np6,1-] only for your pressure, you will never succeed, and come down to the world.
And don't container [wd3,-2] your job if there's other good job waiting for you.
You maybe [wd3,-s] lose a chance to come up to the world for your newer changing.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to going [vp1,3-2] in for a kind of work only because they are most interesting [aj4,-1] in it, they are tired of [pp1,2-2] change a job frequently.
They are used to do [vp5,3-] his favorite job and enjoy it.Someone like [vp3,1-] to changing [vp1,3-2] his job frequently because his hobby is wide [cc4,2-] , and he like [vp3,1-] to receive [wd3,-2] new things and enjoy it, this help [vp3,1-] him to improve his experience and skill.
I think I belong to the behead [wd3,1-] one.
That they know better about the job will make their [pr4,1-] succeed in their work.
They can use the knowledge they just learned from a job into [wd3,-3] the next job.
I though [fm1,-] any job needed a diligent person.
The issue of employment has always been the concerning focus of the wholl [fm1,-] society.
The time is going on and people's view on job-hopping are [vp3,s-] changing too.
In Easten [fm1,-] World, such as China, Japan, most people hold this opinion.
These people aren't pleasant [wd3,s-] to change.
All they want or persuit [fm1,-] is a stable and peace [wd2,-1] life.
So they do a job only to earn money to leave [wd3,-1] on, even they don't interested [vp9,1-] in what they're doing.
Unlike the people above-mentioned [fm2,-] , some persons change their job constently [fm1,-] .
They more persuit [fm1,-] stimulativity [fm2,-] .
Besides they hope their job to be chanllegable [fm1,-] , so that they can show their capacity [wd3,2-] adequately.
In my opionion [fm1,-] , people have free right to chose [vp5,4-2] a job.
In keen [wd3,-1] competitive society, people should think more about survival.
So I think, the correct attitude to chose [vp5,2-1] job [np6,1-] is that: everyone must select [wd3,-2] one position that he or she is interested in and compatable [fm1,-] to.
Someone only like [vp3,2-] a kind of work, because they think with the time passing.
they can get more and more experiments [wd3,s-] .
Another reason is maybe [wd5,s-] they like [vp1,-s] live clam [wd7,2-] .
But someone like [vp3,1-] [vp1,-s] change their job very frequently, because they think the more work they even had [vp6,-s] , the more chance [np3,1-] they can catch.
But I think one should apply for a work is relation to what he studyed [fm2,-] in school, so he can do it better.
If his work has nothing with he studied in school, he has to spend much time studying new knowledge [cc3,2-] .
Someone like [vp3,1-] doing the same job in his life.
First, somebody's job is [vp9,-2] very fit for him.
The job can make him use his ability enough, he feel [vp3,1-] very happy.
They fear [vp1,-s] of facing different enviomences [fm1,-] and people.
But other people often like changing job [np6,1-] .
They think changing job [np6,1-] brings them chances, they can learn many things from changing job [np6,1-] , such as knowledges [fm2,-] , the ability of living, the attitude of living, the relationship of people.
So I like changing job [np6,1-] .
They only want to do a [np7,-2] same job in their lives.
They think that the time and the energy are limited, so they can't have enough time and energy to changing [vp5,6-] job [np6,1-] .
At the same time, they think it is trouble to change a job, because they must learn new knowledge and adapt new work conditions.But some like to changing [vp1,4-1] jobs.
There are some reason [np3,3-] .
Firstly, some think it can practice their capacity; secondly, it affort [fm1,-] a chance to study new knowledge and broad [wd2,-2] their eyesight's [fm1,-] .
thirdly [fm3,-] , it is a opportunity to compete.
I think it is benefit [wd2,s-] to change jobs.
Some people like to contribute all their life to [wd4,1-2] same job.
But others rather than change their works [wd3,1-] more often.
In fact, people have different attitudes towards the job because they live in different environment [np6,1-] or they have different view on life.The people that like to contribute all their life to [wd4,1-2] same job may be very interested in [wd4,1-2] some job, or are forced by parents [np6,1-] , friends..., even or have no confidence to join in other work.
That people [np3,1-] who more like to change job [np6,1-] maybe [wd3,s-] feel the job no chanleging [fm1,-] ,or they think that to do different job is enjoyment, and so on.
I think that we should do according by [wd5,s-] ourselves.
There is a debate on job-hopping, some people say it is good for one to do [wd4,1-2] same job, others say it is good for one to do the various kinds of jobs.
People who say it is good to do the same job think the same job gives them steady wages, practices their basic background skills, makes them live more comfortable [wd2,s-] .People who say it is good to do the various kinds of jobs have another view.
They think various jobs give them intensions [fm1,-] , adjust them to society, give them changledgings [fm1,-] .As a undergraduate, my view on job-hopping is using what I have studied in the university for the benefits of people.
In my spare time, I do another job that is relative [wd3,1-] to my subject to make much progress of my social abilities, to do my best for the benefit of country [np6,1-] .
Some people seems [vp3,1-] more like a single job than a [np7,-1] alternative job in his whole life.
They think that a single job can make them more skillful on it, while alternative job [np6,1-] need [vp1,-s] them always learn new knowledge [cc3,2-] .
But some people like alternative job [np6,1-] rather than a single job, they think that alternative job [np6,1-] can make their knowledge more comprehensive, while a single job restrict them on a single life.
To [pp2,-2] my opion [fm1,-] about job-hopping, I think that if everyone can find a job which fit [vp3,s-] him and he also like [vp3,1-] it, he needn't always want to alternate [wd3,s-] it just because other people do.
But if the job isn't fit [vp9,1-1] for him, he should took [vp9,1-] [vp1,-1] for another job which is fit [vp9,1-1] for him .
Many people likes [vp3,2-] to engage in a kind of job all along [wd5,1-2] the time.
Because they think a fixed job can bring them a stable position and a skilled work procedure [cc4,2-] .
If a job was often changed, they would try to fit [vp9,1-1] in it every time, and this will expend [wd3,-s] them much time and energy.
But other people likes [vp3,1-] to change the job oftenly [fm2,-] .
Because they think different job can bring them different feeling, if they have a new job, it will make him a new position, the other side [pp2,2-] , a fixed job is no taste, it would make man a bad behavior, lose the interesting [wd3,1-3] of the living.
I think, a man can't change the job time and time [wd7,2-] but also can't fix [wd3,s-] on a job from time to time if you [pr1,s-] think it is unfit [vp9,1-] for you.
Because you can't maste [fm1,-] the skill about your work is a short time, if you change the job oftenly [fm2,-] , you will have nothing on [wd3,-2] you living.
But, if you have lose [vp9,1-] interested [wd3,1-] in a job you have taken a long time, still you can't put your heart on it, if you want to make a great progress in your remained [wd3,-1] living, you'd better change a job, in ordor [fm1,-] to exposed your skill [cc3,2-] enough and make a great achievement in your job, so the job can't be changed oftenly [fm2,-] , but if you find it not fit for you, you must change it as soon as possible.
Their [wd3,-5] are two kinds of man [np3,3-] .
One kind tend [vp3,2-] to do only one kind of work for long time.
Because they interested on [aj2,1-] this work very much.
Or they think they had [vp6,-s] do [vp9,1-] the work very skill [wd2,s-] , and not tend to change their work.The other tend [vp3,1-] to often change their work.
Because they think the work they doing [vp4,1-] soon become [vp3,s-] uninterested [aj4,-1] , the new work can give them new interesting [wd3,s-] .
Or they love the challendge [fm1,-] of new work.
I think, pay [vp4,-s] close attention to one work is a food banner, because it can make us do this work more and more effciencely [fm1,-] and improve the productive [wd2,s-] .
New work can give us new challendge [fm1,-] .
In a word, working hard, facing the challendge [fm1,-] .
Because they like to meet with new challenges and opportunities.In new work [np6,1-] , they find themselves have new opportunities again.
In my opinion, we can change our work because we must do those [np8,-1] work that we can interest [vp7,2-] in .
But our life are [vp3,1-] limited, we can't always return to [wd4,1-1] starting-point.
Some people like to do a [wd3,-1] job all time.
For one thing, they think that that job fits [vp1,-1] to them and they can do somethings [fm2,-] in that job.
For another, they are afraid [aj2,-1] to challenges, they fear [vp1,-1] to find a new job, like to do a job with good paid [wd3,1-] .
But some people like to do all kinds of jobs usually [wd3,s-] .
They change their jobs because they like to [wd5,1-1] challenges, they want to turn out their abilities, they can keep up with the times.
In order to gain a better paid [wd3,1-] , they prefer to a new job.
I think that people should change their job when their abilities aren't be [wd5,1-] used or the boss dislike [vp3,1-] them.
But when the jobs are [vp9,-1] fit to them, they can achieve sucess [fm1,-] in their jobs, they should stay and do their jobs better.
It is said that someone hope [vp3,1-] their jobs all along not changing.
They think that they can make focus [cc3,1-] on the Job [fm3,-] and do the job better.
They can have expericement [fm1,-] on the similar Jobs [fm3,-] .
Someone think [vp3,1-] they would like [vp1,-1] change job [np6,1-] all the way.
They say they must find a job that fit [vp9,1-2] in for them.
And they think they can have all kinds of expericements [fm1,-] through finding job [np6,1-] .
My view on job-hopping is that if I find a job fitting for [wd5,1-] me, then I will not change the Job [fm3,-] again.
I must make focus [cc3,1-] on the job, and do some achievement [cc3,2-] .
If the job is unfit [vp9,1-] for me, I wouldn't stop [vp1,-1] find job until the job is fit [vp9,1-1] for me.
Every people [np3,1-] has his or her own view on job-hopping.
Some people who intend to take only [wd4,-1] kind of job in their whole life are in the view of the stable job can offer them stable life and the chances of being promoted.
They maybe [wd5,-s] also think that just engaging [vp7,2-] in one kind of job can let them fit for the job more perfectly.
But my view on job-hoping is diffent [fm1,-] from the above.
If one that doesn't like his own job or the is not suitable for him, he still work [vp3,1-] in the stable position, just for the promotion by his experience.
But if one in order to find a suitable job changes his job frequently, he will faild [fm1,-] sometimes.
According to my view on job-hopping, if one take [vp3,1-] no insteresting [fm1,-] in his present job or isn't suitable for his present job can change his job.
In real life, some people like to engage in a [np7,-1] same job all the way.
After enter [vp5,1-] into a career which they like and have ability to do it quite well.
So they don't want to change another job, which causes they study the others from the begining [fm2,-] .
These people often like adventure and chanllage [fm1,-] .
They think changing job [np6,1-] will help them to acquire much more knowledge and ability which they can cope with more practical problems in the real life.
For example, their present job is lower [wd3,-1] paid or their bosses are too hard to get along with.
As I think ,both thinkings [fm1,-] have their right reasons [cc4,1-] .
I'm a student of [wd4,1-4] department of computer science.
Also, I think I'm quite suit [vp9,2-] for doing computer work.
then [fm3,-] we can be succeed [wd2,-] .
We can't change it [pr1,s-] .
For example, once there lived a farmer, he was worried [aj1,2-3] to see that the crops were very small, then he pulled the crops from the land.
The story tell [vp3,1-] us, that "One step could not go to sky".
We must try our bests [vp2,2-1] to do everything and obey the natural orders, obey the things' orders.
One day, we will be succeeded [wd3,s-] .
The reason of "haste makes waste" [np1,-] is that only hard work lead [vp3,1-] to success and to complete a hard work needs a long time.
Certainly you couldn't turn your dream into practice [wd3,3-] in one night.
You must learn Arithmetic [wd3,1-] , Chinese, physics and other basic course [np3,2-] in your primary school, and high school.
Then after years of above mentioned knowledge's study you will learn how to make a student learn fastly [fm2,-] and well in the Normal university.
Then after your [wd2,1-1] graduated [vp6,-s] from the Normal university, you really become a teacher.
You will see how it is to reach a goal, to catch a success [cc3,2-] .
Contrastly [fm2,-] , if you raise a purpose [cc3,2-] today to be teacher, and you want to teach in the classroom tomorrow.
So they want [vp1,-1] do very fast.
When they remind [wd3,s-] , they have to do it again.
So they finish it more later [aj3,1-] than normal or finish it imperfectly.
When you reach the station, you find [vp1,-s] leave off the ticket on the table.
But inversly [fm1,-] , you miss the train.
As we know,"Haste makes waste" [np1,-] refers simply to the faster one does, the fewer one gets, why ?
If we breach [wd3,s-] it, the natural law will punish us.
Finally, we aren't not [wd5,1-] only advance a step, but also back a step.
For example, the wheat grows too slow, it must grow by using of [wd5,1-] necessary water, sunshine, soil.
If one want [vp3,1-] it to grow faster and pull it higher, the wheat will dead due to loss enough water, soil.
It [pr1,-s] is also right in economic field.
In 1956, [wd4,-3] Chinese government want [vp3,1-] to make more iron, and take all steal of whole country to product [wd2,s-] the iron.
It result [vp3,1-] in the consequence that producted [fm1,-] iron was almost substandard product, in the meantime, the steal was also used up.
The thing wastes plenty of labor, finicial [fm1,-] and raw material, and bring about our economic ability is latter than other countries of the world for many decade years.
Only we have the necessary conditions, we maybe [wd5,s-] get a success.
Or our efforts will waste [vp7,2-] .
He draged [fm1,-] them higher than before.
Doing things too hurry will make you careless, ever [fm1,-] make things be done worse.
But we shall have chart [wd3,-2] for study and go over the lesson everyday.
We can't only want to study quickly, forget interview [wd3,-2] all lesson.
Because everything has it's own develop [wd2,-1] stage.
If you only do things fast but neglect [vp1,-1] to really understand it, it is no use.
"Haste Makes Waste" [np1,-] tell us that we shall do everything carefully.
If some thing in it [wd5,1-] is failure, we would have to do it again.
So we can say "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
" For example, as a student we [pr3,s-] often want to read a book in a short time.
In order to read it [pr3,s-] fast, we read each passage quickly and can't understand what it means.
Second we also should persist to [wd3,1-1] it, struggle for it until obtain it.
In a sense, efforts is [vp3,1-] the first of all factors.
For a [wd5,1-1] example, a boxer before his success he must practice much and suffer from a great deal of blow that few people can endure.
The efforts that he did is waste [wd7,s-] .
Once a man want [vp3,1-] to succeed through the way of rapid speed, he will not realize his dream.
What you can't think of is if you spend less time in working or studying, moreover [wd3,s-] , you can't think over the problems relevant to the work, you will not get at your purpose.
So we can say Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
You can't realize your idea [cc3,2-] .
"Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ", it's means [vp9,1-] if we want to reach our point we expected.
The more faster [ad3,1-] we want, the more difficult that [wd5,s-] we get it .
But at the same time we can do [vp1,-1] with the things confidently and carefully.
We can't predict the difficulties that we will face to [wd5,1-] and have not a good ready.
Then when the difficulties came [vp6,-s] to us, we usually can't comfit [wd3,-1] it well.
Someone want [vp3,1-] to be a running champion.
But he hasn't analysis [wd2,1-] his own conditions and can't have a long-time running every morning and attend the race of the running.
The result must be the defeating [wd3,s-] .
So as we do somethings [fm2,-] , We must avoid "Haste Makes Waste" .
 [np1,-] We should try our best for our own proposal [wd3,s-] .
For instance, the students who take part in the Band Six Contest [wd3,2-] should study English every day, learn more new words by heart, doing [vp5,-s] much reading, little by little, their listening and reading comprehension will be made great progress doing like this.
However if he often doesn't study English carefully, He [fm3,-] will fail to pass it.
Step by step, thus we can succeed, or it [pr1,s-] can only lead to "Haste [fm3,-] makes wastes".
 [np1,-] <ST 4> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <AGE ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 1> <WAY 1> <TITLE Haste Makes Waste> <SCH 2207> <SCORE 7> <ID 430409>
Most people usually like [vp1,-1] haste when they doing something.
But this will result in an opposite end [wd3,2-] .
You are necessary to remember: ?Haste [fm3,-] Make [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] !?
Haste reflects the strong will of our desire to success [wd2,s-] .
First it often make [vp3,1-] us overestimate ourselves.
We will feel dispressed [fm1,-] when we don't carry out it.
Second, it also make [vp3,2-] us daydream.
Because of it [pr1,s-] we can't concentrate on our work.
We all know that ?Haste [fm3,-] make waste".
At [pp2,-2] [wd4,1-2] first week he complied with the plan.
But a week passed, he told me that he still did not pass the English text [wd3,3-] and he gave it up.
The English study need [vp3,s-] a lot of time.
This is the "Haste [fm3,-] make waste".
 [np1,-] 
What is "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] "?
 [np1,-] It implies that if one wants to do something more quickly, he may get the inverse [wd3,-1] consequence.
This will lead to your behaviour in unconsistence [fm1,-] .
So it is natural that you can't obtain your expective [fm2,-] result.
In our lives, it [pr1,-s] is common.
He could get to [wd5,1-1] there on foot.
But in order to save time, he drived [fm2,-] his car.
Unfortunately in [pp2,-2] the way to the supermarket, there was a choke [wd3,s-] .
 [np1,-] Why "haste makes waste"?
 [np1,-] That usually because when we do something hurriedly, we often can't make our mind conscious completely.
There are [vp3,-5] not a very clear thought of doing something former [wd3,s-] or later, and the things get mass.
For example, as we often met [vp6,-s] in life, one day you get up too late, there was [vp3,1-3] only three minutes left for you to go to school.
Sometimes, it led [vp6,-s] the thing we want to do more badly.
For example, you drive your car fastly [fm2,-] in order not to be late for work.
In the road, suddenly, a litter [fm1,-] boy run [vp3,1-] across the street, but you are late, the car struck down the boy.
You not only are late for work, but also led [wd3,-2] a [np7,-1] accident.So haste usually makes waste.
I agree [vp1,-1] it, every thing has its own stages [wd3,s-] and procedures, it is objective and can't be freely changed by us.
If we only attend [wd3,-2] the speed, we might omit [wd3,-2] many details or we might be careless, all these may lead to failing [wd3,1-] doing the things.
Later, my teacher told me, before you did it, you'd better go over the notes and the examples, after you had understand [vp9,1-] it.
People often say?Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ?.
If we do the thing very fast, we'll fail on [wd3,-1] it.
If we firstly study speaking, writing, listening and reading, we'll felt [vp9,1-] very difficult.
Lastly, We'll lose [vp9,1-] intersted [fm1,-] in English.
A lot of things [wd4,-1] like this.
?Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ?.
If you want to do things successfully, you must remember "Haste [fm3,-] makes Waste [fm3,-] ".
It telles [fm1,-] us we shouldn't pay attention to the speed of a process alone.
In 1958 the authorities called on the people all over the town [wd3,s-] to work hard to accelerate the speed of national economy.
So many people throughout the country began to meld [fm1,-] iron to improve the product of steel in very poor situation that the steel melt is of no use.
We usually say?Haste [fm3,-] makes waste?.
We can say many examples [cc3,2-] around us: We'll have a test, but we don't study hard at [wd3,-1] usual.
So just before the exam, we borrow a lot of books about "Haste" [wd7,s-] ,this is useless.
All the "Hastes " [fm1,-] are based on the basic learning.
Hard working can make us success [wd2,s-] , the "Hastes"is just a kind of help.
For another example, when we learn English, the new words is [vp3,1-] a very important part.
We should learn it everyday and relate [vp1,-s] for a long time, the"Haste" can't help us, if we believe "Haste [fm3,-] makes success", we'll be false [wd3,-] .
"Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] " is a proverb, which express [vp3,3-] that preparation is helpful before you do a thing, and haste perhaps doesn't do good for the thing.
Now I think everyone wants to complete a thing sooner, but if you don't investigate it ahead and make preparations for it, you will not do it effectly [fm2,-] .
On the contrary, you have to hurry and [wd4,-1] anxious, but can't do it well.
Now I will give you an example to express [wd3,s-] it.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] " is a truth.
It may include the following several sides [wd3,s-] .
First, one must grasp how to do it, it's [wd3,-3] technology and ways.
For example, if you attend a computer exam, however, you even unknow [fm2,-] the keyboard of it, you will be failed.
Second, you should have spent your time on it and could oparate it skilled [wd2,s-] .
This is like running a car, whether you only know it well but hadn't cost [wd3,-1] time to learn how to run it, you couldn't do it as usual.
So before we do whatever [wd3,s-] , we must learn it well and pay our attention on [vp2,2-] it for some time.
In alls [fm2,-] , we should be patient and hard [wd7,s-] to face everything, try our best to do everything well, haste only makes waste!
But the frequent phenomena [cc4,1-] is [vp3,1-] that haste makes waste.
The quick operate [wd2,s-] is often careless and smoothlers [fm1,-] .
For example, when we take part in a [np7,-1] examination, everyone want [vp3,1-] to finish the test in time or on [pp2,-1] advance, because of nervous [wd2,1-] or careless [wd2,s-] , the mistakes is [vp3,1-] unavoid [fm2,-] .
From above station [wd3,s-] , we conclude that impatient [wd2,-s] and carefulness are necessary when we do every things.
Only when we is [vp3,1-] very familiar with our duty, the high speed and good quality are attained at the same time.
"Haste makes Waste" [np1,-] means if you want to do something successfully, you shouldn't want to succeed at once.
Because you do something very Hasty [fm3,-] .
Can't offer you quality wanted [wd7,4-] .
The quality isn't good meads [wd3,-1] defeat.
That is to say can't arrive [vp1,-s] your object.
Fox example, a person wanted [vp6,-s] to study the knowledge [cc3,2-] of accounting to look for a job.
Then he think [vp3,1-] he has mastered accounting knowledge and get be [wd7,1-2] able to be a accountant.
Then he attend [vp3,1-] the examination to qualify himself to be a accountant.
He didn't study carefully while read [vp4,-s] it quickly so that he couldn't master it.
The example tell [vp3,1-] us: haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
My dear friends, I have something to speak with you: If [wd4,-s] want to do something and you want to succeed in it, you should do your best and have a pace after a pace [wd3,4-] .
Because "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] "
As a result, the teacher of the subject you write about will have a discount [wd7,s-] to your score.
 [np1,-] 
Five years ago, I studyed [fm2,-] in a small town.
So I didn't do as what she said and lifted much more.At the begining [fm1,-] , I could lift it quickly.
After a while, I was very tired, but, I tried, suddenly I fell into [wd3,-2] the road.
My mother came up to me, staring at me and saying:?Not anxious [wd3,s-] whatever you do.
Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
because [fm3,-] every thing has its own content [wd3,s-] .
If one of them is disappeared [vp1,s-] , the thing will be bad or useless.
But if you haven't accorded [wd3,-3] to these steps, you will never learn English very well.
Of course when you can rember [fm1,-] many words, so that you are able to read newspaper or about [wd5,s-] English magazines, you ought to continue [vp1,-1] read the words you have learned before and read the new words you haven't known.
If you do so, your English level [wd5,1-] will be better, otherwise, you only know one letter or the few words, and never learn well.
In case you want to get the purpose of it [pr1,s-] much faster, then you will not work hard but want [vp1,-1] get it at once.
Firstly, I said to classmates [np6,1-] :?If we run to it, and we can get there at 10:00?.
And when we got there, it was 2:00 P.M. Another time, I determined to pass Maths [fm2,-] exam two years ago, especialy [fm1,-] I wanted to got [vp5,2-3] a high score.
Every one of us expect [vp3,4-] to do a thing both well and quickly.
If we do thing [np6,1-] too fast, mistakes will be inevitable.
For example, we all began to learn English from [wd5,-3] several years ago.
I used to endure [wd3,s-] to recite all the cet 6 words in a week.
If you don't so by this sequence, it is very difficulty to well [wd1,-2] grasp English.
A man learns to walk firstly [wd2,s-] , and to run.
Just as we study in school, we almost experience the period of the primary school, the middle school, the college by step [np2,1-] .
So it is important not to do things hurrily [fm2,-] .
For example, when we studying, we must see to "Haste [fm3,-] Wakes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ".
 [np1,-] Because comprehension need [vp3,1-] time.
Only with the result that I had done many problemes [fm1,-] which I do know with wrong, [wd3,1-] and I had to spend time to correct them.
That was [vp6,-s] , I failed to [wd3,1-] the Foxbase
 [cc3,4-] 
In the developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality has [vp3,s-] changed a lot since [wd3,-3] these 30 years.
And the infant mortaility [fm1,-] in 1960 is 200 deaths per 1,000 birs [fm1,-] , while it is 100 deaths per 1000 birs [fm1,-] in 1990.
And a short [wd3,s-] number of babies died [vp6,-1] now.
From the results, peope [fm1,-] can realize [cc3,s-] the reasons that caused the changes.
For another, with the development of the science, people have more and more way [np3,3-] to treat the diease [fm1,-] .
And the good conditions made [vp6,s-] people more and more healthful [wd3,s-] .
The life expectancy and the infant mortality both have differently [wd2,1-1] changes in recent years.
From the above graph, we can see the changes of the life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] between 1960 to 1990.
Why did [wd4,s-] have these great changes?
The reasons are very [cc6,-1] many.
 [wd4,-2] Second reason is the development of the economy, people can use much money to buy what they want, so it [pr1,s-] can be meet [vp9,2-] the body's needs.
Third, that is most important in my opinion, is the advanced medical technology, it is because [wd5,-3] of this reason that makes the disease become slight and make people healthy.
But I can [wd4,1-2] sure that health gains will still [wd3,s-] have great changes in the future.
On the other hand, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] decreased rapidly.
With the development of developing countries the healthy [wd2,-1] condition will improve more rapidly.
One of the changes is that the life expectancy has increased and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased.
A liable data shows that the life expectancy has increased by 20 years from 1960's [np4,3-2] to 1990's and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased from 200 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births in the latest [wd3,s-] forty years.
The reasons about the changes are that the developing country's economy has greatly increased since 1960's [np4,s-] .
morever [fm1,-] , the medical thcnology [fm1,-] has greatly developed.
Thus the life expactancy [fm1,-] has increased and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has increased from 1960's [np4,-2] to 1990's in the developing countries.
According to the chart, Health [fm3,1-] gains in developing countries have achieved prominent progress in the past 30 years.
One can see that life expectancy has increased from 40 to 80 since 1960 to 1990, in the [wd5,1-1] meanwhile the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased from 200 %0 to 100%0.
It's an excellent performance [np1,s-] that both the life expectancy and the infant mortality have changed [cc3,-2] two times in the 30 years.
What caused [vp1,-2] this happen?
What's more, people have more money to buy nutrious [fm1,-] food to restort [fm1,-] to keep their body healthy and strong.
Secondly, the government cares [vp1,-4] more for the people than before.
Mordern [fm1,-] hospitals have founded [vp7,3-] and good doctors and nurses are afforded [wd3,s-] .
Thirdly and the most important of all, the technology are [vp3,2-] so advanced that many deseases [fm1,-] that can't [vp6,s-] be cured are able to be cured now.
From the bouyant [cc4,-1] progress, we can expect there'll be a further progress in health gains in the future.
Namely, the life expectancy has a good further [wd7,s-] of rising while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] will be increasing [wd7,s-] decreased.
In recent decades, life expectancy and infant mortality have great [wd2,1-1] changed in developing countries.
Life expectancy has great [wd2,1-1] increased, on the contrary, infant mortality has great [wd2,1-1] decreased.
It has increased [cc3,-5] one-third of the primitive figure.
Infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960, but, [wd4,s-] was 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
It has decreased in half [wd7,1-] .
First, economy increased [cc2,1-] in developing countries.
It caused the improvement of the level [wd3,-2] of life and the change of the structure of food.
Second, medical career [wd3,s-] make [vp3,2-] great progress and so forth.
In short, mainly [ad1,s-] , economy caused the change of the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
On the part of life expectancy, we can see, In [fm3,-] 1960, the life expectancy [wd4,s-] 40 years old.
In 1990, it reached 60 years old, with the [np7,1-5] increase of 20 years old.
On the part of infant mortaility [fm1,-] , the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
I think the reason is as following [wd2,3-] : First, the living standard of the people increased [wd3,s-] , people had enough food to eat and comfort places to live in.
So we can see, the health gains in developing countries is [vp3,6-] very exciting and may get better.
Healthy [cc4,-1] conditions have developed in developing countries.
Many aspects of the healthy [cc4,-1] conditions change, for example, It has stated that through [wd3,s-] the statistics [ad1,s-] : Life expectancy has changed from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
In 1960, there have [wd3,s-] 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but only have [wd5,s-] 100 deaths in 1990.
Therefore, the world economic [wd2,2-1] increased very fast from 1960 to 1990, the conditions of our life are also developed.
More and more technology of medicine are applied to [wd4,s-] , thus brought [vp6,s-] about a good condition for people.
Another reason of health gaining is the food and the labour, many people relived [wd3,s-] from the hungry and the burdon [fm1,-] of hard work.
In a word, good health and good heathy [fm1,-] conditions are gained in developing countries.
More and more people live in [wd5,1-3] a good life.
Compared the positive [wd7,s-] with the past, heath has gained in developing countries.
 [wd4,-2] Another example, the infant mortality has decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to about 100 in 1990.
All is showing a fact that heath [fm1,s-] gains in developing countries.
We are now living in peace and most of the developing countries have ceased fire and switched to developing economicy [fm1,-] .
Secondly, the living conditions have impoved [fm1,-] against [wd3,s-] the past.
became the topic [wd4,s-] .
Every country is tring [fm1,-] its best to develop.
Escpecially [fm1,-] , the devolping [fm1,-] countries have made great progresses.
Have a sight [wd3,s-] on the people's health in the developing countries, we can see it [pr1,s-] .
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] was decreased [vp7,s-] from the 20 persent [fm1,-] in 1960 to 10 persent [fm1,-] in 1990.
Two group [np3,1-] [np4,s-] simple numbers gave us the information of the improvement.
The cause to this progress [wd4,s-] mainly because [wd4,s-] the devolpment [fm1,-] of economy.
With more money and more commodity [np3,2-] , people have better food, clothing, medical care.
Better living condition makes people more healthy, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] can be decreased [vp7,s-] , the life expectancy can be increased.
Another reason is more and more people are geting [fm1,-] good education, more and more medical commonsense [cc4,1-] were [vp3,3-] known by people.
In [pp2,-3] according to the chart, from 1960 [wd4,s-] -- 1990, the life expectancy in developing countries has been keeping rising while the infant mortality has been keeping declining in those countries.
It is mainly because of the developing economic [wd2,2-] in those countries.
The developing economic [wd2,2-] provids [fm1,-] more financial funds, so the governments can improve the qualities both [wd1,2-5] of the people's living and medicine.
It is certainly [wd2,s-] that the health conditions in developing countries will be greatly improved if their economic [wd2,2-] keeps developing and the governments pay more attention to the people's health condition.
Healthy [cc4,-1] condition in developing countries get [vp3,5-] dramatic improvement in recent years.
We can see the development from the above gramphs [fm1,-] .
Another example is the infant mortaility [fm1,-] , in 1960 the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
the primary reason is the development of economic [wd2,3-] .
In recent years, most of [wd4,1-2] developing countries have succeeded in developing economic [wd2,2-] so they have much money to improve the condition of health and the standard of people's living.
At the same time, informations [np5,-] difuses [fm1,-] more and more quickly.
people [fm3,-] in the developing countries can get more information about health.
And the infant mortaility [fm1,-] also decreased.
They have paid much more attention and money for [wd3,s-] their health.
Second, the government [np3,-3] of those countries have gradually realized the importance of impoving [fm1,-] people's medical condition.
But there is still a great instance [wd7,s-] between developing and developed countries.
So we students should study hard to make more contribution for [wd3,3-2] our country.
The stardard [fm1,-] of economy isn't lower in developing countries than in developed countries.
In what situation does the populace remain [vp1,-3] the [wd5,-2] these countries.
Lets look over [wd3,s-] the figures of the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
The average life expectancy in 1960 was only 40 years old, but till [wd3,s-] 1990, the life expectancy added [wd3,s-] up to 60 years old.
At the same time, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] had been reducing.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but till [wd3,s-] 1990, the infant mortality was reducing [vp1,-2] 10 percent.
The increasing [wd2,-2] of life expectancy and the reducing of infant mortaility [fm1,-] , there was [vp3,1-2] many reasons.
Firstly, the economy in these countries had been developing and the living [wd4,s-] of people had been improving.
The nations carried out many methods, for example, they strengthened the medicine equipment and advanced [cc3,-3] some good measures, we believed [vp6,-s-] there was a great development in the future.
The life expectancy reaches [vp1,-2] to 60 and the infant mortality lowers to [wd3,1-1] 10%.
The reasons of these change [np3,1-] are varies [wd2,1-] from country to country.
Second, people's health [cc2,1-2] is confirmed by the advanced medical equipments [np5,-] .
With the development of the science and technologe [fm1,-] , people's living condition is certain to get better and better.
In developing countries the life spon [fm1,-] and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] had been greatly changed in recent thirty years.
The life spon [fm1,-] had been raised; in 1960, the life spon [fm1,-] was forty years, about half of the life expectancy, but to [wd3,2-1] 1990, it improved [vp1,-4] to sixty years old, about one point five times of [wd4,s-] 1960.
At the same time, the infant mortality was lowered, in 1990, there were one hundred infants died in every 1000 births, but in 1960, it arrived at [wd3,s-] 200 deaths per 1000 births, in spite of this, this all lowered the average [wd7,s-] .
What caused this [pr3,-1] changes ?
Further more [fm2,1-] , they do exercies [fm1,-] to make themselves health [wd2,2-] .
Because of the lelvel [fm1,-] [wd4,s-] their knowledge about infant increased, they looked after their baby more scientific [wd2,5-] .
Although [wd3,s-] this, the life spon [fm1,-] still lowers [wd3,s-] the life expectancy, We still needs [vp3,2-] to pay attention to the problem of our health.
Do our best to low down [wd3,s-] the infant mortality.
Why has the condition [wd3,s-] changed so greatly?
Firstly, with the development of social economy, people's life has improved, the structure of food has been more reasonable and the equipments [np5,-] of medicine has exchanged too.
Secondly, people pay more attention to the enegy [fm1,-] and their health, they do more exercises to improve it.
With the development of industry and agriculture, I believe the life expectancy [cc2,2-3] will be older, 100-year-old person will be not a story, and whatmore [fm2,-] , more and more older person [np3,4-] will appears [vp9,1-] .
From the chart, we can easy [wd2,1-2] find out two trends about the healthy [cc4,-1] condition in developing countries.
One is that the life expectancy is geting [fm1,-] long [aj3,s-] [wd3,s-] , the other is that the infant mortality is down [wd3,s-] .
From 1960 to 1990, [wd5,s-] in 1960, life expectancy was 40 years old, [wd4,s-] infant mortality was 200 per 1,000 births, but in 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years old, [wd4,s-] the infant mortality reduced to 100.
People can spend much money on food, living conditions, the other reason is that the governments have take [vp9,1-] some measures to better the people's health, every year they'll take out much money to set up hospitals and train many medical persons.
I think, with the development of the word [wd3,s-] , more and more people will live long [aj3,s-] .
From the illustration, we can see the facts: from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy rised [fm1,-] from 40 years old to 60, and the life expectancy increased by 50%.
And the infant mortality decended [fm1,-] from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100, and the infant mortality decreased by 50%.
This is a dramatical [fm2,-] change in developing country [np6,s-] .
Why did the change take place [cc5,1-1] dramatically?
In the developing country [np6,s-] , with the increasing [wd2,-2] of the level-life [fm2,-] , the individual medical measures [wd3,s-] improved.
The number of hospitals and doctors kept rising, the medical measures improved [cc5,-2] very much.
So the life expectancy rised [fm1,-] and the infant expectancy decended [fm1,-] .
With the development of society, the life expectancy has increased in developing country [np6,s-] .
In 1960s' [np4,s-] , the life expectancy is about 40 years old, and in 1990s' [np4,s-] , it is about 60 years old.
In 1960s' [np4,s-] , the infant mortality is 200 deaths per 1000 births, and it decreased to about 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990s'.
The reason of the change is that the standard of life [wd3,2-] and the medicine condition has [vp3,s-] been improved.
The technology [cc1,-2] of science has been developed quickly, which contribute [vp3,5-] [vp1,-4] the development of economy.
With the improvement of the medicine condition, the life expectancy has been increased and the infant mortality has declined [wd3,s-] .
This can be seen from the instructions [wd3,s-] given in Chinese [wd7,s-] .
In 1960, the life expectancy was only 40 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was as high as 200 per 1,000.
In 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only 100 per 1,000.
It [wd3,-3] is to say, people's life expectancy became long [aj3,s-] [wd3,s-] and the infant mortality reduced.
A study show [vp3,2-] that the life expectancy of developing country [np6,2-] is [vp6,s-] more than 60 years old until [wd3,s-] 1990.
That is to say, it will [vp6,-s-] increase [vp1,-6] 20 years than [wd3,s-] that of 1960, when life expectancy is [vp6,6-] 40 years old.
While the infant mortality in the developing country [np6,s-] in 1996 is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
Until [wd3,s-] 1990, it will [vp6,s-] decrease half [wd4,s-] 1960.
First in the past decade years [wd5,2-] , the level of economic growth have [vp3,5-] rised [fm2,-] rapidly.
People can eat well and can care for their health from [wd3,s-] adding the food of [wd3,3-1] nutritions [np5,-] .
Second, with the development of the technology, the chemically [wd2,1-1] facilities have increased and new medicines have been invented.
In conclusion, the rapid development of economy and technology lead [vp3,7-] [vp1,s-] to the life expectancy and infant mortality changed greatly.
In 1960 life expectancy was 40 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But in 1990, life expectancy was 60 years old, and infant mortality was 100 deaths per 1000 births in developing countries of [wd3,3-2] the world.
In [fm3,1-] 1960, because many developing countries gained independence not long ago, they couldn't have money to develop their economy, but after 30 years, with the help of the world the people in these countries make rapid progress.
In 1960 some developing countries had [wd3,s-] wars with each other.
I think with the help of the government [np3,s-] , hard [cc4,-1] people in developing countries will also have a good life.
The illustration showed us that life expectancy in 1960 was fourty [fm1,-] and it became sixty in 1990.
We also knew from the illustration that infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and it became 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
From these changes we realized that life expectancy was raising [wd3,s-] and infant mortality was becoming low [aj3,s-] .
The reason for these changes existed [wd3,s-] in two points.
First, material life [cc2,1-2] was increased in developing countries.
Second, mental life [cc2,1-2] was increased too.
For instance, in many developing countries, people couldn't feed [vp1,-2] for themself [fm2,-] in 1960.
According to the table [wd3,s-] , the expectancy has increased from 40 years old to 60 years old, on the countrary [fm1,-] the infant mortality is decreased from 20% to 10% in developing countries in the past 30 years.
Firstly, with the development of society, people can get more nutrious [fm1,-] food such as meat, egg and so on to eat.
This helps old people live longer and infants became [vp4,s-] healthier.
Secondly, medical equipments [np5,-] develop quickly in these countries.
By this means [vp1,2-s-] he can know what illness he gets and be [vp4,s-] cured more quickly than in the past.
In their free time they can do more exercise to keep themselves heathy [fm1,-] .
In different countries, people go to work, and realize their human [cc4,-1] value.
They write their different life travelling [cc2,2-] .
In developing countries, people work hard to make life [wd3,1-] .
Their health is worth worring [fm1,-] .
The life expectancy of developing countries in 1960's [np4,s-] was 40 years old.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] in [wd3,-2] that time [ad1,s-] of developing countries was two hundred deaths per one thouthend [fm1,-] births.
The important reason was that the food was not enough to [wd3,3-3] so many people in 1960.
And the developed contries [fm1,-] took hold of [cc3,2-3] the world econimic [fm1,-] , that made the [wd5,2-3] most developing countries's [np4,-] people [wd4,s-] in deep trouble.
Now, the developing countries's [np4,-] people stand up.
They by their hand [np3,1-] , by their pains, gain [cc3,-4] their own countries.
They are never to worry about no [wd5,s-] eating!
They also build they [wd2,3-1] industries, developing [vp4,s-] technology.
In the developing countries, the life expectancy is 60 years old, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is one hundred death per one thouthend [fm1,-] births in 1990.
In one word, the people's health is getting good and good [aj3,4-] in developing countries.
As is know [vp9,1-] [wd4,s-] above [wd1,s-] the chart given in Chinese , the life expectancy was 40 years old in 1960.
On the other hand, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] in the developing countries had decreased very much.
But in 1990 the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only half [wd4,s-] of 1960's, 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
It is important that the agriculture in the developing countries has developed, for it made it possible that more and more wheats [np5,-] and corns produced [vp7,s-] to feed on [wd5,1-2] more people.
Besides, the industrialization in the developing countries could contribute to them [pr1,s-] .
From this chart we can see the variety [wd7,s-] of the life expectancy and of the infant mortality.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy is expected to [wd4,s-] 40 years old while it is sixty years old in 1990.
Similarily [fm1,-] , the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 whears [fm1,-] it is decrease [vp9,1-] by 100 in 1990.
In 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
In [wd4,-2] old days, people didn't know how to use some useful things such as man-made product.
Nowadays, people not only manufact [fm1,-] synthesis [wd2,1-1] febel [fm1,-] but also refine [wd3,s-] some useful things from wild plants and animals.
Second, this is the result of the body [cc1,-1] quality of the people.
Man is eating animals's [np4,-] food [wd5,s-] such as fish and hens.
They are tend [vp9,1-] to eat the ingredient [wd3,s-] food.
The last thing, with [wd3,-3] the result of man's curing some fatal diseases, this [pr1,s-] mainly caused the decrease of the infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
The life expectancy of people and the infant mortality of [wd3,s-] the developing countries have a very [ad2,-1] changes from 1960 to 1990.
These [pr1,s-] can be known from above table [np6,3-] .
We can study [wd3,s-] that during 1960, the people's life is very short.
And the infant mortality is also higher [wd3,s-] , which comes to the numbers [np3,-3] of 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
But, in 1990, these situations change [cc5,-1] largely.
The life expectancy of the developing countries become [vp3,s-] longer, 60 years old.
As far as the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is concerned, which breaks [wd3,s-] down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why do the situations happening [vp9,3-] ?
With the level [wd5,-1] standards advancing, people can get the necessary things for their living.
Second, the medical conditions is [vp3,3-] better than befo [fm1,-] r. So people can prevent themselves from the illness, and staintain [fm1,-] their health.
In short, the advancing environment, as [wd3,s-] the economy, the medicine and other conditions result in the large changes of the life expectancy and the infant mortality of [wd3,s-] the developping [fm1,-] countries from 1960 to 1990.
According to the information from the draft [wd3,s-] , we can easily find that health gains in developing countries.
Secondly, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is decreasing apparently.
Thus [wd3,s-] in 1990 the infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduced down [wd5,1-] to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
I think the reasons that cause the great changments [fm1,-] [wd4,s-] as [wd4,s-] following.
First, medical technicals [fm1,-] have developed greatly.
Some illness that couldn't be solved [cc3,5-] in pass [fm1,-] can be cured easily now.
All these makes the changements [fm2,-] .
If people in developing countries work more hard [aj3,1-] than befor [fm1,-] our life will be better than now.
In the past years, the life expectancy [cc2,s-] in developing country is very small, and the infant mortality of these country is very high.
However, in the year of 1990, the situation have [vp3,2-] had a very large change.
The life expectancy in developing country is 60 years old, which is more [wd1,-3] 20 years than that of 1960.
And the infant mortality have [vp3,4-] decreased to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
All of [wd5,1-1] this show [vp3,3-] a profound change in the life of developing country [np6,s-] .
The reason of the change have [vp3,5-] [cc2,5-1] many.
First, the life [wd3,-1] standard in these countries has obviously improved.
So their healthes [np5,-] are very good [wd1,2-2] in condition.
Second, the development of the medicine [wd2,1-1] service results [vp1,-5] the increase of life expectancy.
As last [wd3,s-] , the world is relatively peaceful, which also is a [np7,-1] important reason of the change.
According to the datas [fm2,-] about the life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries, we can see that it has changed much since 1960.
The life expectancy's range in 1960 was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 20, while in 1990 it was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 60.
And the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was just [wd4,s-] opposite.
In 1960, its range was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 200, and in 1990 it was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 100.
So we can see that the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was declined [vp1,4-2] very much.
Why was the things [vp3,3-] like that?
We can understand it from these ways [wd3,s-] .
First, in the past, developing countries hadn't strong economic [wd2,1-] .
People in those countries were suffered [vp7,5-2] from serious disease [np6,s-] .
And in the [wd5,1-2] these days, the developing countries developed fast, so their people have had good life, especially in medicine [wd2,-1] condition.
Secondly, with [pp1,-4] the economic [wd2,1-1] goes better, the politicy [fm1,-] gets satisfactory.
Thus, people are living happily not only in material life but also in spirit [wd2,s-] life.
Thirdly, people have more spare time to live with their children than before.... With [pp2,-2] a word, the health has been payed [fm2,-] more attentions [wd4,s-] than ever.
In developing countries life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] taken [vp9,1-1] place at [wd4,-3] past thirty years.
Life expectancy, in 1960, it [wd5,s-] was 40 years old about [ad1,s-] , however in 1990, it's 60 years old.
Infant mortaility [fm1,-] varied from 2 percent(1960) to 10 percent (1990).
From [wd4,-2] above we can see those two aspects varied [cc5,-1] obovisouly [fm1,-] .
Why this variation taken [vp9,3-1] place?
By [pp2,-4] my view of point, first is the development of economy.
The developing countries are independed [fm2,-] which makes them develop their national economy.
Economy is the base of country [np6,s-] .
Second the government take [vp3,2-] care of people, they take measures to prompt [wd3,s-] people's healthy [wd2,1-] .
for [fm3,1-] example, the state set [vp3,2-] up all kinds of hospital [np3,3-] , this is benifit [fm1,-] to people's remedy.
today [fm3,1-] more and more people believe [vp1,-1] science, this will be good for their health.
In short, the variation of life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries showed the progress of the society.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of the world, the life expectancy will be more higher [aj3,1-] and infant mortality more lower [aj3,1-] .
From this chart, we can see that in the developing countries, in 1960, the life expectancy was about forties but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] deaths [wd5,1-] reached more than 200 per 1,000 births.
And in 1990, the life expectancy increased to sixties, on the contray [fm1,-] , the infant mortaility [fm1,-] deaths [wd5,1-] decreased [vp1,-4] about 100 per 1,000 births.
Why the life expectancy gets higher, but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] deaths [wd5,1-] per 1,000 births get lower?
There are three reasons: The first one is that the medical instrurements [fm1,-] is advanced, which can save more babbies [fm1,-] from the deasis [fm1,-] than before.
The second is the society call [vp3,2-] on people to preserve [wd3,s-] infants, and provides some measures.
The third is the human being [np3,s-] give more cautiousness to this question [wd3,s-] .
In one [pp2,1-1] word, the more quickly the country developed the higher the life expectancy and the lower the infant mortaility [fm1,-] death per 1,000 births.
In 1960, people's life expectancy of [wd3,s-] developing countries was forty years old, while in 1990 it was sixty years old.
Through this we can see that the developing countries' people [np4,1-1] life had become longer.
The baby's infant mortality, however, had decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births during [wd3,-3] the same time.
The foods became enough, the medician [fm1,-] conditions were greatly developed and people's living conditions were developed also [ad1,s-] with the development of economy.
All these made people's life of [wd3,1-3] developing countries better.
Now with these country 's [np3,1-] development, people's life is becoming longer and the baby's [wd5,-1] infant mortaility [fm1,-] is becoming lower.
It's certain that developing countries' people [np4,1-1] life will be more happier [aj3,1-] in the future.
As can be seen from the table, during the periods from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy is [vp6,s-] increasing from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
However, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is [vp6,s-] decreasing from 200 in 1960 to 100 in 1990, per 1,000 births.
Why did this case [wd3,s-] take place?
Some medines [fm1,-] could not be got.
With the development of civillization [fm1,-] , the medical standard is developing.
The [wd5,-1] both can be seen from the development of China.
When I was young, my family was poor, but now days [fm2,1-] , my family is changing much.
According to the chart given by the compersition [fm1,-] it is obviously [wd2,s-] that from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy is rising rapidly and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is reliving [wd3,s-] quickly in the developping [fm1,-] countries.
Why does this tread [fm1,-] come out then?
We say that it is because of the development of science in developing countries, people do [cc3,-2] any ways to increase their living level, for example, in our country, people do their best to develop agriculture, and do some experiments to increase the level of technology.
So people don't have to worry about [wd4,3-3] nothing to eat.
Many people in [pp2,-2] our ages know that we should eat clean food, not to [wd5,s-] eat food we don't [vp6,-2] eat before.
People also know [cc3,-2] some knowledge of medical [wd2,2-] , so they can apply them [pr3,7-] in their everyday lifes [fm2,-] .
In a word, it is the development of science that make [vp3,7-] [vp1,-7] the trend in the chart appeared [vp4,-] -- the life expectancy rising and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] going down.
There is a great change in developing country [np6,s-] about life expectancy.
In [pp2,-3] the same [wd4,s-] the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is changed.
There was [vp3,1-3] 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
From 1960 to 1990 the developing country [np3,s-] have a rapidly [wd2,-1] development in their economic [wd2,2-] .
Secondly, the developing economic [wd2,2-] impacts the development of the science.
In particully [fm1,-] in the medicial [fm1,-] .
The modern medicial [fm1,-] technology deduces [wd3,s-] the infant mortality.
The old people gained a good care of [wd5,s-] .
The reasons are not only what I refered [fm2,-] to above.
But I think [vp1,-4] them as the important reasons for the changs [fm1,-] of the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
In developing country [np6,s-] , people commonly have a longer life than ever.
In 1960, the life expectancy of the developing country [np6,s-] is 40 years old.
But contrary [pp2,-2] to that, the infant mortality decreases when it compares with 1960's.
In my opinion, it is largely due to the development of economic [wd2,2-] in developing country [np6,2-] .
In addition, with the development of economic [wd2,2-] , the medical conditions are improving accordingly.
In developing countries, the life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] had changed a lot during the past thirty years from 1960 to 1990.
It increased sixty years old till [wd3,s-] 1990.
On the contrary, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 and decreased 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why did it occur [vp1,3-2] this situation?
First, I thought that the standard of living had improved [cc5,-2] very much.
In 1960, human being [np3,s-] depended on the corn, less vegetable and eggs.
Till [wd3,s-] 1990, they would go to hospital before they had baby [np6,1-] .
The woman would be treated by doctors and nurses, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only half that in 1960.
Besides these two reasons above, there was [vp3,1-2] other reasons.
From the graph it can be seen that life expectancy has a [np7,-2] upward trend from 1960 to 1990.
Comparing [vp5,-6] with life expectance, Infant [fm3,-] mortality is just the [wd4,s-] way round, it has a downward trend between 1960 and 1990.
In 1960, Infant [fm3,-] mortality was 200 deaths per 100 births, while in 1990, it decreased [vp1,-2] a half.
Such eminent [cc4,-1] changes [wd4,s-] mainly because of two aspects [wd3,s-] .
One is the increasing [wd3,s-] of living condition, it makes people healthy.
The other is the progressing [wd2,-3] of medical service.
Of couse [fm1,-] , there are still other causes effected [vp5,5-2] such changes.
Life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] can indicate the development of a country.
In [wd4,-1] 1960's [np4,2-] , it's soon [wd3,s-] after liberation from [wd4,s-] domination of imperialist countries, many developed countries are [vp6,s-] starting to develope [fm1,-] their industry and economic [wd2,3-] .
At that time, people lived in poor condition and hadn't enough facilities to improve people [np4,-1] life.
Many people died of desease [fm1,-] .
Through thirty years' development, many countries have changed it [pr1,s-] .
Their economic [wd2,1-] develops fast, their people's life has improved high [wd2,2-] .
in [fm3,-] 1990, the expectancy raised [vp1,-2] to sixty and infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined [wd3,-] to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
This [pr1,s-] is what we expect most.
The life expectancy in 1960 is [vp6,5-2] 40 years and in 1990 increased to 60 years old.
The infant mortality in 1960 is 250%00 and decreased to 100 %00 of [wd3,s-] 1990.
Secondly, the countries economic [wd2,3-] developed in the 30 years.
Nutritions [np5,-] can be got.
Thirdly, The [fm3,-] medical level developed, people have enough money to build their hospitals and other constructions .Many kinds of deseases [fm1,-] can be cured.
Because of the mationed [fm1,-] reasons, health gains in developing countries.
Many changes have taken place in the world including the human's [wd4,s-] span.
According to the investigation, the life expectancy in developing countries is 60 in 1990 insteading [fm2,-] of 40 in 1960.
Meanwhile, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] of per 1,000 births is 100 in 1990 insteading [fm2,-] of 200 in 1960.
The reason that causes the huge exchanges [wd3,s-] lies in three points.
First, there is a fatastic [fm1,-] spurt of the productivity in many developing countries during these 30 years.
Secondly, the governments have paid more attention to the people's security, working conditions and nutritious [cc4,-1] protection, etc.
Thirdly, the developed countries are now declining [vp1,-2] the gains from the developing ones in trades.
This makes [vp1,-8] the latter can develop more freely than before.
The life expectancy has increase [vp9,1-] from 40 years old to 60 years old while the infant mortality declined from 200 to 100 in 1000 births.
From this change, we can draw a conclude [wd2,1-] that health gains in developing countries.
The changes in life expectancy and infant mortality lies [vp3,8-] in some reasons.
First, in the 1960's, most developing countries had gained the victory of revolution, with the victory, they developed their technology, which effected the medicine, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined and the people's life expectancy increased .
Secondly, people have more money to develop [wd3,-2] their diet.
which strengthened their bodies and made them with hold [fm2,1-] the diseases.
For [wd5,s-] the third people take more care of their bodies.
They take [cc3,-2] more exercises than ever.
For these reasons, people in developing countries have gained health in the past thirty year [np3,1-] .
With the developing [wd2,-2] of technology, people's life will be much longer in the future.
It's well-known that, today the developing countries develop rapidly, not only the development of industry, agriculture but also medical cases [wd3,s-] , trace [wd7,-1] cases [wd3,s-] , etc.
The society is becoming rich, and many [np8,-4] advanced healthy [cc4,-1] equipment are [vp3,1-] set up.
People also have more money to improve their live [wd2,-1] standard.
They pay more attention to live [vp5,4-] better and better.
With the improvement of live [wd2,-1] standard and medical [wd2,3-] , healthy cases [wd3,1-] , the life expectancy rises.
Meanwhile, people think babies are more [aj3,s-] important.
They do their best to feed their babies well, to bring up them [wd1,3-] well.
With the development of the developing countries, we are sure that the health can gain [cc5,-3] more and more.
From the information that has been affored [fm1,-] .
We can see that the life expectancy has increased from forty years old in 1960 to sixty years old in 1990, and the infant mortality has reduced from twenty persent [fm1,-] in 1960 to ten persent [fm1,-] in 1990.
This dedicates [wd3,s-] the health gains in developing countries.
There is much [np8,-s] reason, about these changes.
First, from 1960, there was few world war [np3,2-] breaking out.
People lived a more peaceful life than at [pp2,-2] the past.
The number of the victim [np3,4-] in the war had reduced greatly.
Second, the developing countries had paid more attention to the economic [wd2,1-] .
the [fm3,-] people's living condition [cc2,1-1] increased year by year.
The health are [vp3,1-] getting better too.
The number of which [wd4,1-1] [pr5,1-1] died of disease got smaller and smaller.
Most [wd4,s-] of all is the states paying more attention to the health of the persons [wd3,s-] in their countries.
From the chart, we drew a conclusion that the life expectancy increased rapidly and the infant mortality discreased [fm1,-] sharply from 1960 to 1990, in the developing countries.
This thing [wd3,s-] consisted [wd3,s-] in various aspect [np3,1-] of the society.
In this atmosphere, old people can take care of himself [pr3,6-] and adult people have enough time to look after their infants.
Second, with the medical development, the illness of old people can be controlled and the infant can be taken care of, many other aspect [np3,2-1] all can result in it [pr1,s-] .
In 1990, the living standard of people, raise [vp1,s-] all over the developing countries, the life expectancy of old [wd4,4-] rise and infant mortality [wd4,s-] down.
In the latter [wd4,1-3] of this century, great changes have taken place in life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
A case in point is china [fm3,-] .
In terms of [wd3,2-2] the chart, on [pp2,-2] one hand, life expectancy in 1960 was 40 years old, and it had increased to 60 years old in 1990, on the other hand, infant mortality in 1960 was 200 deaths per 1,000 births, and it had decreased to 100 in 1990.
I think there are two cardinal [cc4,-1] reasons about it.
First, medical technology improved, thus more wholesome [cc4,-1] babies are brought to the world .
Second, life conditions are better and better, people could pay more attention to the nutrition to [wd3,1-2] their diet.
According to the instructions [wd3,s-] , we can see that the life expectancy in developing countries increased markedly.
In China, the life expectancy was roared [wd7,s-] from 40 years old in 1960 to 80 years old in 1990.
At the same time the infant mortaility [fm1,-] decreased from 200 to 100(deaths per 1000 births).
Why the changes were [wd1,s-] so large [cc4,4-] in 30 years and what lead [vp3,1-3] to these changes?
At [wd5,s-] first, in that 30 years, most developing countries focus their attentions on the economic construction and they have gained great success.
That also make [vp3,2-] [vp1,s-] the life expected [wd2,1-1] increased and the infant mortality decreased.
The developing countries' life expectancy and infant mortality have appeared a great changment [fm2,-] from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old while in 1990 it adds to 60 years old, the reason for this changment [fm2,-] is mainly about [wd3,s-] the increasing [wd2,-] of life level, people are no longer hungery [fm1,-] .
They primally [fm1,-] live a happy and healthy life, so these cause the rise of life expectancy.
Besides the increasing rat [wd3,s-] of life expectancy, The [fm3,-] infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased from 1960 to 1990.
About 250 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960. it's [fm3,-] a very high number.
But in 1990, It's [fm3,-] down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births, the mainly [wd2,-1] reason of this rangs [fm1,-] is that the people's healthy [cc4,-1] condition has improved with the developing [wd2,-2] of medical [wd2,1-] .
People have controled [fm2,-] many influencing [cc4,-1] diseases and the quality of food and drink has been increased.
People's healthy [cc4,-1] condition is better than before.
With the developing countries [np4,-1] independence and development.
We believe that the life expectancy will [wd4,-2] more high [aj3,1-] , on the other hand, infant mortaility [fm1,-] will [wd4,-2] more low [aj3,1-] .
The above table indicated that life expectancy increased and infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduced in developing countries.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
The reason that resulted in the changes were [vp3,s-] chiefly the development of the science.
First, the development of the science resulted in improving the standard of life, which make [vp3,s-] people have enough food to eat, not worry about living, and lead a happy life.
Second, the development of science lead [vp3,4-] to the applications of technology in all kinds of field [np3,3-] .
People can get insurance of life, what's more the development of medicine made the infant mortaility [fm1,-] lower than before.
According to invastigation [fm1,-] , the life expectancy in advancing [wd3,1-1] countries is 40 years old in 1960; But it is 60 years old in 1990.
Infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960, but it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
First, the life condition is much better than before, the mortality [wd4,s-] of hungry [wd2,2-] is very small.
When a man or infant is ill, he or she can get good treaty [wd3,s-] .
Third, now more and more people are making [wd3,s-] exercise.
This strengthen [vp3,1-] their bodies and avoid many diseas [fm1,-] .
I believe there will be greater change in [pp2,-1] future.
From the graph we can know [vp1,-4] about the life expectancy and infant mortality have a great change from 1960 to 1990 in the developing countries.
Otherwise [wd3,s-] in 1990, people could live [wd4,-1] average [np1,-3] 60 years old.
At the same time, Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] has declined.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but it was only the half rate [wd5,s-] of 1960's when it came to 1990.
From that all [wd1,2-] , it show [vp3,1-] [vp1,-4] us a pleasure [wd2,-1] progress on health in developing countries.
What cause [vp3,1-] those great change [np3,2-] on earth?
The main reason is the development of their economy, thuse [fm1,-] lead to the development of the medicine.
A great change on [wd3,3-1] health has happened in these years in developing countries.
There are some fingers [wd3,s-] about the life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
In 1960, the life expectancy was 40 years old, and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was two hundreds deaths per 1,000 births.
While in 1990, it is reported that the life expectancy was sixty years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The under [wd3,s-] maybe [wd4,s-] the answer.
First, with the living condition get [vp4,4-1] better, people are fond of their life [np3,s-] .
Second, the level of medical [wd2,1-] was rose [vp9,1-] .
People needn't worry about the small disease no [wd3,s-] longer.
All of those reason [np3,1-] made the health gains in developing countries possible.
The health gains in developing countries is [vp3,6-] gradually changed.
According to the instruction given in Chinese [wd3,4-] .
We can learn about sth [fm2,-] .
In 1960, the life expectancy in Chinese [wd2,1-] was 40 years old.
But in 1990, [wd4,s-] increased to 60 years old.
But when it was in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
More and more people realize that healthy [wd2,1-] is important to a person, they did a lot to improve their constitution [wd3,s-] , [wd4,s-] build up their healthy [wd2,2-] .
This [wd3,s-] is a great accomplishment for human beings to make such a great progress in no less than half an [np7,-1] century.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of the world economic [wd2,2-] , science and technology, people become rich and care more about his [pr3,6-] life and the future of his [pr3,s-] descendants.
Of course, there was no war like World War I and II, the peaceful environment give [vp3,3-] more vigor to the developing [wd2,-2] of human beings [wd3,s-] in developing countries .Thus, the life expectancy rise to a high level and the infant mortality fall to a new [wd3,s-] level.
From the above graph we can see that the life expectancy of developing countries has risen from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has reduced from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The reason that there are such changes is that in the old days developing countries had brutal wars and was poverty [wd2,1-] , the people had not enough food and clothes .
Further more [fm2,1-] , the countries take on a peaceful look.
From the gram [wd3,s-] , we can draw a conclusion that the life expectancy is cresing [fm1,-] and infant mortality is decreasing in developing countries in the world.
During the thirty years from 1960 till [wd3,3-1] 1990, the life expectancy rised [fm2,-] from 40 to 60 years old.
Why did these changes took [vp9,3-] place?
First, the developing contries' [fm1,-] economy made a rapid progress.
This provided [vp1,-5] the enough production [wd2,4-] to the people to meet their needs.
Second, the qualities of the developing contries' [fm1,-] people also be [vp4,1-1] raised.
Many fatal dieases [fm1,-] transferted [fm1,-] among people was elimated [fm1,-] .
Third, the development of medicine can cure many incurable diseases in [wd4,-2] old days.
The health gains in developing contries [fm1,-] show the level of life rised [fm2,-] much.
First, the life expectancy of developing [wd4,s-] is 40 years old in 1960.
You see, the changes [cc2,-3] is [vp3,2-] so much.
At [wd5,s-] first, the economy of the developing country is the main reason.
With the improving [wd2,s-] of the developing countries people's living standard, the changes is [vp3,2-] expected.
Then, the peace of the world is also an important reasons [np3,2-] .
In a word, health gains in developing countries has [vp3,5-] made a great progress.
In 1960, the longest [wd5,s-] life expectancy of developing country [np6,s-] is no more than 40 years old and at that moment [wd3,s-] infant mortality is high.
It is estimited [fm1,-] that the total death rate of infant is 25%.
Life time [wd3,1-] is short and the death rate is comparely [fm2,-] high.
So many methods are adoped [fm1,-] to solve the problem.
They set up many public medical utilies [fm1,-] and called on people to pay attention to their physical exercise and keep bodies healthy by medium.
In 1990 the longest lifetime [wd3,2-] reached 80 years old and the infant mortality dropped by 15%.
Mankind's life in developing country [np6,s-] has been expanded [wd3,s-] with their own attempts [wd3,s-] .
With the development of their society people realized [vp1,-4] how important to keep their own body healthy and the whole country's health gains equally.
From the draft [wd3,s-] we can see, in developing countries, life expectancy and infant mortality in 1990 are very different from those in 1960.
The reasons for the result are various, for example, the medical level's increasing [wd2,2-] and the economics' [wd2,-] developing [wd2,2-] are all essential [wd3,s-] .
Of all reasons, I think the economics' [wd2,-] developing [wd2,1-] is important, with the developing [wd2,-2] of economics [wd2,3-] , people's expenditure level is higher .
In conclusion, with the developing [wd2,-3] of the society people's life expectancy will be higher and infant mortality will be much lower.
The other issue that attracts our attention to [wd5,7-] is that infant mortaility [fm1,-] is on the decline to ten percent in 1990. against twenty-five percent in 1960.
With time passing, people's life expectancy still [ad1,-1] will prolong [vp1,1-1] and infant mortaility [fm1,-] still [ad1,-1] will be on the decline.
in [fm3,-] [pp2,-3] the one hand, people's physical life [wd2,-1] standard is gradually being raisen [fm2,-] .
With socialty [fm1,-] developing rapidly, in [pp2,-3] the other hand, people change their mind [np6,1-] step by step, because [fm3,s-s-] of it [pr1,s-] people know how to prefect their bodies, and they know how to take care of their infants, and so on .
So we need greatly change people's idea in developing countries, in order to make the people realize that [wd5,1-s-] How [fm3,-] important it is to stay health [wd2,1-] .
In the developing countries, the life expectancy is sharply [cc6,-1] long, and infant mortaility [fm1,-] is decrease [vp9,1-] .
This [wd4,s-] due to the health state is increase [vp9,1-] .
From 1960 to 1990, Chinese life expectancy increase [vp3,1-] [vp6,s-] from 40 to more than 60, but infant mortality decrease [vp3,1-] from 200 to 100 from 1960 to 1990.
What cause [vp3,1-] [vp1,-4] this health state increase?
First of all, living standers [wd3,1-] is improved in developing countries.
Not only did we solve our food question [wd3,s-] , but we attach importance to nutritions [np5,-] : Second, with the living standard improved, our medical stander [wd3,1-] is also improved.
We can cured [vp9,1-] many of [wd5,1-2] deadly diseases, not to saying [wd3,s-] of light illness, another, our spirits is [vp3,2-] higher than before, and this also lead [vp3,2-] to health gains .
By and large, developing countries are developing [vp1,-4] to flourish and strength.
With the development of the science and technology, the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries have a great change.
The reasons in [wd5,1-1] which caused the change are various.
And, with the development of the living conditions in the developing countries, they have contained [wd3,s-] more and more chances to overcome [cc3,-3] the infant mortality and to increase the life expectancy.
Today, in the developing countries, the life expectancy is increasing while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is declining.
From the graphs, we can find that, from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy has increased from forty to sixty, and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has declined from two hundred and fifty deaths per 1,000 births to only 100.
This makes it possible that people can live well and their heath could be well [ad2,s-] .
Second, people's technologe [fm1,-] of medicine has increase [vp9,1-] .
This makes infant mortality declinedly [fm2,-] .
These changes is [vp3,2-] the reflect [wd2,4-4] of development of our society.
Recently, there are great changes in developing countries, the most [wd4,s-] of those is the change of health, including the life expectancy and infant mortality.
In developing countries, the people live more and more longer [ad3,3-] , but the infant mortality become [vp3,3-] large [wd3,s-] , why does it happen like this ?
The most important [wd4,-3] of [pp1,1-] which [pr1,s-] is the notice [wd7,-] of health.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of medicine [wd2,-1] cause more and more people can live better than before, In 1960 the life expectancy is 40 at [pp2,-2] the average but in 1990, it becomes 60 years old and some can live much older.
However, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is different in 1960, the rate of death was 200 deaths per 1000 births, but in 1990 it was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of science and technology, more and more people can live longer, developing countries gain the health of people .
As a developing country, China, its health gains is instructed [wd3,s-] by two pictures -- life expectancy and Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] .
The second, with the level raising of the people's life condation [fm1,-] , people grow stronger and stronger, so they can reject [cc3,-5] some of the bad condations [fm1,-] .
And the third reason, many developing countries(China included), have carried out [cc3,1-2] limited births and so on.
See Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] , in 1960, there are 250 deaths per 1,000 births, and 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
Another, the life level is improved, and these countries have carried out [cc3,1-2] limited births.
Of course, there are many other reasons to [wd3,2-1] these [pr3,s-] .
Health gains in developing countries have gained the important notion [wd7,s-] of the world.
Now, let us give a back [cc4,-1] look on [wd3,s-] the life expectancy of the developing countries in 1960 and 1990.
During the long 30 years, life expectancy rises by 20 year [np3,2-] .
Infant mortaility [fm1,-] also proves a truth [wd7,s-] .
In 1960, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 20 percent.
These countries can have healthy [cc4,-2] , developed hospitals.
Second, in recent years, many countries have formed a lot of birth policy [np3,4-] , and they can get a lot of good things.
From this policy, we have high birth-born [fm2,-] babies [wd7,s-] .
From the upper [wd3,-1] chart we can see that the life expectancy is creasing [fm1,-] .
From 1960 to 1990, the Developing [fm3,-] countries [np4,-2] life expectancy is improving from 40 years old to 80 years old.
At the same time, the Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] is decreasing too [wd5,s-] from 1960 to 1900. it's [fm3,-] deaths ratios has decreased from 250 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why do life expectancy crease [fm1,-] and infant mortality decrease in the these years in developing countries?
There are two reason [np3,1-] about it.
A good medical level can bring [vp1,-s-] infant mortality declining and people life extending.
Now, In [fm3,-] developing countries, As [fm3,-] technology developing [vp4,s-] , The [fm3,-] medical level becomes more and more advance [wd2,3-] , which make people live longer.
After the [wd5,-3] world war [fm3,1-1] II, the developing countries's [fm2,-] life level has great improvement, encnomic [fm1,-] level has high development [cc4,1-] , which make [vp3,s-] [vp1,-s-] people's life expectancy creasing [wd3,5-] and infant mortality decreasing, too.
Here, I will explore [wd3,s-] some cases on the changes of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
First, let us look at the figues [fm1,-] above.
Both of [wd5,1-1] figues [fm1,-] inform us the difference between [wd4,s-] in 1960 and 1990.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births but in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Apparently, the life expectancy rises while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduces.
It is a good news [np5,2-] .
The reasons of these changes are: First, because of the development of country [np6,s-] , the living conditions are improved.
The [wd5,s-] third, the secince [fm1,-] is developed [vp7,3-1] quickly, it make [vp3,1-] many fields develop fast, these fields include medicine, living environment and so on .
All make [vp3,1-] people live longer and make infant die [cc5,-1] smaller.
In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old, but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
In 1990, the life expectancy is 60 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
From the change we can conclude that the developing countries have maken [fm2,-] great progress over [wd3,s-] the 30 years.
Since 1960, the developing countries have take [vp9,1-] many measures in economic development, environmental protection.
At the same time, the stander [wd3,1-3] of the consumer [wd2,4-] is increased.
The developing countries have maken [fm2,-] such progress, [wd4,s-] they can make greater progress in the future.
With the development of the world's economic [wd2,1-] , the conditions of developing countries have made a superous [fm1,-] progression [wd2,2-] .
The life expectancy and the infant mortality are included [wd7,s-] .
With the development of economic [wd2,2-] , both [wd4,-1] these had made obvious changes.
Both the changes were due to the development of economic [wd2,2-] and other relative [wd7,s-] aspects of the society.
And with the development of the society, the conditions will become more precious [wd7,s-] than ever.
However, In [fm3,-] 1990, the life expectancy increased.
Why did it [pr2,s-] take place so many changes.
 [wd1] Because the medical circumstances have developed which ensures the babies [np4,-1] births.
What's more, people have enough money to buy what they want to eat and which [pr5,s-] will be well [ad2,s-] for their health.
During the past few decades, the health [cc2,s-] of the people of developing countries increased greatly, just as the instruction [wd3,s-] telling [vp4,4-1] us.
On [pp2,-2] one hand, from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy in developing countries has went [vp9,1-] from 40 years up to 60 years.
The causes to these changes can [vp9,-1] summarized generally as followed [wd2,1-] .
First, the developing countries have developed [vp1,-6] their economy to a higher level, which according [wd2,s-] increased the living standards of their people.
Second, the medical technology has been greatly went [vp9,4-] up, thus old people could live longer and the infants could grow healthily .
It's [pr2,s-] in [wd5,1-2] no doubt that these changes will certainly maintain.
From the table [wd3,s-] , in developing counties [wd3,2-] , the trend of both the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is obvious.
From 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy had rised [fm2,-] , while the infant mortality had dropped down greatly.
The life expectancy in 1960 was forty year [np3,1-] old.
In the same year, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births, which is very high, in 1990, the life expectancy increased and came to sixties [wd3,-3] years old, twenties [wd3,-1] year more than that of 1960.
Meanwhile, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] diminished by only 100 deaths per 1000 births [wd7,7-] .
Secondly, The [fm3,-] health conditions had been improved greatly.
Thirdly, the life of people were [vp3,4-] better than before, they had enough and nourish food to eat .
There still [ad1,1-2] being [vp4,2-] other reasons contributed to the heathy [fm1,-] gains.
Today, with the development of live [wd2,-1] level in developing countries.
For instance, life expectancy only attained [wd3,s-] 40 in 1960 in China showed in the table.
But in 1990 the situation was changed much, life expectancy has attained [wd3,s-] 60 .
Firstly, developing countries have provided [cc3,-2] some policy [np3,1-] to insure [wd3,2] people's health, they improved people's live [wd2,-1] levels according to [wd3,s-] advancing the productivity.
Secondly, people in developing countries were aware of the importance of health they took exercises and joined [cc3,-2] some sports to make them stronger and stronger .
I believe life expectancy and infant mortality must change [cc3,-2] to benifit [fm1,-] to people in the future.
Many changes had taken place about life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries.
There was a rise about [wd3,2-1] life expectancy.
On the other hand, there was a decline about the infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
In 1960, one-fifth infants died of [wd3,s-] 1000 births, while in 1990, one-tenth infants died.
In addition to [wd5,2-2] , Many [fm3,-1] Health organizations had been established so that they protected people from the illness.
It is showed that the life expectancy has increased steadily from 1960 to 1990, and it is also showed that the infant mortality has decreased so quickly since 1960, so the infant mortality on [pp2,-2] the 1990's is half of it [pr2,s-] , in the 1960's .
First, with the development of the national economy in the developing country, the state provides well-condition [fm2,-1] healthy [wd2,-] facilities.
Second, people's living has improved rapidly since 1960's [np4,-] .
Third, many lows [wd3,s-] have been layed [fm2,-] down to improve the health.
The last [wd3,s-] , medicine has been improved very much.
most [fm3,-] of the deseases [fm1,-] can be cured; only rare cases such as cancer can't be cured.
I hope that the people will be better-off [fm2,-] , and the life expectancy become longer and longer, the infant mortality, turn less and less in the developing country [np6,s-] .
Through observation, we can see that the life expectancy in developing countries increased and the infant mortality decreased [cc5,-1] heavily.
The progress of economy and the rising [wd2,-2] of living standard [np6,2-2] of the people accounts [vp3,s-] for the change.
From the chart that is shown, we can draw a conclusion that in the period of 1960-1990, there was a distincter [fm1,-] turning [wd3,s-] in both life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
Life expectancy was rising however [wd3,s-] infant mortaility [fm1,-] is belowing [fm2,-] .
In my opion [fm1,-] , there are some reason [np3,1-] for this thing that happened in developing countries.
In 1960, both the economic [wd2,1-] and the tecnology [fm1,-] in these countries are poor, they could not provide enough food and chemical [np6,s-] for their people, so the life expectancy is only 40 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births .
With the development of the periods [wd7,s-] , these countries have took [vp9,1-] on a new look.
they [fm3,-] have revolutions in science and economic [wd2,3-] .
now [fm3,-] , people have enough money to buy better food and chemical [np6,3-] , and now, their opion [fm1,-] of health is changed.
they [fm3,-] take all sorts of exercise [np3,3-] to develop [cc3,-2] their body.
As we can see the life expectancy is raised almost 60 year old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] belowed [fm2,-] to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Nowdays [fm1,-] , health gains in developing countries.
We can see it from two aspects as follow [vp3,1-] .
Second, the infant mortality has greatly changed also [ad1,s-] , it has declined by half since 1960 in which it was 200/1000 .
One, after the [wd5,-3] world [fm3,-2] war II, nearly all developing countries in the world have switched their attention to develop [vp5,5-2] their economics [wd2,s-] .
without [fm3,-s] war in developing countries people con't [fm1,-] die during [wd4,-1] prime and the conceived [cc4,-1] women can produce [cc3,-2] their babies well.
Life expectancy is more enlonging [fm2,-] in 1960 than that in 1990, while infant mortaility [fm1,-] has obviously decreased from 1960 to 1990.
At the same time, we can know that infant mortaility [fm1,-] in 1960 was high [aj1,-3] to percent 20 [wd1,1-] , however, until 1990, it decreased to percent 10 [wd1,1-] .
The [wd5,s-] first, I think, is the increase in their people's life standard.
In recent years, the developing countries have made great progress in their economic [wd2,2-] .
Secondly, medical [wd2,s-] has a rapid development which helps people to live long and make it possible to decline the death of infants.
Thirdly, more and more people begin to believe [vp1,-] science which will be helpful to improve their knowledge of life.
It also can make them know how to protect their bodies [wd3,s-] and to build up their bodies.
This effects [vp1,-s-] that the people's life expectancy is high while the infant mortality is low.
As the investigation showing [vp4,3-] , in 1990, life expectancy is 60 years old while in 1960 it was only 40 years old, but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 10% in 1990 while 20% in 1960.
Obviously life expectancy is higher than before and infant mortaility [fm1,-] is lower than before.
What lead [vp3,1-] to such affects [wd3,s-] in developing countries?
The first cause is that from 1960 to 1990, the world is peaceful, every countries [np3,1-] are making their effort [np1,-3] into developing products to raise the people's living level.
The second cause is that the morden [fm1,-] medical technologies have improved with the morden [fm1,-] science developing.
The third cause is that there is [vp3,1-2] few war [np3,1-] happened [vp5,s-] in the world .
In a word, during the 30 years, people can live a good living [wd2,2-] and have a good medical [wd4,2-3] for their health.
Great improvement of heath [fm1,-] has been gained in developing countries.
For example, from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy had been raised from 40 to 60 years old, and infant mortality had declined to half of the past [wd7,s-] .
So, less [np8,-1] infants are facing death and people live longer and longer.
The change comes from the two important development [np3,2-] during [pp2,-2] the past, food and medicine.
On the other hand, when they get illness, the development [wd2,1-2] medical method can help them survive it, so less [np8,-1] people face death dangerous [wd2,1-] , and can live loner .
To life expectancy, the average age was 40 years old in 1960, however [wd3,s-] 60 years old in 1990.
While to infant mortality, in 1960, it reached 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but to [wd3,1-1] 1990, it decrease by 50%.
First, with the development of developing countries, people become richer, and More [fm3,-] and more people can afford to see a doctor when they are ill.
For example, governments provide [vp1,-4] much money on medicine, setting up special hospitals.
All this leads to health [wd7,s-] of the developing countries.
From the chart, we could find life expectancy increasingly rise and infant morltaility [fm1,-] decline from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, life expectancy only have [vp3,3-] forty years [cc1,-2] of age, but it rose to sixty years [cc1,-2] of age.
While infant mortaility [fm1,-] have [vp3,2-] a great change.
Each per [wd5,1-] 1000 births deaths have 200 persons in 1960 but it increasingly [cc5,-1] decline [vp3,-] 100 persons in 1990.
From [wd4,-2] above facts these changes [cc2,s-] have a lots [np6,1-] of reasons.
The main reason is that these country of ecnormy [fm1,-] has literally [cc5,-1] risen in the lastest [fm2,-] years.
And the condition of medical [wd2,2-] has improved a lot.
With the level of life improving, people take all the sports and build up their body [np3,1-] .
While people have controled [fm2,-] infant mortality with their efforts from 1960.
All the evidence show [vp3,3-] the health have [vp3,2-] improved in developing countries from 1960 to 1990.
They [pr1,s-] will have a brilliant future in health.
But thirty years later, it raised [vp1,-1] rapidly, it became 60 years old in 1990 [sn,s-] .
There are two main factors: First, people's life is changed, the food is enough, few people die from hungry [wd2,2-] , and with the increase of food, people become [vp9,-1] pay more attention to the nutrilist [fm1,-] structure of food, which invoied [fm1,-] many diseses .
The doctors now can cure many diseases which was [vp3,s-] incurable in the past.
On [wd3,-1] conclude [wd2,1-] , the change of life expectancy and infant mortality is [vp3,s-] connected with the development of economy and technic [fm1,-] .
From above [wd4,1-] , we can see such a fact: In the developing countries, life expectancy was from 0 to [wd5,3-] 40 years in 1960, while in 1990 from 0 to [wd5,3-] 60 years old; The highest infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960, but in 1990 it was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
in [fm3,-] a word, life expectancy was increasing, infant mortality was declined [vp7,s-] .
I think that it [pr2,s-] has three reasons: firstly, the people's living level was greatly improved with the development of technology, people can produce more and more highly nuturious [fm1,-] food and pay attention to their diet's structur ; Secondly, medical institutes have been set up in recent years.
it [fm3,-] applies [wd3,s-] people with all sorts of medicine and keep up their health; thirdly, people can take part in all kinds of relaxation.
They makes [vp3,1-] them happy.
Judging [np1,-3] to the graph, it is very easy to know that the life expectancy in the developing country distinctly improved from the [wd5,-3] fourty [fm1,-] years old in 1960 to the [wd5,-3] sixty years old in 1990.
It increased [cc3,-2] 1.5 times from 1960 to 1990.
On the contrary, the infant mortality discreased [fm1,-] two times from the 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to the 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
The reason that causes the transformation [wd3,s-] may lie in three aspects.
Firstly, with the development of the society, the people's life standards increases [vp3,1-] .
Secondly, the government pay [vp3,2-] attention to the health of the people, they offer some money to increase [cc3,-2] the conditions for the people's health, for example, they built some hospitals .
Finally, people often take part in some activities, [wd4,s-] playing football, table-tennis and so on.
So it appears [vp1,-3] the above case.
In [pp2,-3] the same time infant mortality has been decreased [vp1,-s-] about 200 deaths per 1,000 births to about 100 deaths per 1000 births.
I think they can be due to [wd4,1-2] following facts.
So the government had enough money to eastablish [fm1,-] public facillities [fm1,-] , such as hospital, health centre and so on.
With life being bettered, health gains in the world, particularly in developing countries, such as life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
In 1960, life expectancy was on the average 40 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] was on the average 200 deaths per 1,000 births while in 1990, life expectancy became on the average 60 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] became on the average 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Food and drink was [vp3,3-] provided [cc5,-1] enough.
House was soluted [fm1,-] .
There are a number of hospitals and advanced equipment was set [wd4,s-] .
Third, people have realise [fm1,-] that sports is important.
To build up their health, people have [cc3,-2] a swim, have [wd3,s-] a ball, have a run and so on.
As can be seen from the table [wd3,s-] that life expectancy of developing countries has greatly changed.
It rise [vp3,1-] from 40 years old to 60 years old during the period from 1960 to 1990.
First, with the development of economy, the people's life conditions and knowledge have improved, so they have better conditions to live longer, and take good care of infant [np6,s-] .
Secondly, the development of medical system [np6,s-] [cc2,s-] could cure more disease [np3,s-] than before.
From the above chart we can see that the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] had changed greatly in deveoping [fm1,-] countries from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy was 40 years old and until [wd3,s-] 1990 it increased to 60 years old, 30 years older in 1990 than in 1960.
However, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] decreased.
In 1960, 200 infant [np3,1-] died [wd1,2-3] per 1,000 infants and it decreased to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What was the causes [vp3,3-] of the great changes?
The nutritions [np5,-] of foods were more plenty too.
Second, most developing countries paid more attention to their medical structure [wd7,s-] .
I am confident that the situtions [fm1,-] will be better in [pp2,-1] future.
In the 1960s, the life expectancy of the developing coutries [fm1,-] is 40 years old, but in the 1990s, It [fm3,-] is 60 years old.
In the 1960s, there are 200 deaths in 1,000 births but in the 1990 There [fm3,-] are only 200 death in 1,000 births.
The people of these countries have no enough food for eating, theire [fm1,-] economy develops very slow [wd2,2-] .
The condition of medical [wd2,2-] of these countries is rather poor.
So, the life expectancy in the 1960s in developing countries is low and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is high.
all the condation [fm1,-] has changed.
theire [fm1,-] economy and medical cause [cc2,1-1] increase.
People realized that the heath [fm1,-] of the body is very important.
So, many changes have happed [fm1,-] .
From the table we can see that, in developing countries, the life expectancy was 40 years in 1960; but in 1990 [wd4,s-] was 60.
That is to say, the life expectancy has lenghented [fm1,-] 20 years from 1960 to 1990.
The infant mortality rate was 20% in 1960, which decreased 10% during the thirty years, indicating [wd7,s-] 10% in 1990.
I think there are two reasons for this changing [wd2,3-] .
Secondly with the new technology applying to medicine field, doctors can cope with all kinds of diseases which they used not to [wd4,s-] , which contributes greatly to lengthen just the life expectancy.
I think with the development of the developing countries, the conditions will become better than this [wd3,s-] .
In developing country [np6,2-] , during the time from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy and infant mortality have changed very much.
What did the changes bring [vp7,d] about?
In 1960, in many developing country [np3,2-] , food is inadequate, medical condition is very bad .
They take [wd3,-3] attention to the relation between nutrition and health.
This is the reason of society developing [wd2,2-] , too.
According to the picture, we can get the conclusion that in developing countries, the life expectancy is becoming longer, and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is discreasing [fm1,-] .
For the infant mortaility [fm1,-] , in 1960 there is 200 deaths per 1000 births, in 1990, there is only 100 deaths.
The reason that caused these changment [fm2,-] exsits [fm1,-] in pointment [fm2,-] .
It is the developing [wd2,-2] of the technology that cause the developing [wd2,-2] of people's living level.
Some sickness and disease [np3,3-] can be kept out of the door.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of technology, the life expectancy will be higer [fm1,-] , and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] will be lower.
We now can recgonize [fm1,-] that it is of most [ad2,-1] importance to develope [fm1,-] technology.
Since the 1960s, health conditioning [wd2,1-] of people has been improved greatly.
Secondly, the progress of medical business [wd3,s-] helps to reduce the infant mortality.
Thirdly, the stability of the developing countries may provide [vp1,-5] the people various comfortable surrounding, which to a certain content [wd3,4-3] contributes to make [vp5,2-5] them live better than ever, and in turn adds their life expectancy.
From this picture, we can easily obtaine [fm1,-] that during the past thirty years, life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] of the developing countries had taken [cc3,-2] great changes.
As it shows, in 1960 the life expectancy was only 40 years old, and infant mortaility [fm1,-] even reached [vp1,-3] to 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But till 1990 the life expectancy had increased to 60 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] had also [wd5,s-] reduced to 100 deaths per 1000 births accordingly.
With the development of the world economic [wd2,2-] , the developing countries also strenghthen [fm1,-] themselves in many field [np3,2-] .
At first they have more sufficient food supply, the strive [fm1,-] number has reducd .
The disease [np3,-4] , especially the infective illnesses can be controlled.
The third reason is that people has [vp3,1-] become more concerned about their living habits and patterns, which providing [vp4,s-] a more sanitary and comfortable enviorment [fm1,-] for themselves.
In recent years, the life expectancy of developing countries is higher than before, while the infant mortality drops [cc5,-1] clearly.
People becomes [vp3,1-] more healthy.
On the contrary, the infant mortality in 1990 was 100 deaths per 1000 births, highly [cc6,-1] lower than 200 deaths in 1960, People's lifes [fm2,-] are longer.
There are three reasons suggested: First, with the development of social economic [wd2,1-] , more and more people of developing countries have shaken off poverty.
Second, improve [wd2,-2] medical conditions [cc2,-1] survive [cc2,3-] most of the infants.
Third, fewer wars and the peaceful situation is [vp3,6-] the most important reason.
Now, peace and development are the two most important problems in this world, and developing countries' people will be more healthy than it [pr1,s-] is now.
From this timetable [wd3,s-] , we can observe that the life expectancy increases nearly 20 years old from 40 to 60 and the infant mortality decreases greatly from 200 to 100 at a ratio of [wd4,s-] deaths per 1,000 births.
So we can conclude that health gains in developing countries has [vp3,5-] improved greatly in recent [cc4,-1] decades.
The technology of medicine is improving greatly today, which caused [vp6,s-] the increase of the life expectancy and decline of the infant mortality.
Of course, other factors is [vp3,2-] important to health gains in developing countries.
People take it for granted that fresh water is unlimited, we can get [cc3,-6] no matter how much we want.
It isn't strange that people think so, because they think the resource of fresh water is rich, we also can obtain it in many ways [wd4,s-] rain, river, well and so on.
In fact, shortage of fresh water [cc2,s-] is very serious.
Besides, people keep water polluting [wd1,3-] .
In a word, global shortage of fresh water is one of the most serious problems [cc2,s-] facing us today.
I think people should take some steps to solve this problem, of course, firstly we should protect fresh water resouce [fm1,-] from polluting [vp7,s-] .
Then we have two ways [np1, 2-] : one is to reuse water, the other is to change sea water into fresh water.
Researchers have made progress [np6,2-] in this field.
I hope in [pp2, -1] future fresh water [cc2,s-] will not be short any more.
People always take it for granted that fresh water is much [cc6, -1] 
We can understand it from the following conditions [wd3,s-] .
Second with the dvelopment [fm1,-] of industry, the amount of fresh water used in industry is becoming larger and larger.
What shall we do [wd3,s-] with this?
But in long [pp2,1-1] view, we should controll [fm1,-] [vp1,-3] the populations rising and find an enomical [fm1,-] way to take fresh water from the sea, which covers most [wd4,1-4] surface of the Earth [fm3,1-] .
People lived [vp5,1-s-] in the city use cleaned water.
The water factory clean [vp3,3-] the water from rain or rivers and send it to families and other factories.
What make [vp3,1-2] matter worse is that factories use more and more fresh water.
Also [wd3, s-] many factories haven't enough facilities to clean the waste water before [wd4,s-] pour it into the river, so some of the rivers are polluted, the water from which can't be used to make fresh water.
And many of [wd5,1-1] forests have been cut down [cc3,s-] by human, so the temperature is getting higher than before, so much of the water is changed into steam because of the high temperature.
I think first we shall make [vp1,-2] know to everyone that the fresh water is in shortage.
Third, factories should be equiped [fm1,-] with high-quality facilities to clean the waste water.
Fouth [fm1,-] , the entire human race should protect the enviroment [fm1,-] to make a better world for our living.
So, remember that the global [wd2,-] is short of fresh water, don't waste it!
Most of us have a [np7,s-] concept [wd3,s-] that fresh water is normous [fm1,-] , we can't use it up forever, and we can receive it in many ways: rain water, river water, underground water, etc.
And pollution and population boom also increase [cc3,-2] the emergency.
we [fm3,1-] should realize the gravity [wd3,s-] and come up with some effective strageries [fm1,-] to that problem, reinforce the protection of our fresh water, clean polluted water.
we [fm3,1-] should keep in our minds that every drop of fresh water is precious.
Water, which is the origin of human life, is facing danger [cc1,-2] of shortage.
They may say that there is much fresh water from raining [wd2,s-] , it may also be brought from lake [np6,s-] , well [np6,s-] and so on.
But, as a matter of fact, fresh water is very limit [wd2,2-] .
On the other hand, Because [fm3,1-] of the rapid development of indurstry [fm1,-] , water for [wd3,s-] it increases quickly.
We should make laws to control the birth rate and to prevent indurstry [fm1,-] from lay [vp5,3-3] out [wd3,1-] dirty water to the lake directly.
People alway [fm1,-] suggested [vp6,s-] [wd3,s-] that there is enough fresh water on earth.
However, fresh water is in short [wd2,1-] in the world.
The water is used [cc5,-5] by the fatory [fm1,-] very much.
The pollution is secious [fm1,-] .
We must solves [vp9,1-] the problem of pollution to save our fresh water and limit the amount of people [cc1,3-] increasing.
The rivers flow year and [wd3,1-1] year.
In addition, lots of water sources were polluted and couldn't be use [vp9,1-] .
It is the [wd5,-2] high time for us to solute [wd3,s-] this serious problem.
If these steps work, we would have enough water in [pp2,-1] future.
Many people think that Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water will never be used up.
Those people think that since rain and river-water [fm2,-] will be used for ever, Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water will also be used for ever.
In fact, Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is in a global shortage.
Firstly, with the increase of population, the number [cc1,-3] of Water [fm3,1-1] Fresh [wd1,1-] to be used increase [vp3,s-] , too: More and more Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is used to [wd3,s-] people's life.
Secondly, the development of industry call [vp3,4-] for a lot of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water.
Many factor [fm1,s-] need much Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water to make machines work, to produce products.
Thirdlly [fm1,-] , pollution is also a factor which leads to the shortage of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water.
Some factories neglect the enviorment [fm1,-] .
They let the factories' waste-water [fm2,-] flow into the rivers.
It pollutes the river-water [fm2,s-] .
Fourthly, with the increase of temperature, more and more rivers dry up and the number [cc1,-2] of rain also decrease [vp3,s-] .
Should we make best use of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water?
It is certainly the [np7,s-] important factor.
To make best use of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is the duty of every citizen.
Secondly, to protect the neat enviorment [fm1,-] is also important.
I think a piece of [np9,2-1] law should be made [wd4,s-] that the factory which let its wate-water [fm1,-] flow into the river [np6,s-] should be punished!
Many people may think that the fresh water will never [wd4,s-] out of [wd3,s-] using.
And there is raining [wd2,s-] and snowing [wd2,s-] in many places.
Perhaps some one [wd3,s-] may think there is a lot of ice in the south and north of the earth.
However, there is [wd4,s-] global shortage of fresh water.
But water polution [fm1,-] is more and more serious in our society.
For example, factories give [wd3,s-] the waste water into rivers and lakes, and many field [np3,1-] can not be watered [wd3,s-] with the poluted-water [fm1,-] .
Otherwise [wd3,s-] , global shortage of fresh water is also because of the increasing population.
First, we may [wd3,s-] not waste the fresh water.
Second, measure [np6,s-] should be taken to keep the water from poluting [fm1,-] [vp7,s-] .
Above all, we may have a right situation [wd7,s-] to the shortage of fresh water.
Often [ad1,-3] people want to finish something more quickly, but often [ad1,-3] they can not do it well.
Thus, the things he (she) has done is in bad quanlity [fm1,-] , even nothing good can be found in the things.
Haste make [vp3,1-] [vp1,s-] you can't think [cc3,-4] about the thing enough, haste may make you excited or nervous, so you can't think carefully about what you must do, what you mustn't do and what method will be the best.
Or you may forget something important, it make [vp1,-2] you can't do what you will do sucess [fm1,-] .
For example, one morning you get up later [ad3,s-] , and you will be late to [wd3,s-] your work, so you are hasted [fm2,-] .
you [fm3,-] run down the stairs and run to your car then you find that you have left the key in the room.
And on the way to factory, because of haste you crash to [wd3,1-2] the tree on the side of stree [fm1,-] ....
So, by the end, you are be [wd5,1-1] late.
Why do we usually say Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste?
It contains a commen [fm1,-] reason that we should do everything step by step.
But in the condition of without enough proporate [fm1,-] situation we can not do the thing that we oppricated [fm1,-] .
For example, in economic areana [fm1,-] people usually want to get advanced technology and management.
So people quote [wd3,-6] many work lines from other country.
But without adequate knowledge to use them, parts of them are lain out of the way [wd3,4-] .
Thus we wast [fm1,-] large exchange [wd7,3-] .
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is on old saying.
For example, if you want to get [wd4,-2] a place by bicycle, but there is something wrong with the bicycle, before you begin using it, and you don't fix it.
So it will not work probably on [wd5,-3] the half way to the place, finally you will be late or can't get there.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is a good saying, we must remember it.
Every thing has its own regularity [wd3,-] .
When we want to do things more quickly, we should know their regularity [wd3,-] , and give [cc3,-2] a conclusion to them.
But the regularity [wd3,-2] is objective, not revert [wd3,s-] by the man's idea.
When we break the regularity [wd3,3-] , haste makes waste.
 [wd7,s-] 
We can see many things embody [wd3,s-] this theory.
When we cook, we make the fire big in order to eat the meat fast [wd3,s-] .
But, when we eat it, we find it taste [vp3,3-] [cc5,-1] ugly.
I think it [pr2,s-] is "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
 [wd4,-2] Other example, when we study history so many history books are in front of you, you want to be the [np7,s-] historian, so you read them one after one, not break .
At last you read them all, but, so many [np8,-1] knowledge in your mind only lead [vp3,7-] you into [wd3,2-] nothing.
You spent so much time, but get nothing, it is the same words "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
So we should not haste [wd2,s-] to do the thing, we must depend on our own base.
So it's necessary to illustrate and demostrate [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
In everyday life, we often have to do many things in limit [wd2,1-1] time, and we have to catch [cc3,-2] the time.
If we want to do them as quick [wd2,3-] as we can, we will become nerveous [fm1,-] and won't finish them in time.
So haste makes us nerveous [fm1,-] and disable us to do many things well.
They may forget to look [vp1,1-2] their house or to bring the key with them or to make their clothes well which often produces many jokes.
All these are resulted [vp7,s-] from their haste to reach office [wd7,s-] .
If we are under limited conditions, we should have [wd3,-4] it in our minds that will make us do our things better.
The old saying "haste makes waste" [cc2,s-] is very familiar to us.
First, one that wants to haste [wd2,s-] in a hurry often can't stop to think about the best way to success.
Third, as is know [vp9,1-] to us, a good rest is very important for one to reach success.
Whoever keens [wd3,1-2] on success will neglect [wd3,s-] rest and do everything ineffectively.
For example, Li Ming, one of my classmates, who want [vp3,7-] to get a good mark on CET 4, spared every moment to study English.
In the morning after he gets up, he began [vp6,s-] reading English with a piece of bread in his hands.
At night, he often stayed up to [wd3,2-2] 12 o'clock.
Unfortunately the day before CET 4 test he passed out [wd7,s-] and couldn't attend the exam.
In general, we must keep calm in front of success, consider [cc5,-2] everything well and think out a best way to success.
People always thinks [vp3,2-] that finishing things as fast as you can is a good thing.
In some cases, we have something important to do, but we have not enough times [np6,s-] , for example, we want to finish a drawing which have [vp3,4-] to be turned in.
If we do it in [pp2,-2] high speed, the drawing you finished is not a good one.
or [fm3,-] else [wd5,s-] , you like plantting [fm1,-] , but the tree can't brings [vp9,1-] [wd3,s-] up in days.
In [pp2,-2] this times [np5,2-] , we say "Haste makes waste" then, How [fm3,-] can we avoid "Haste makes waste"?
we [fm3,-] must take account in [wd3,2-] the rude [wd7,s-] of other.
We must base on the practise [wd2,1-] .
Obousing [fm1,-] the fact, doing our best, making use of times [np5,3-] , "Haste makes waste" will not happen any more.
When somebody does his work hastily, the more he want to haste [wd2,s-] , the more he couldn't do [cc5,s-] his work with patience.
As a result he could never success [wd2,2-] his work as he want [vp3,1-] .
For example, when we want to fixture [wd2,-2] a bicycle, we should do this with patience.
Otherwise we must spent [vp9,1-] more time doing it on the contrary we want.
Also [ad1,s-] , when we want to work hastily, we couldn't concentrate on doing it.
This is the [wd5,s-] why haste make [vp3,1-] waste too.
For example we want to read a book quickly, thus, we couldn't spent [vp9,1-] more time concentrating on it.
We can work well with the brieve [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
Everything can be done well in a pamtience [fm1,-] way, that is: "There is a will, there is a way," People must do thing [np6,s-] with condience [fm1,-] , nothing can be done well in a hurry way [wd5,3-] , when we do business, study and do experiment, with filled [wd3,1-1] condience [fm1,-] and pamtience [fm1,-] are very important.
If we want to do something well in a sort [fm1,-1] time, it [pr1,s-] will make wrong, that is, haste makes waste.
Because things have a course of development, and most things have to be done in serveral [fm1,-] steps, especially, when we do something, there is a time before success, for example, we can't grasp english [fm3,-] grammar in a day; we can't reach the moon in a step; and we have to study for years before go to college.
Everything have [vp3,1-] to be done well in a course [wd7,2-] .
In conclusion, things can be done well if we have pamtience [fm1,-] and condience [fm1,-] , but haste makes waste.
I will make more mistakes when I haste [wd2,2-] .
Because the anxiety disturbs [vp1,-s-] me that I can't concentrate in my operation.
Moreover, there are many accidents affect [vp4,s-] our life.
As I determine [vp1,-2] to haste [wd2,s-] , I will find that I have to face these accidents which I can't resolve [cc3,4-] .
At last, I will fail to arrive [vp1,-2] my object.
Once I took part in a [np7,-1] examine [wd2,1-] .
I wanted to finish it quickly and go [vp6,s-] to attend a party.
We often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste," but what is [wd3,1-2] its [pr1,s-1] means?
Let us suppose you just want to reach a [np7,-1] object [wd7,-] , you is [vp3,1-] too serious to realize what you want, so you will spend all of [wd5,1-3] you have had in order to finish the thing.
But when you try, you will find out [wd5,s-] that you do not reach your object [wd7,-] , and you may turn back.
It is "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
We can have a [np7,-1] example.
In our country, 30 years ago, the country masters [wd3,s-] wanted to reach the object -- every one can get what he want, so they called on the people to do many things we could not realize.
The truth proved what they had decided was wrong, the lesson [cc2,-2] is hard.
What does the words --"Haste Makes [fm3,-] waste" mean?
It's not diffictcal [fm1,-] for you to guess its meaning.
That is, if you do something in a hurry way [wd5,3-] , you often can't get your attain [fm1,-] .
That is to say, whatever goals you want to gain [cc3,4-] , you should have enough patience and do everything step by step.
Then, let me give you a [np7,-1] example to illustrate it.
If you force yourself to do many exercise [np3,1-] , and to learn hundreds of words everyday, you think you can learn English well in a short period?
Because you only pay your atention [fm1,-] on the haste, but ignore the way.
 [wd7,s-] 
And why it is [wd1,s-] true?
From my experience, I do exercises very quickly in order to make [wd3,-2] some time for enjoying music, but I always find that there are many wrongs [wd3,s-] in them, then I am forced to find them out and correct them, and it takes me even more time than that of doing them at common [wd3,1-1] speed.
They [wd3,-s-] are many events in history show [vp4,s-] the truth of "haste makes waste".
From the phrase "haste makes waste", we can learn much more than what I had [vp6,s-] said.
We should do thing [np6,s-] according to their properties, and we should not only seek less [wd3,s-] time.
Wanting to do something quickly but make [vp4,s-] a mess in the end, that is what calls "Haste makes waste".
When a man is so eagerly [wd2,2-1] to finish something in a hurry, what loads [wd3,1-2] his mind might be "quick, quick and quick"; then he will forget to think over every aspects of the whole situation comprehesively [fm1,-] , he will forget to make preparations necessary [wd1,2-] .
To make it even worse, because he is in such a hurry that careliness [fm1,-] and patience needed in doing the work are rare.
Then, the only consequense [fm1,-] will be a mess.
" Once a father told his two sons to cut down some branches and gave them each a steeny [fm1,-] knife.
The first one took the knife immediately onto [wd3,s-] the forest in order to be back sooner than the other.
But the second one took a look at the knife first, then trid [fm1,-] to make it sharp despite his brother's going working earlier.
 [wd4,-3] The afternoon, the second one went home with many branches, but the first one came home very late and had little [np8,-1] branches, and said, "the knife isn't sharp completely [wd3,2-] .
" [wd7,s-] 
So, when you want to do something well, you must not haste [wd2,s-] but make sure everything have [vp3,1-] been prepared.
For example, in studying [wd2,1-] , we often want to be the first at once, however, if we don't study hard for a long time, there is no doubt that this is impossible.
The improve [wd2,1-] of community economy [cc2,s-] is the same reason, if there aren't enough foundments [fm1,-] of industry and agriculture in one country, this improve [wd2,1-] don't [vp3,2-] come into ture [fm1,-] at once, instead, this action of improving is dangerous.
 [wd7,s-] 
From the above following [wd5,2-] , we can say: "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
Many people know there is an old saying "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
They always think that the more quickly they do sth [fm2,-] , the more achievement they will get.
Because when we do sth [fm2,-] , we should make a plan first, and obey many rules.
Or we will be at a loss, not knowing what should do [vp7,s-] and what should not do [vp7,s-] .
Just when the class was over, I heard the teacher saying " it [pr2,s-] would be an exam the next day, then I felt quite nervous.
As soon as I came back home, I brought out all the maths books and learned [cc3,2-1] it very carefully.
I was still learning [vp6,s-] deep into the night.
But the next day, when I get the exam paper, I was worried, Because [fm3,-] It [fm3,-] was not the maths exam paper, but an English one.
From the thing I have experienced, I know that when we want to succeed, we should remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" at any time.
And we should do things more careful [wd2,3-] .
Before [wd3,s-] , we had thought [vp6,s-] if we did something fast, we could get a good result, in fact, this idea is false.
Once, you decide to do something sucessful [fm1,-] you must put your heart into it, you must think of every details, you must spend much time on it, then you will be sucessful [fm1,-] .
Otherwise, you would be fature [fm1,-] .
For example, when we study English, at the beginning we started to learn English words, every day we must learn it, slowly and slowly [wd3,s-] we master more and more words, then we learned [wd4,s-] use of sentence [np6,1-] , we can speak English sometimes.
But it's [wd5,-s-] for me, this term I seldom learned it until last week, this week I studied it all day and all night.
 [wd7,s-] But now I couldn't [vp6,s-] do the paper well.
We often make this fault, when we do something, we always hope it finish more better [ad3,1-] more sooner [ad3,1-] .
This mood makes [vp1,-2] us going [wd3,s-] in an anxious state.
The progress of the work is slow [vp9,1-1] down.
Then, we became more and more anxiously [wd2,4-] .
The terrible circle [wd7,s-] is formed.
There are a lot of examples in our daylife [fm1,-] .
When I must face to [wd5,3-2] the final-exam [fm2,-] , I have to review [cc3,-3] all the knowledge what [pr5,s-] I have learned in this term.
With the examing [fm1,-] day coming fast [wd3,s-] , I still have many works to do.
I can't finish one thing if I still stick to use [wd2,2-] this method.
I must start from one thing and finish it before I have to [wd5,1-2] another thing.
Only in this way, I can make my study effectively [wd2,3-] .
A provd [fm1,-] says, "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
It means that sometimes people are anxious to achieve some thing, but because of carelessness or the other reason [np6,4-] , they usually fail in the end.
The phenomenon often happen [vp3,3-] in people's everyday life, for instance, three years before [wd3,2-3] when I studied in [wd3,-2] high school.
I wanted [wd3,s-] to go home on bicycle every other weekend.
Once it being dark, I'm so afraid of being caught in rain that I drove [wd3,s-] faster and faster.
But in the cross-road [fm2,-] , I was injuried [fm1,-] slightly, when the bicycle was turned over.
To make the matter worse, the parcel of books on the back of bike [np6,1-] was unwrapped and all books were scattered into apects [fm1,-] .
It took me half an hour to pick up them [wd1,2-] .
At last, it was still [wd3,s-] at seven in the evening when I arrived at house [np6,2-] .
Therefore, when we wanted to finish some thing in a short time, we must make [wd7,-5] good caution [wd4,-1] do [wd3,s-] with accidents.
Only if we do so, we can [wd1,s-] attain our aims.
When someone haste [wd2,s-] in a work, he may be much [ad3,s-] careless than usual.
So some mistakes will be made by him, which just waste [vp3,s-] his time at work.
For instance, in ancient China there is [vp6,s-] a scholar planned [vp4,s-] to enter a city before sunset because the city door would be closed then.
Judged from the distance, it was possible for him to get there with [pp2,-2] normal speed.
But he just hasted [fm2,-] , and the books on the back of his horse which he drove [wd3,s-] fell to the ground.
After he piled [wd3,s-] up the books, it [pr2,s-] was not enough time to reach the city then.
So he wanted to haste [wd2,s-] just waste time.
But you haste [wd2,s-] and are too careless to take something important with you.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is a saying that is used often by people.
But why we say" Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"?
 [wd7,s-] The first is people are too eager to make [cc3,-1] success, the second is people make acts [wd7,1-] when they don't find out good ways.
At [pp2,-2] this condition, good wishs [fm2,-] always don't bring good effect.
For example, in 1950's, the people in China were too eager to make our country in to [fm2,1-] a strong mordenizational [fm1,-] country, our leaders adopted the strategy of "The [fm3,-] great leap".
This strategy was very unthoughtful [fm2,-] .
So this strategy didn't bring our country advicements [fm2,-] , but also destroied [fm2,-] [cc5,-4] our country very much.
"Hates [wd3,-2] Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" make [vp3,3-] our many regrets [wd7,3-] , we should make [wd3,s-] lessins [fm1,-] in our life and stuies [fm1,-] .
Many people want to do something very quickly, and with little of [wd5,2-1] difficulties.
But, in fact, they can't realize [cc3,-2] their aims.
There is a raison [fm1,-] : Haste makes waste.
Firstly, we must consider [vp1,-2] of the situation where we are.
We can't do something that [cc2,1-3] is impossible to manage.
When we want to [wd4,1-1] something quickly, we often lose patience, and this will make our work more difficult.
Finally, there are many other causes, such as capablity [fm1,-] , money, circumstance, help from other people.
If we are impatient, we usually lose our heads [wd3,2-] and can't think of them [pr1,s-] .
So, all we try to do will becomes [vp9,1-] a kind of waste, a waste of force of man, a waste of money and a waste of time.
A student doesn't study well, but he want [vp3,1-] to catch up with the others in a short time.
Times [np6,-s] passes away [wd3,2-] , but he finds he can't do so.
It's only a simple example, there are many others in our vie [wd7,2-] .
And we can realize what we want to do much more facile [wd2,s-] and possible [wd2,s-] .
People always say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Wast [fm1,-] ," and I think it is very reasonable.
Whichever [wd3,s-] we wanted to do, we should do it step by step and can't [wd4,-1] impatient.
If we always complete it in very [ad2,-1] haste, we often make many mistakes even fails [wd2,2-] .
For example, we study English, if you want to grasp this language in few [np8,-1] time and I think it is impossible of [wd3,2-1] you to learn it well, because English as a subject you should know English new words by heart, study English grammer [fm1,-] and practice [cc3,-3] English spoken abilities and so on, and all this must spend your plenty [wd3,s-] time in grasping [vp1,-1] .
So, I think "Haste make [vp3,1-] waste" is a good guidance for us to do anything.
In our socialty [fm2,-] , [wd4,-3] Livings are progressing so fast that everyone believe [vp3,1-] time is money.
As a reason [wd3,2-] , we hurry to do everything we need to do.
But to our disappoint [wd2,2-] , the facts often are different with [wd3,2-3] our ideal thinks [wd2,1-] .
Let me tell you a phenomenom [fm1,-] in our studying living [wd2,2-] .
When [wd3,-1] examination, many students think time is not enough, so they finish papers fast then hand in them [wd1,2-] .
They [pr1,s-] told us that haste makes waste.
If we think carefully of it, we'll conclude that everything being [wd5,1-6] completed successfully must be prepared well.
Merely persuiting [fm1,-] haste will lead to failure innevitably [fm1,-] .
It's the same with our socialist, at first, we declared that we'll [vp6,s-] enter communicate [wd3,s-] sociatist [fm1,-] in three months.
History proved it's impossible, so today, our government go to a right steadly [fm1,-] way [wd7,5-] .
 [wd7,s-] 
Some people think that we must do everything as quick [wd2,3-] as possible, but is that be [wd5,2-1] so?
We all know the proverb Haste [fm3,-] makes waste.
It tells us that sometimes speed is not the most important things [np3,s-] .
Whether we prepare enough or not directly influents [wd2,s-] our outcome.
Good prepares [wd2,1-] need a certain [wd5,1-1] time.
For example, once doing a [np7,-1] experiment, I wanted to finish it in a very short time.
So I did in [pp2,-3] a high speed.
But after I finished, I found that there were something importance [wd2,1-] I had left out.
So we can say that what it is important is how good [wd2,s-] not how quick [wd2,s-] we do a thing.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is an old Chinese saying.
You must [vp9,-3] step by step, and you will laugh at last.
Why do people say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"?
You must obey [vp1,-2] to it, but not neglect it.
When you have great willing [wd2,2-] to finish it, you should set your heart [wd7,2-] peacely [fm2,-] , arrange [cc3,-5] all you [pr4,-2] whole matters correctly and then do it, otherwise, you will waste more time, even go backward for the factor [wd7,4-] you had done wrong.
That would prevent you from accompolising [fm1,-] them on time [wd4,s-] you predicted.
For example, in nighteen [fm1,-] sixties, our country had set up a wrong routine, which called [vp7,s-] "Great progress".
So they took everything that comsist [fm1,-] of iron into steel plant, in order to change them into steel.
But the result approve [vp3,1-] [wd3,s-] that it's a great wrong [wd3,2-] .
And after "Great progress" even our country [wd4,s-] backward a lot.
History [wd2,-1] experience alarming [vp4,s-] [wd3,s-] people "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
So, remember that old saying "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
Because if you haste [wd2,s-] , you always leave out a lot of details, for example, you want to improve your "comprehensive reading in a short term, so you do a lot of problem [np3,3-] in an hour, but you'll find it's [pr1,s-] still poor.
That's because you too haste [wd2,s-] that can't do a lot of details such as how to catch the main ideas, how to guess a word's meaning etc.
knowing [fm3,-] this you'll find that you improve little by little.
That's one of the reason [np3,3-] why haste makes waste.
There are some other reason [np3,2-] .
So when we do a work, we don't haste [wd2,s-] .
Because when you want to finish an important thing in a quick way, you always can not think of [wd3,1-3] a correct way or a wonderful method carefully.
Now I tell [vp1,-2] you below: the mean [wd2,-1] of the [wd5,-3] haste makes waste is if you want to do something, the haste will lead to failure or make you have to spend more time in finishing it.
The reason is that you lose your patient [wd2,1-] and you didn't consider it carefully before you do something, such makes waste.
For example, if you want to build a high house, you must build it from the first flore [fm1,-] to the highest flore [fm1,-] .
If you want to build the highest flore [fm1,-] without the first flore [fm1,-] , I think, that is impossible.
So you must build you [pr4,-1] house step by step with good material [np6,2-] , otherwise, you can't finish it.
Since we have known the reason why haste makes waste clearly, why we can't [wd1,s-] use it?
An idiom says that "Haste [fm3,-] makes waste".
Everything, and every process has [vp3,4-] its own course.
Sometimes if we want to fasten it [pr1,s-] , we only spoil it.
In this [pr1,s-] way, we prevent it from developing in its due course.
Perhaps that's the reason why haste makes waste -- we'll waste our energy, time and money if we haste [wd2,s-] impropely [fm1,-] .
I have some painful experiences on it [pr1,s-] .
Did [vp6,s-] you ever climb a hill?
But since I'm not strong enough, I am exhausted at merely the half [wd4,-2] the distance.
The result is that I am always the last one to get [wd4,-2] the summit.
That's [pr2,s-] the same in [wd3,3-] our study.
It's impossible for us to see a [np7,-1] English word and remember it at first sight.
Many people may think [vp1,-2] haste as a good thing.
But in fact, haste usually makes waste, as is different with their ideas [wd7,5-] .
Many people had wanted [vp6,-s-] to finish something quickly.
On account of it [pr1,s-] , they acts, but not as usual methods [wd5,5-] .
So they cut down some important materials, even which act key uses [wd7,3-] .
Things develop as [wd3,s-] their ruler [wd3,4-] .
But haste making waste damages this ruler [wd3,s-] .
So it is certant [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
Why, to finish a thing need [vp3,4-] some time to prepare, to do carefully.
If for less time, [wd7,3-] there would be somethings [fm2,-] neglected.
Because of the absence of these nessisary [fm1,-] things, the object won't be realized, and the other things we have done are waste [vp9,s-] .
In our study some students read the English words all day and all night in order to maste [fm1,-] the English in the least time.
they [fm1,-] [fm3,-] waste much time.
Because the English study doesn't only meant [vp9,2-] reading words, but grammar and others.
Furthermore, they don't [wd3,s-] remember too many words, for it is only in use that they can remember them.
that [fm3,-] is "Haste makes waste" also.
In my opinions [np3,2-] , haste usually makes waste.
Because, as to the subjective [wd3,-1] world, everything has its own principle of development.
They adherent [wd2,1-1] to the principles, which means we should pay good [cc4,-1] attention to the principles.
On the other hand, as far as man is concerned, haste sometimes leads to the nevious [fm1,-] state.
As [wd3,-3] my own experience, one day, when I was doing my housework, my friends called me to play football half an hour later.
In order to finish the job within thirty mintes [fm1,-] , I did the housework very quickly with little think [wd2,1-] .
At last, although I finished the work on time, I was criticed [fm1,-] by my teacher the next day.
If we will only pay more attention to the rules of things' development and be more carefully [wd2,1-] , we could get good results.
Second, If [fm3,-] you want to finish doing something quickly, you must be too nervous to work properly.
When these things happen, She [fm3,-] must do it again.
First, we always need some indispensible [fm1,-] preparations before we manage to finish a task.
It seems that these work [np3,1-] are unnecessary, but they are often essential for the success in the future.
On the other side, If [fm3,-] we want to reach our goal, we must follow the right instruction properly.
Sometime [wd3,s-] , even if you omit a minor step, the whole thing will fail and you have to start all over again from the very beginning.
In fact, it is a waste of time to finish work in a hurry and come out with [wd3,2-4] a bad outcome.
As a long [cc4,-1] saying, haste makes waste.
" On many occassions [fm1,-] , we may need to do things of our own time, [wd7,4-] but on [pp2,-2] the end, we may fail because we do them in a hurry.
What [pr5,s-] did this happen?
First, haste makes us impatient, and there are more chances that we do [wd3,-2] some mistakes.
Furthermore, haste to some extent causes [cc3,-2] more time, more energy and even more material.
In addition, the water must be added more and more [wd3,3-] .
In order to do it quicklier [fm2,-] , I at a blow [wd3,2-] added 500 ml water to the medicine, and then stir it quickly.
What it is [wd1,s-] now?
Even I stir so [wd3,s-] hard, still some medicine disolved [fm1,-] .
How [pr5,s-] can I do now?
This time I added the water by and by [wd7,2-] and I finished the experiment in the end.
When you are doing some research, when you are a real practicer [fm1,-] , please remember "haste makes waste".
"Haste makes Waste [fm3,-] " is a common idiom.
When you act against the principles, then [wd5,s-] , what you do can only bring you the opposit [fm1,-] result.
Although this idiom is known widely, people tend to haste [wd2,s-] spontaneously or unconsciously.
The reason [cc2,s-] may be the following two points.
Second, if you are [wd4,-1] hurry, you must be impatient.
And the difficulty will often can't [vp9,2-] be solved.
When he get [vp3,s-] to school, he found he had forgotten to take the homework which will be handed on [wd3,1-] .
Because he was too hurry [wd2,s-] to get the homework, he was late at last.
The saying tells us that before you want to do something successful [wd2,2-] , you won't [wd3,s-] do it in a hurry.
It's [pr2,s-] an old saying that: Haste makes waste.
No matter which country you are come [vp9,s-] from, you must be familiar with it.
So what make [vp3,1-] [vp1,2-5] peoples drew [vp4,2-] that conclution [fm1,-] ?
Imagine that you are struggling in the crowd of people, who are eager to registe [fm1,-] at the begining [fm1,-] of a term.
You'd filled the form as quickly as you could, and now you are [vp6,s-] at the head of a long line.
You have to go back and to [wd5,4-] wait for a [np7,-1] unbearable long time!
Then one of your classmate [np3,3-] , who are [vp3,s-] now at the head of the line, speaks to you with a big [cc4,-1] smile on his face: "Hi, haste makes waste!
Since when people are in a haste, they often can't think throughly [fm1,-] about the situation, so that's common for them to make a lot of mistakes.
Remember that old saying: Haste makes waste, and think twice before you make up your mind to do something, then you'll undoubtedly achieve more than you ever expected [vp6,s-] .
Sometimes old sayings can helps [vp9,1-] a lot.
 [wd4,-2] Comporatoary [fm1,-] days, efficience [fm1,-] plays essential role [np6,2-] in competitive cases [wd3,s-] , which people crazily persue [fm1,-] .
For one thing, unmature [fm2,-] proposition and uncorrect [fm2,-] assay will often be projected in haste.
 [wd7,s-] They should actually lead to a bad result; Secondly, haste uncertainly [wd3,s-] makes more product [np3,1-] or more profits, but [wd4,s-] waste.
High quality could makes [vp9,1-] more profits than great quantity.
A bankrupting [wd2,-3] of one enterprise can be exemplified as "Haste [fm3,-2] makes Waste".
It gets good reputation in social [wd2,1-] earilier [fm1,-] .
Its productive [wd2,1-] are all over the world.
For some reasons, producting [fm2,-] speed was improved to get more efficiences [fm1,-] .
Firstly, it [pr1,s-] takes more profit by it [pr1,s-] .
But, later, people find that most of it [pr4,-1] products were fake.
And it bankrupt [vp3,1-] [vp1,1-] !
In a world [wd3,2-] ,"Haste [fm3,-2] make [vp3,1-1] Waste".
As the proverb [cc2,-1] says "Haste Makes Waste".
If we have too big ambition and want to succeed in a short time, we'll fail in the end unless by [wd3,-3] a [np7,-2] evil way.
And we have to [cc3,2-4] be waste of time.
After some time, they not only make not [wd3,1-1] development, but also find the errors in homework increase even the speed of reading improves.
Some traffic accidents are also caused by the reason [wd3,s-] .
Drivers dive [wd3,s-] fast and have no time [wd4,2-1] avoid colliding when finding other vehicles come to them.
If we notice, we can find [cc3,-2] the proverb around us.
Everyone want [vp3,1-] to succeed in any position, but we should plan to accomplishment [wd2,2-] according to what we are really [wd7,5-] .
We should remember the proverb whatever we do [ad1,s-] , and use it in our daily life.
"Haste makes Waste [fm3,-] " is very reasonable scentence [fm1,-] .
If somebody wants to do something quickly, he thinks all about how to increase speed in his mind, so he is easily [wd2,2-1] to neglact [fm1,-] something important and useful that sometimes determine whether he can compelete [fm1,-] the thing successfully.
Therefore, he can not do the thing well and he must do it again, More time has been wasted insteads [fm2,-] of high speed.
But a few days after [wd3,3-] , they find those new words are still new words, we should study new words gradully [fm1,-] .
We learn a few words a day and after some time we have to review them again and several times we can crasp [fm1,-] them formly [fm1,-] .
Hast [fm1,-] makes waste.
For one thing, people do something which were [vp3,2-] not thought over often result in failures .
Because people want haster [fm2,-] , they must spend less time in preparing for nessisary [fm1,-] thing; for another thing, some difficutys [fm1,-] should be thought [cc3,3-] before people do a thing, yet, people persure [fm1,-] haste and forget these difficult [wd2,1-] , so, when they confronted them, they had no ideas.
Finally, something [cc2,s-] must have plent [fm1,-] of time to do.
Study is a case in point, learning knowledge is a long-run course [wd7,-] .
From primany [fm1,-] school to high school, and from high school to college, we have learned [cc3,-5] a great deal of knowledge which couldn't acquire [vp7,s-] in short time.
If you want [vp1,-1] become a college student in short terms [wd7,-] .
You must learn [cc3,-1] knowledge from begining [fm2,-] .
So haste makes waste, it is a truth for everything we want for ever [wd7,6-] .
There is an old saying:" Haste makes waste," It [cc2,s-] says that when you are doing something, you can't be in too much haste, or you will get an inexpective [fm2,-] result.
For example, many students want to pass the Band-six college English text [wd3,s-] , but in the text [wd3,s-] , they were so intensive [wd3,s-] that they forget [vp6,s-] many words what [pr5,s-] they had accumulated, they finished quickly but at once [wd3,1-] made a lot of mistakes.
The Culture Revolution gave our nation a lesson that Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
We didn't know step-by-step [wd2,1-] -- we were too eager to turn our ideal into reality, the result of which make our country fall back.
People often say," Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
On some occasions, though we want to get one thing done well and quickly, it turns out that we fail [vp1,-2] to it.
The hastilier [fm2,-] you get along with [cc3,2-2] a thing, the more waste time you will get.
 [wd7,s-] 
Because you can't make a full preperation [fm1,-] for the thing you are going to do in such a short time.
Therefor [fm2,-] , "Haste makes waste.
For instance, once when I was in an exam, I wanted to finish the paper quickly, so I did not hear what the teacher had told the student [np3,s-] .
Otherwise you will lose [wd3,s-] it.
In an old sayings [np3,2-] , that is "Haste makes waste".
 [wd7,s-] Since he was afraid, how could he do something well?
 [wd7,s-] Moreover, while one is haste [wd2,s-] , he may want to do something in another [wd3,1-1] ways.
Since he is haste [wd2,s-] to change his minds.
But if we want to pass it yet just prepare it hastely [fm2,-] , of course, we can't go over most of the books carefully.
As a result, we [cc2,s-] might be difficult to pass it.
After all, if we want to do anything success [wd2,2-] .
We mustn't be haste [wd2,s-] .
We must prepare it adquately [fm1,-] .
The success is base [vp9,3-4] on the many aspects, including time, hard work, means and so on.
When a child want [vp3,2-] to learn to run, he sould [fm1,-] first need time to practise walking.
He is permitted to right means [wd7,3-] to practise running.
So if you want to suceed [fm1,-] , you should not Haste [fm3,-] [wd2,s-] , because it makes waste.
The most [wd4,-1] waste is the waste of time.
In China, There is [wd4,1-2] old story implies [vp4,s-] the statement.
One of them made his knife [wd3,s-] sharper before cutting, so he cut wood quickly and efficiently.
And the other didn't do like that, no doubtly [fm2,-] , he spent much more time than the first one in cutting the wood.
In this story, we can easily conclude that Haste [fm3,-] really makes waste.
When we do something important at uncommon speed, people always tell us "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is an old-saying that means if we want to complete something successfully, we should do it careful [wd2,2-] rather than do it so fast without any care, or it may waste your time.
 [wd7,s-] For instant [wd2,1-] , while a student attends a [np7,-1] exam, finishing test paper very quickly often results in worse [cc4,-1] marks.
Those all opposites [wd3,s-] to "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
It [fm1,-] a word, though time is very precious, we should well-spend [fm2,-] it to do important things because of "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
A proverb says "Haste makes waste", which means some people often make things more terrible [wd7,3-] than they expected before because of their haste.
Everything has its own process consisted of many steps, we cann't [fm2,-] leave out some steps which seem to be less important only want to finish it more quickly.
Haste usually bring [vp3,2-] about a failure.
For example, when a teacher modifies the [np7,s-] exam, a student doesn't listen carefully while does his paper, finally he gets the wrong answer only because of his intention of finishing the paper as fast as he can.
In fact, spending such a few minute on teacher's words doesn't affect the fulfill [wd2,1-] of the exam.
And in our normal [wd3,s-] life, there are many instances.
that [fm3,-] haste makes waste.
We should make [cc3,-3] a full consideration when we prepare to do a thing.
We often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
If we do a business too hastly [fm1,-] , without considering fulling [fm1,-] , we can not find the best way to do it.
So we say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
For example, when we learn English, we should remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
When we are learners, we should learn the simple words firstly [wd2,4-] .
If we cross over [cc3,1-3] the simple words and read the complex texts, we must find great difficulty reading it [pr3,s-] and losed [fm2,-] interest, then we can't master English forever!
Sometimes, people want to finish works or get to [cc3,1-1] achievement [wd4,s-] doing a short period, but every problem need [vp3,2-] resolving regularly, and you must do orderly and carefully.
Some people want to hurry, he often doesn't know what to do first and also do a lot of things in a time, [wd7,s-] so, he maybe [wd3,1-1] careless and subtle [wd7,-] of what he has done and what is to be done, as a result, come to false .
I remember when I was a high school student of greet [wd3,5-1] two, find [vp6,s-] test [np6,1-1] was coming but I [wd4,1-1] still indulged in playing, I thought, I was clever, and two days before the test was enough to me.
When the "two days" come [vp6,s-] , there were some [wd3,-2] many things to read, I read here a little there a little [wd3,5-] , but remember nothing, so, finally, I didn't pass.
An old saying goes [wd4,s-] that "Haste makes Waste [fm3,2-] ".
It means when you haste [wd2,s-] in doing something, you'll probably miss your goal.
If you want to cut across, then you will leave this or that detail that has important effect on the whole thing but you're unconcious [fm1,-] Such omitting [wd2,1-] may lead to your failure.
The following example is just what I experienced now [wd3,s-] .
I'm always afraid of compisition [fm1,-] writing, its time limit is so short-30 minutes.
There's no time for drawing a draft, so there're so many corrected [wd3,s-] places in the paper.
As to the example, I have thought for a full ten minute which example is comherent [fm1,-] to the subject.
At first I was in a hurry for a quick comprisition, [fm1,-] but now I can only squeeze through it.
Now I've attained a thorough comprehesion [fm1,-] of the saying "Haste makes waste".
The development of a certain thing needs a certain period of time to [cc2,s-] conduct [cc3,-3] the certain procedure.
If we don't proceed along [wd3,-2] the procedure for saving time, the thing will be spoiled.
One old story [cc2,s-] says the following.
If we haste [wd2,s-] , the food will possibly come out to be burnt or still raw.
In one [pp2,1-1] word, we must make the best use of time, but not to waste [wd4,s-] .
If you finish your work or study in a hurry, you won't achieve a satisfied [wd2,-1] consequent.
You must have a plan several months, two or three day [np3,1-] , or no more than several seconds, before you decide to accomplish your work.
For example, a man plan [vp3,2-] to product [wd2,2-] a small store of his own.
If he performs his plan in a hurry without consideration, he might be failure [wd2,3-] in a short time.
" But if he goes to [cc3,1-1] [cc3,1-2] plan well, he will succeed.
When one wants something to be done more quickly, he tends to using [vp5,2-] less time.
During the procession [wd3,s-] he may get lost and performs [vp1,-1] wrong.
Everything [cc2,-4] has its own way to be carried out.
In order to get what we want, we must do it orderly and paiently [fm1,-] .
For example in order to win a chempion [fm1,-] in a sports meeting, one exercises every day before the meeting.
However, some [wd3,s-] day before the meeting he got sick for [wd3,-3] his over done [wd3,1-] .
We must know that the [wd5,-1] Rome isn't established [wd3,2-] in one day.
A [np7,-2] old saying goes [vp1,-4] "More haste, less speed".
When we do many a thing especially more important [wd4,s-] , we try our best to apply [wd7,-1] it [pr3,s-] as fast as possible.
But we [cc2,-3] are so obvious that sometimes we can fail in the end.
A man who have [vp3,3-] achieve [vp9,1-] much success must be patient and takes steps when their causes are under way.
Many people when they work are often easily dispointed [fm1,-] and stop halfway, For example my friend Li Hai is such a man.
Usually he attempts a lot of things, but seldom [ad1,-2] he can acquint [fm1,-] the good result.
Many attempts failed, but he held to his purpose with firmness and finally success [wd2,s-] in over throwing [fm2,1-] the Qin [fm1,-] Dynasty.
Thereby when we do something use should take steps and establish a schiedule [fm1,-] primarily and according to the plan go on it.
Otherwise not only can [wd1,s-] we not attain our aims but also we may lost [vp9,1-] our couragement [fm1,-] .
We always wish [vp1,-1] finish our tasks quickly.
Sometime [wd3,s-] , something [cc2,-4] wants to be done step by step.
Thing [np6,-s] is done after another things have been finished.
 [wd7,s-] Wanting to get to [cc3,1-1] aim [np6,s-] , we sould [fm1,-] do it step by step.
We wish we are able to write conversition [fm1,-] .
First, we must be able to write words and grasp grammer [fm1,-] .
Furthermore, we must read, write and practise [cc3,-1] quantity.
When, these are done, we must learned [vp9,1-] [vp1,-1] thinking.
Using our brains, observing things around us, we must to [vp9,1-] be able to write conversition [fm1,-] excellently.
If our words is too poor and our grammer [fm1,-] is very mess [wd2,2-] , we must [wd3,s-] not write conversition [fm1,-] .
Perhaps it means that when one wants to do something in a hurry, he often fails to do it, at the same time, he waste [vp3,1-] his time.
The easiest example may be our study in [pp2,-1] school.
As we sit at the desk, we can't pay attention to the text, or we can't remember what is said in page [np6,1-] at all.
People often say: "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste.
This word contains several kinds of meaning [np3,2-] .
One [wd3,s-] , when you do something hastily, your rediation [fm1,-] isn't full.
When you need something, you can't find and remember them [pr3,s-] .
You will found [vp9,1-] the only way [wd7s-s-] , which is giving it up.
 [wd7,s-] Another is that you can't haste [wd2,s-] when you do something.
If you don't act this way, you will make mistake [np6,1-] .
Haste Make [vp3,1-] [fm3,1-1] waste.
when [fm3,-] solve problems, we should act as this word [wd7,3-] : Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
It means that you want [vp1,-1] do something quickly, but it always make [vp3,2-] [vp1,-5] you can't do it perfectly, and even make things worse.
" Now, First [fm3,-] , when you are [wd5,1-1] hasten, you won't do work careful [wd2,2-] and prcisly [fm1,-] , and you will make more undetected mistake [np3,2-] in you [pr4,-1] work, for example when you are reading a book, if you are [wd5,1-1] hurry [vp1,-2] about it, you will overlook many important points, and it is so much so [wd5,s-] that you can't catch on immediatly [fm1,-] then you are wasting time virtually.
Second, the more you want to minius [fm1,-] the time you work the more you must keep up with your think [wd2,1-] , and then you must digest the more unfamliar [fm1,-] thing [wd7,2-] , and it will make you confused.
Therefor [fm1,-] when you [wd4,s-] do a thing better you shouldn't "haste" [wd2,s-] and then you will probably do it successfully.
"Haste makes waste" is the [np7,s-] famous saying.
It [wd3,-3] is to say, the more you will [wd5,s-] want, the less you will get.
When you do something, if you are hasted [fm2,-] , you can't do it carefully, there are [vp3,1-s] much detail you will omit and there are much [np8,-1] errors you will make.
When the thing is finished, the end is worse than you want [wd3,s-] .
 [wd7,s-] 
There are many example [np3,1-] .
As far as study [wd2,-1] English is concerned, it [pr1,s-] is a case in point.
It is well known, [wd4,s-] the English study is a slow course.
To rember [fm1,-] the new words, you shold [fm1,-] remeber [fm1,-] [cc5,-4] it again and again, and you should remeber [fm1,-] the words not too much you want to rember [fm1,-] the news [wd2,-1] words a hundred one day, [wd7,s-] tomorrow you will forget 99 of them.
Let us rember [fm1,-] the saying "Haste makes waste", to do every thing carefully and slowly.
It means one always can't realize [cc3,-2] his purpose if he does it [pr1,s-] in a hurry.
Why does [wd3,s-] it so?
There are some reason [np3,2-] .
When one want [vp3,1-] to finish something quickly he tends to do it in a hurry.
He can't consider all the aspects of it and it probably draw [vp3,2-] back the proceeding [wd3,3-] .
Another is that one in a hurry can't do well and, it maybe postpone [vp3,2-] the achievements.
There is an example that can vertify [fm1,-] the truth of "Haste makes waste" well.
A person wants to meet [wd3,s-] the train as quickly as he can.
He hurrys [fm2,-] out and gets to the station 15 miniturs [fm1,-] earlier.
Suddenly he finds he forget [vp3,1-] to take the suicase [fm1,-] that he must use.
Doesn't it tell us that he didn't do it [pr1,s-] ?
For example, if you are doing your homework, Mother told [vp6,s-] you [wd4,s-] should finish your homework, and then you should [wd3,s-] go to play with your friends.
I should haven't [vp9,1-] made these mistakes.
People can't do anything perfectly in eagerness [wd4,s-] even in anxiety.
Psyologists [fm1,-] also suggest eagerness don't [vp3,1-] mean good lucky [wd2,1-] .
Because we can do everything better without the psyological [fm1,-] pressure.
In the history of socience [fm1,-] , many famous scientists discovered or invented scientific equation or something use [wd2,1-] .
Haste makes waste, calmness makes use [wd7,2-] .
You know the things devolop [fm1,-] graduatedly [fm1,-] .
Haste can let the things run away [wd4,1-3] the usual route.
Not only can't obtain the gaol [fm1,-] .
But also bring the opposit [fm1,-] effect sometimes.
We can't change the normal rule of the nature, [wd4,s-] can't do our works unconsidering [fm2,-] the fact.
only [fm3,-] can you succeed obeying the natural's development regular [wd2,s-] .
We can say haste makes waste the following is some exampls [fm1,-] .
As a student [np3,-s] , we all have the experiment [wd3,s-] that, we study the lesson must have the spirit of graduatedly [fm1,-] , some student [np3,1-] have not the firm basement [wd3,s-] .
But they want to study the course beyond his [pr3,s-] level, as a result, his [pr3,s-] geting [fm1,-] can't compare [vp7,-1] with his [pr3,s-] lost [wd2,1-] .
Another [wd3,s-] , when we exercise our body farthermore [fm1,-] , we must obey the rule.
It often [ad1,-2] can be seen that someone is too eager to do things ahead [wd3,s-] , but they fail in the end.
There are some reason [np3,2-] .
Above all [wd4,s-] is that most of them haven't prepared well for their work.
Then when they meet some problem [np3,1-] , they don't know how to do.
The [wd5,s-] third, Most [fm3,-] of the works need great patient [wd2,1-] .
If you want to haste [wd2,2-] , the chance of succeed [wd2,1-] will go.
So from [wd4,-1] above, we can see that haste makes waste.
To the peasents [fm1,-] , haste may be bad for their harvest.
As for workers, if they proceed [cc3,-2] the production too fast, the production [wd2,-3] with bad quality would come out.
As students, we should haste [wd2,1-] in our study.
So we mustn't haste [wd2,1-] when we do anything.
But it is not equal to that we can slow down our speed because of lazy [wd2,1-] or other reasons.
We need to do well prepare [wd2,2-] and want for [wd5,s-] the chance.
When the chance comes, we shall work with patient [wd2,1-] .
The Chinese idiom, haste makes waste, means that the willing [wd2,1-] to save time often results in a waste of time.
It orginates [fm1,-] from an old story.
Firstly he rided [fm2,-] a horse and kept spuring [fm1,-] it in order to get [wd4,s-] earlier.
But he was so anxious that he thought the horse run too slow [wd2,2-] .
Then he jumped down from the horse back [fm2,1-] and walked on foot.
From this story we know: uder [fm1,-] some emergent circumstances in order to save time we easily become anxious and lose our sensiability [fm2,-] , we forget so many convention [np3,2-] that we can't give [wd3,-3] a right decision.
Haste makes us anxious and anxious [wd2,1-1] makes us unsensitible [fm2,-] which leads to a waste in the end.
We must keep a calm head [wd3,3-] under any circumstance.
Please rember [fm1,-] "Haste makes waste".
As we known [vp4,2-] , hurry comes along with haste.
 [wd7,s-] When you want to finish a thing as quickly as possible, you have little time to think over [vp1,1-3] how to do it efficiently, [wd4,s-] how to make full use of materials.
What's more, haste makes you nervous, then all the things will [wd4,-2] in a mess and you can hardly decide how to go on.
In conclusion, we must know: Firstly, haster [fm2,-] makes waste of money and meterials [fm1,-] .
Second, haster [fm2,-] wastes your time, maybe you have to start again in a hurry.
Haster [fm2,-] always block [vp3,2-] you up.
The waster [wd2,1-1] made by haster [fm2,-] is easy to see.
I can make [wd3,-3] some examples from myself.
I try [vp6,s-] my best to work as quickly as possible as to cut all its parts out from the template [wd7,s-] , then they are lying in front of me in a mess and I really do not know which one should I pick up firstly and how to begin!
I waste [vp6,s-] all my time [wd4,-2] the day!
It's quitely [fm2,-] confirm [vp9,2-] the old saying: "Haste makes waste.
Sometimes, we are benifited [fm1,-] by it, but most of times [np5,s-] , we fail and have to waste more time to start from the beginning again.
So what we can do is just to follow the order [wd7,2-] .
As we all knows [np3,3-] , a man will be hurt on his [wd3,2-1] mouth if he is too eager to drinking [vp5,3-] the boiling water.
How does [vp3,-1] we obey this priciple [fm1,-] ?
In our ordinary lives, we must grasp some scient [fm1,-] knowledges [np5,-] and then use them.
However, we must [vp9,-2] to work to make our lives more facilited [fm2,-] with more efficient way.
In this case, he does everything discarefully [fm2,-] , so that he would lose this or forget that.
It is Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
But, it [pr1,s-] is the simple meaning, there is still further meaning in our lives.
You may get it in [wd3,2-3] my following example.
They each wanted to get out as quick [wd2,3-] as possible, and no one wanted to die.
So many people get [vp6,-s-] to the gate at the same time that they were stucked [fm2,-] in it and no one got out.
But suppose, [wd3,s-] one person stand out to make order.
Everyone standed [fm2,-] in line, may-be no one would [vp8,s-] die.
I think, it [wd4,1-1] important for us to keep calm in this [pr1,s-] case.
This words [np3,1-] indicates that if you want to do something in a hurry, finish it earlier than before, you will get nothing at last.
For example, when I was 15-year-old [aj5,3-] , I was fond of football.
At a [wd3,s-] time, several friends asked me to play football when I was helping my mother to have [wd3,3-2] a cooking.
In order to play football as soon as I can, I hurried to wear my shoe and let the fire burning [vp5,3-] [cc5,-1] larger.
But some minutes later, I [cc2,-4] smelt of nasty [cc4,-1] gas.
So as you can see, when we do anything, we should do it slowly, not hurrily [fm2,-] .
Otherwise we could not get the consequence [wd3,s-] that we expect.
So why we don't [wd1,s-] do it at leisure?
Haste make [vp3,1-] waste, because you haven't prepaired [fm1,-] everything you must have done.
It's [wd7,s-s-] ] the foundation.
When we start to do something, firstly we should do something [wd7,4-] : make a good plan, find something we need to use, and some people if we can't do it without their help, and so on.
When all is running [wd3,s-] , we just do it.
A [np7,-1] excession [fm1,-] is needed.
 [wd7,s-] But there are many difficulties.
For example, a girl is fat and she want [vp3,1-] to be thinner and more beautiful.
Haste [wd2,s-] ?
She may get [wd3,-2] on diet or even eat nothing except water.
 [wd7,s-] Otherwise it will be out of order.
At the same time she need [vp3,1-] phsical [fm1,-] training.
In all [pp2,-] , haste make [vp3,1-] waste.
Walking on the ground, [wd7,s-] we'll reach the success.
It is true that Haste [fm3,-] makes waste.
They try their best but get zero in test [np6,1-] .
In society, we can see the people who are eager to find a cut-cross [wd3,s-] to great wealth in spite of the precept of "no pay, no gains [np2,3-] ".
Such people is [vp3,1-] so dangerous that they can finally commit any crime to attain their goal.
Here we see the fact that Haste [fm3,-] not only makes waste but also makes disasterous [fm1,-] damages to society.
It only lead [vp3,2-] [vp1,-2] to fall.
When we devolop [fm1,-] our country, we shall do it step by step.
There's a lesson [np1,s-] in history [np6,1-] that we tried to be too fast to devolop [fm1,-] our society.
Whenever and wherever [wd4,-s-] we shall remember it [pr2,-s-] : haste makes waste.
Because anything has its style [wd7,3-] , once we break the style, we will can't succees [fm1,-] .
When we read book [np6,1-] , we want to learn more and more information,but there is a limit in our mind, the information reach [vp3,2-] [vp1,-3] to the limit, our mind will can't [vp9,1-] receive new information.
If you force youself [fm1,-] to receive new information again, you will make all of the information [cc2,1-2] give off from your mind.
 [wd7,s-] 
Long, long ago, a man want [vp3,2-] to make a tree grow more fast [ad3,1-] , he drow [fm1,-] the tree to help it [pr1,s-] , but the tree "dies" .
Because he didn't know the tree growed [fm2,-] according to its style [wd7,3-] , he couldn't help it, at last he made the tree "die".
At [wd7,-s-] every doing live [wd2,3-] , there are a lot of example [np3,3-] , haste makes waste, we must warn of it.
After it is created, it develops step by step, and then reachs [fm1,-] the end.
Maybe, we make a good beginning, but we also think [vp1,-4] "be quick, be quick", so we became hasty and impatient, we forget the steps, we want to swallow an elephant at one time.
Thus we are doomed to be [wd5,s-] fail.
Father always tells me,"Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
A hasty men [np3,2-] wanted his crop grow sooner [wd3,4-] , so he pulled them up.
Now [wd3,s-] , it seemed that the crop grew much taller, but the next day, they all died.
Chinese people usually say, "Hasty man can not eat up a hot beancurd [fm1,-] .
Haste makes Waste [fm3,-] .
That is to say: Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
Emphasizing anyone [wd3,s-] and ignoring the other will be haste makes waste.
"Haste make [vp3,1-1] waste" tell [vp3,3-] us how to deal with [cc3,1-6] the situation and our wills.
Only when what we are thing [fm1,-] about met the situation's quest [wd3,s-] , Our [fm3,-] wish can [wd1,s-] come into true.
If we disobey the regulation, we'll never succees [fm1,-] .
That's "Haste [fm3,-] makes waste".
For example, when we learn English, all of us want make [vp4,1-] a quick [wd4,s-] .
But sometime [wd3,s-] , we learn a lot as much as other people learn, [wd4,s-] it's ineffective.
Because it is the case in overwhelming majority [wd4,-1] situations.
With the development of the mordern [fm1,-] society, the tempo of our life become quicker and quicker, so we pay much attention to speed.
Even at times haste make [vp3,1-] waste.
For example, this idiom is very fitted [wd2,2-1] for our study.
otherwise [fm3,-] , we can't reach the rich storehouse of the knowledge.
Beside forgoing [wd3,s-] , it can also be fitted [wd2,1-] for most of the aspects of our daily life.
Since then, [wd3,1-] we must make sense of the idiom "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" and bring [wd3,-4] it in our minds when we do something, especially important things.
Only by this, we can [wd1,s-] reach our purposes successfully.
What "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" means is that we won't succeed in anything [wd4,s-] we want to finish it too quickly.
The reason is that when we try to finish something too quickly, always [ad1,-2] we will not make the preparations which are necessarily needed, or not do it step by step, just to save the time.
And [wd5,s-] obviously the preparations and doing it step by step is all those that will lead to the success.
If we want to develope [fm1,-3] [cc3,-] our English degree, we can not hope to succeed in a shorp [fm1,-] period of time.
Because to develope [fm1,-] [cc3,-2] English degree is to have a large number of work for us to do.
We must add [wd3,-2] our vocabulary; we must do reading excises to improve our reading skill; we must make clear of [wd5,s-] all kinds of gramme [fm1,-] .
It's easy to see that if we want to finish these in a short time, however hard we worked [vp6,s-] , it would still be impossible for us to turn our will [wd3,2-2] into fact.
Chinese has a [np7,-1] old saying: Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste.
Because people think that whateven [fm1,-] we want to do, we must prepare it consvertinely [fm1,-] .
We might as well complete it by acting on its princepel [fm1,-] .
If we work without considering everything that we must [wd4,1-1] aware of we probably will come to falling down [wd7,3-] .
 [wd7,s-] 
We wanna [fm1,-] complete it very soon, so we prepare the food very simply and cook them very hastely [fm2,-] .
We will most probably forget to drep [fm1,-] something else which must add [vp7,4-] up [wd5,1-2] to the food.
And we will probably cut short the time that we're cooking [vp6,s-] .
So, we must remmber [fm1,-] : Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste, We have [vp2,-3] better do everything by acting on its princepel [fm1,-] .
It is well known for us [wd5,1-] that "Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste".
Sometimes we want to get to someplace on time in a limited time, we are so hurry [wd2,2-] and anxious that [wd4,s-] forget to bring some important things with us.
When we get [wd4,-2] the destination we just find that we forget [vp6,s-] to bring the things we need.
For instance, you hurried into the classroom to attend an important exam, Perhaps you feel lucky that you use the shortest time from home or dormitory to the classroom and [wd4,s-] just before the exam begin.
But suddenly you find you forgot to bring your permission of examnation [fm1,-] .
Sometimes we want to get high score in the final exam and before the exam we worked [vp6,s-] very hard without thinking of our healthy [wd2,2-] .
When the date of exam come [vp3,4-] , we are so tired that we have no spirt [fm1,-] to do the problems.
Even [wd3,-1] worse, sometime [wd3,s-] we fail to attend the exam because we are ill caused by tired [wd2,1-] .
We never forget that in our recent history there was Great Promotion [wd3,1-] .
Perhaps the thought of progress [vp4,1-1] quickly is good, but we also should think about the envirenment [fm1,-] and capability, as well as other elements.
If we only seek the goal while [wd3,s-] ignore the very [ad2,-1] elements in process, we just put ourselves into such result [wd7,4-] -- Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste.
Sometimes we say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
Haste means acting quickly and waste means having [wd3,-2] no good, uselessness.
So how to comprehensive "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"?
It just tells us that whatever we do, we should comply with the inherent principles of the matter and not go beyond even break the rules, or you will get nothing but the waste of time, metiral [fm1,-] or [wd5,1-1] etc.
For instance, a certain man want [vp3,3-] to buy a pair of shoes, some books and he also wants to repair his bike and then he want the [fm1,-] go fishing.
If he does arrange them in order, first to buy the book, then goes along street [np6,1-] to buy the shoes, then returns home for the fishing tools and the goes out for finishing, how could be [fm1,s-] manage all the three things together?
He will undoutably [fm1,-] does [vp9,2-] nothing that [wd5,s-] but [wd4,s-] busy going here and there.
Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste is a Chinese old saying.
First, if you are hasteful [fm2,-] to do something, you can't think it over and over.
Second, during the course of doing everything you might lose patience if you are hasteful [fm2,-] .
Finally, everything has its own rythmn [fm1,-] of development.
If you are hasteful [fm2,-] you'll break its rythmn [fm1,-] and make waste.
For example, in ancient China there was a peasant who owed [wd3,s-] a piece of field.
He was so hasteful [fm2,-] that he wanted his crops to grow quickly, so one day he went to the field and pulled all of his crops to make them seen [wd3,2-1] taller.
From this example we can see "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" this chinese [fm3,-] old saying .
Many people haven't paient [fm1,-] , they want to succeed immeditaly [fm1,-] .
Wehether [fm1,-] we work or study, we must have paient [fm1,-] .
Because, above all, we have to prepare everything well before we start, we must study it carefully, schelude [fm1,-] the process, and then, do it step by step.
 [wd7,s-] 
One year before I dicided [fm1,-] to attend [wd4,s-] English corner, to improve my English level.
I thought that only if I attend [vp6,s-] , I would have what I wanted.
But in fact, I couldn't hear [wd3,s-] and say anything in the corner.
As a result, I wasted much time in [wd4,s-] English corner, but gained nothing.
He adviced [wd2,1-] [vp1,-2] me prepare before going to [wd4,s-] English corner, speak and listen more in everyday life, improve English level little by little.
And now, I can speak and listen freely in [wd4,s-] English corner.
If you want to succeed, "step by step" is the best way you should obey [cc3,s-] .
People often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste!
There are several reason [np3,2-] on [wd3,1-1] it.
First, when one wants to do something quickly, he can't think it over and arrange [vp1,-3] how to do it well.
So when he does it, he doesn't know what's the best means and how to do it effectiently [fm1,-] .
As a result, the faster he wants to do something, the worst [ad3,s-] the result is.
For instaince [fm1,-] , my uncle is a man who likes to do anything quickly.
One time [wd3,1-] , he wanted to chang [fm1,-] the windows' glass in his house.
But he didn't accept the advise [wd2,1-] .
Once he wanted to let a bottle of beer cool quickly so he put it into the refertior [fm1,-] .
After several minutes, the bottle broke and the refert [fm1,-] ... was useless too.
In a word, we do something we must think it over and do it careful [wd2,2-] .
So he or she often take [vp3,-3] some methords [fm1,-] or measures without thinking carefully and completely.
As a result, they don't realize their object or gain what they want to have, even [wd4,s-] go to the opposite direction.
For example, when we are studying at school, we want to gain a best score at [wd3,-1] test, so we often think [cc3,-3] some quick way to receive it.
Sometimes we will find some books, which we think of [wd5,s-] are avaibbe [fm1,-] to the tests, and read them more and more [wd3,2-1] carefully to hope we will guess the key of the questions on [wd3,-2] the test, and give up the basic knowledge which the teacher teaches us every day.
But at last we fall [wd3,s-] because we are too haste [wd2,2-] to sucess [fm1,-] .
To avoide [fm1,-] the shortcoming, we should try our best to make our doing more efficient [wd7,4-] .
Here is an example, if we want to get [wd4,-2] some place in an unfamiliar city, what should we do first?
On the other hand, in our daily life, we should do everything from the start [wd2,1-1] point, and do it step by step.
When we want to do something, good prepairation [fm1,-] is necessary.
What you have done is meaningles [fm1,-] .
So, it is wise to sharpen your knife [wd3,s-] first, then use it to cut the wood.
It means people sometimes disire [fm1,-] to do thing [np6,s-] quickly but finally find that it takes much more time than [wd4,s-] expected.
I think there are main reasons as [wd4,-1] following: Firstly, when people want to finish their work as soon as they can, they always ignore some details of the work.
When they start working, what was [vp6,s-] not expected happens, and they will not be able to solve the problem smoothly.
You do not eat your breakfirst [fm1,-] at table but take it to your car.
We all say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
but [fm3,-] why?
But we must remember, whatever we do, we must do [vp1,2-3] step by step.
If you don't lay a good basis and do [vp1,s-3] step by step, you won't aim [cc3,-2] your goal.
So if you only want to be haste [wd2,1-] in your work, you will fail in the end.
So we say "Haste Makes Waste [fm3,2-] ".
Take [wd4,-2] for example.
It will take you years before you are good [aj1,-1] it.
You must remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" in study.
When we do things, we should take it in sequence [wd7,3-] .
Why do peploe [fm1,-] say that haste makes waste?
First, when we are in haste, we can't keep clam [fm1,-] and think carefully.
Second, everything has its own turn [wd7,4-] , we can not change it.
We can understand the saying from many relastic [fm1,-] examples.
If you want to make yourself strength [wd2,2] , you should do exercises often, have rest and eat well.
The importance of it [pr1,s-] is that you should keep it [pr1,s-] constantly.
Educate [vp4,s-] a person is the same principle.
The change of a person's though [fm1,-] has a process.
In one [pp2,1-1] word, we should take things at [pp2,-1] turn.
We think we could have time enough [wd1,2-] .
And when we correct the wrong [wd3,s-] , we spend more time on it than we do the thing a time [wd3,1-] .
One morning, when we would [wd4,-1] exam, I got up early and had breakfast quickly because I wanted to go to school earlier.
When I hurried [vp1,-2] out home, my mother told me to look through my bag and see whether [wd4,-2] left something.
But I hurried out [ad2,2-] and didn't do it.
Taking the pencil I hurried out [ad2,2-] again.
After I want [wd3,s-] home and told mother [np6,1-] the thing, mother [np6,1-] said haste makes waste.
It seems [wd4,s-] a very simple question.
To finish it in a short time, we have no time to examine the procedure, so always [ad1,-2] we fall [wd3,s-] .
Here is an example about "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
The [fm1,-] are very eager to find a way that they can master this language quickly.
They may do a lot of exercises in one perial [fm1,-] .
And when they have lost insterst [fm1,-] in studying English the [fm1,-] push it aside.
When they are asked [wd4,s-] , they will say that it is difficult to study English.
But, they should know, anybody who learn [vp3,2-] English well depends on a kind of permenant [fm1,-] spirit.
And it is the reason that finally lead [vp3,s-] to their success.
So if you want to master a language, you should never make this [pr1,s-] mistake: Haste Maskes [fm1,-] Waste.
This example embodies the saying, Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
I think you will answer the question on [pp2,-3] the head of the article.
 [wd7,s-] It's known to all that we can not count the chickens before [wd4,s-] hatched.
Some person [np3,1-] have not realized this theory.
They hurried [vp1,-2] in doing something in order to finish it as early as possible, without preparing [vp1,-4] with the basic requestions [fm1,-] .
Even [wd3,-1] worse, it will be made in a mess.
Say , that is "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
For an [wd4,1-1] example, when you were driving a car, you drove it so fast that you can [vp6,s-] get home quickly.
There's a traffic-lights [fm2,1-] [np3,1-] ahead.
Surely, you could drive the car across the crossing without stopping through [fm1,-] the light was red.
Then the police would stop you, or sometimes you would catch an accident unluckly [fm1,-] .
If every driver has the same opinion with [wd3,3-] yours, the city must be out of controll [fm1,-] .
So "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
Don't be aimless, you should do it step by step while you were [vp6,s-] doing something.
Haste makes waste is a [np7,-1] acient [fm1,-] idiom.
It is summary [np6,s-] of people's long experience.
Everything has its specially [wd2,-1] characteristic, according to [wd3,1-] it, you would get benefits from it, but if you exceed [wd3,s-] it, it would get badly to you [wd7,3-] , it would keep back your processor [wd3,3-] , so said haste makes waste .
Such as [wd3,s-] , when you have a chemistry experience [wd3,1-] , you should heat the tube slowly, if you heat the tube quickly, the tube's temperature raise quickly, it would crash, so you have to try another tube, so you finish the experience [wd3,2-] slowly.
We should learn to not [wd1,2-] haste [wd2,3-] , not to waste us [pr4,1-1] time.
Haste makes waste means we do things in a hurry for saving time, but in the end the result is not so satisfied [wd2,3-] .
Because when we finished [vp6,s-] a job in a hurry we [wd4,s-] often not so careful, not so accurate.
Therefore, we may easily do some thing wrong [wd2,4-] with it [wd5,s-] .
So we have to do it again or to do some repair [wd3,s-] work.
This idiom is widely uses [vp9,2-] in many aspects.
Usually it is used to tell someone to do things carefully don't think too much of the time, to do it well is better than [wd4,s-] do it again.
I have an example for this thing [wd5,s-] .
One day I wanted to get a good place in the classroom, because that night's lecture is [vp6,s-] very interesting, and the classroom is alway [fm1,-] harshed [fm2,-] .
So I picked up all the necessaries of the class and without checking [vp1,s-] up.
When I quickly passed the campus and finially [fm1,-] got a good seat I was very please [vp9,2-] about it.
But as soon as the teacher beggan [fm1,-] to speak, I suddenly found out that the text book was left [wd4,s-] .
So the whole night, I have [vp3,s-] to share the book with another classmate, and it really disturbed her, I feeled [fm2,-] regret [wd2,1-] but I have no choice.
There is a story about Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
Long long age [fm1,-] , a man wanted to go to the county, but the county door would be closed soon, and he have [vp6,s-] [vp3,1-] many books banded with rop [fm1,-] .
So he ask [vp6,s-] a man in [wd3,2-2] the way "Can I go into the county today?
" The man look [vp6,s-] up [wd4,2-1] him and said 'If you walk slowly, you can.
' The travier [fm1,-] was very happy, and he wanted to go into the county fastly [fm2,-] , so he walked fastly [fm2,-] .
But near the door [wd3,s-] the rop [fm1,-] broke, and the man had to stop to do [wd3,-3] with his books, when he finished doing [wd3,-2] with books, he found the door had be [vp9,1-1] closed.
This mean [vp3,1-] that if we want to do something, we shall do it [fm1,-] turn, if we want to do it fastly [fm1,-] and not in turn then will haste makes waste .
For example, some drivers wanted to go home early, so they drove fastly [fm2,-] , speeching [fm1,-] then a [np7,-1] accident happened, the drivers were injured, so they could not go home early, but waste [vp6,s-] many [np8,-1] time in hosplts [fm1,-] or he never come [vp3,2-] home again.
Why is [wd4,s-] the case?
Most things we do in our daily life proves [vp3,s-] the saying right.
But without a well organized constructure [fm2,-] , the students especially beginners aren't able to write a precise, coherent composition.
So remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
With the developing [wd3,-] of the economic [wd2,1-] , the social commodities [cc4,1-] become richer and richer, [cc2,s-] but, at the same time, some person and factory [np3,3-] made [vp6,s-] fake commodities in order to obtain much money .
these [fm3,-] fake commodities bring much trouble to thousands and millions of people.
For example: fake medicine, if a patient uses [cc3,-3] the fake medicine, he is not being healthy in time, however, he maybe have [vp3,2-] been done harm by this medicine .
If you want to built [vp5,1-] a big building, the fake material will make the building dangerous to mans' [fm2,-] life.
How can we prevent these thing [np3,1-] from taking place?
I think, at first the factory which produce [vp3,s-] the good commodities [cc4,1-] should actively protect [cc3,-4] the advantage of themselves, then we can call on all the person [np3,2-] to object [wd2,s-] to use [wd2,3-] the fake commodities, the the [wd6,1-] fake commodities can not occupy the market .
On the other hand we should educate the people and let them know the behavior that make [vp3,3-] [vp1,1-4] fake commodities does not permit [vp7,s-] by the law.
At last, we should take advantage of the law [cc3,4-] .
The life of people is seriously affected [cc2,5-] .
For example, someone sold wines made from [wd3,1-] industrious [cc4,-1] alcohol, and it caused many people to be blind, even to be dead.
Furthermore, fake commodities affect the flourish [wd2,-] of the economy.
Many factories that produce good [cc4,-1] commodites [fm1,-] are at a disadvantage because of their high price.
Firstly we should establish a good [cc4,-1] system of law.
Secondly, as a citzen [fm1,-] of the country, we shouldn't buy fake commdites [fm1,-] .
Fake commodities may be cheaper than good [cc4,-1] commodities but their quality is very poor.
I think, if we all don't buy fake commodities, then in [wd5,-] some day, fake commodities will diappear [fm1,-] in the market.

So we must prevent fake commodities from producing [vp7,s-] and being sold .
The department which is in charge of business should improve the strength on striking producing fake commodities [cc3,3-] .

At [pp2,-1] all, zhong [fm3,-] shan [fm2,-] Univerdity gave you a more comfortable feeling than GUFL did.
No doubt, Zhong shan [fm2,-] University enjoys much greater fame than GUFL does.
It's one of the most famous universities in south China, even a foreign [wd2,1-2] knows it and shows great interest when mentioning it.
some [fm3,-] people in Guang zhou [fm2,-] haven't heard of the name of GUFL before and some know, but they don't know where to find it.
On the contrary, you can easily find Zhong shan [fm2,-] University in Xingang Road.
In [wd4,-s] area, GUFL is apparently much smaller than ZU.
You can just traveral [fm1,-] around the two niversities [fm1,-] and contrast the time you use.
Definitely it costs [cc3,-5] you much time to traveral [fm1,-] the whole ZU, while [wd4,-5] GUFL, quite a little time.
But that's pure natural scene, not live [wd7,-] the scenes at ZU, such as the man-made lakes, which are very beautiful and clean.
ZU does better in the pretection [fm1,-] of environment.
definitely [fm3,-] it needs improvement on the hand [wd7,2-] .
Ying dong [fm2,-] studuim [fm1,-] [fm3,-] , which was built with Mr. Huo Ying dong [fm2, -] 's funds is also the most attractive and practical one in Guangdong.
We annot [fm1,-] even find a good playground here in GUFL to hold a sportsmeet!
In general, ZU provides a more comfortable situation to its studens [fm1,-] , and GUFL, still needs many improvements.
A close riend [fm1,-] can share many thoughts with you, even his/her ecrets [fm1,-] .
In addition, they have the same or similar feeling on sth [fm1,-] .
You should feel sad or uncomfortable too and more or ss [fm1,-] , release your friend's sadness.
They just past [wd2,2-2] their greetings while meeting with you.
In addition, you see a friend more regularly or often than some one [fm2,-] else, so that you have more time to exchange your feelings and you [pr4,5-3] points of view, especially when you are close friends.
so [fm3,-] people we also can meet regularly or quite often, but they might not be our friends.
A real good friend can share bed with you without fearing that you will kill or hurt him at the [wd5,3-1] midnight.
" Then a loudly [fm1,-] yellow cat with brown stripes on its body was seem [wd3,-s] jumping down from the roof of a store beside us.
We even fed a cat which resembles [vp6,-s] that cat in appearance at that time, so that [wd5,s-] it recalled [wd3,-s] me of my cat when I saw that cat just now.
But you haven't concerned [wd3,-s] about your cat before.
And we had to see her growing thiner [fm1,-] and thiner [fm1,-] .
" Denise said in a nearly trembly [wd2,3-1] voice.
" So that you even didn't knew [vp9,3-] hat she died of, right?
" It's a pity that we don't wave [wd3,-s] veterinnarians [fm1,-] here.
There is something we cannot espect [fm1,-] ," I was trying to comfort her.
" I asked [wd3,-s] to feed 4 cats altogether [wd3,-s] .
I hate the people who treat my cats so cruel [wd2,6-] !
Gary looper [fm3,-] , an American cop, appeared on the street again.
Under the yellowish setting of the late nineteen [np9,2-1] century constructions, his black uniform was very eye-catching.
The shing [fm1,-] silver medal was hung on the left of his waiste-coat [fm1,-] , indicating his identity.
His age was not a secret, for everal [fm1,-] white hair behind his ears and the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes revealed it.
His pace was always steady and his hands mere [fm1,-] always powerfully moving with rythmn [fm1,-] while he walked.
His typical walking style had been so will-known [fm1,-] that whenever the residents spoted [fm2,-] a man with long leg walking in this way, even 50 feet away, they could assume that: Gary Cooper was coming.
In the chill [wd2,2-1] breeze, the thickly-dressed family are all looking inside the hospital earnestly.
Her chabby [fm1,-] face is resting comfortably on her father's head.
Another little irl [fm1,-] is in red otted [fm1,-] blouse and short- skirt.
Prossibly [fm1,-] lack of the mother's care, they all look casually dressed, especially ten [wd7,-s] father--- his mudelled [fm1,-] hair, his flare trousers creased, his shoes dusty.
When jthe [fm1,-] light turns on, I first try to hide in the shadow of the musquito-net [fm1,-] , shunning the sudden bright light.
But soon I find the white light just keeps peneatrating [fm1,-] my eye-lids; I suddenly opened my eyes, face the luminous ray, deeply inhaled the cool air and rise up.
Putting aside the warm quilt, I get out of the bed [wd4,-s] begin to put an [fm1,-] the clothes on the chair, which I have usually prepared the last [wd3,-s] night.
At about 6:20, dressed, I take cup, tooth-brush, ooth-paste [fm1,-] , towel and basin to the washing-room.
The process usually begins with the meticulous teeth-brushing [fm1,-] , because having suffered from some teeth disease, I am very conscious of teeth hygiene.
Ten minutes later, going back to any room, I take out some necessary instruments and sterilizing liquid to wash my content-lens [fm1,-] .
This requires even more meticulation [fm1,-] .
During this time, my breakfast, a cup of yogurt sent [vp7,4-3] onto my table; the loud speaker [fm2,-] outside is broadcasting the news on central [fm3,-] People's Broadcasting station [fm3,-] .
At 6:45, I quickly comb my hair, pick up the necessary materials for the corses [fm1,-] on that day and go out for morning reading at 7 o'clock.
For the nest [fm1,-] weekdays when morning exercises is required, that is another story.
Sear [wd3,-1] Dicle, I'm really very sorry to say that I feel quite uncomfortable because of the noises from you everyday.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, your radio is broadcasting "the hijack in china [fm3,-] " and " riots in Los ngelos [fm1,-] ", while I am still is bed, spending the next tormenting 2 hours.
At lunch time, when I [wd4,1-4] sitting at the table, ready to enjoy my favorite " roast duck" ,the roaring and never-ending cry of Jimmy, your little son, comes to my ears and makes me sit at the table, without appetite.
In the evening I have to put 2 cotton balls into my ears before I start to read my favorite book" Gone with the Wind", because the disco music from upstairs is not only shocking [wd3,-3] my whole room,but also my head.
Truely [fm1,-] [wd4,-s] ,               Chen.
Almost [wd4,-s] of the classes I have attended are very useful.
I even do not known [vp9,4-3] the teachers 'names when the school year comes to an end.
I often go to ShiZui Xian for dinner, but seldom go to Yun Bei because the enviroment [fm1,-] of Shi Xui Xian is much better than that of Yun Bei.
Behind ShiZuiXian, there are green fields while [fm1,-] make people feel comfortable, while behind YuBei, there is a stinking ditch which makes on [fm1,-] lose appetite at once.
It is very quiet in Shi Zhi Xian,nevertheless It [fm3,-] is very noisy in Yun Bei.
As She xui [fm3,-] Xian is much farther to the highway than Yun Bei, the air in shixui [fm3,-] Xian is much cleanner [fm2,-] and clearer than that of Yun Bei.
CECL is a now [wd3,1-1] approach developed by GIFL for Chinese learners of English to develop their communication ability.
This class usually consists of listening, reading, talking, writing activities, So you need to get your textbook, vacaburary [fm1,-] list, earphone, pen and of course, your partner ready before attending your class.
First of all, you should preview the vocaburary [fm1,-] list because there's no time for you to learn the new words in class.
The class usually begins by doing some listening activitis [fm2,-] .
Then omes [fm1,-] the reading activity, which is usually some fast-reading materials, Again, year [wd3,-8] will have to do a lot of exercises, such as summary of a text, gap-filling, comprehensive questions.
When a person has too much of something, he will certainly have the feeling of boredom, no matter how interesting the thing he first feel is, when there is othing [fm1,-] for one to do, this same feeling will certainly come up.
For a student, this feeling appears always [ad1,3-] when the [fm1,-] hurrying [vp4,2-2] [wd3,-2] the homework; for a husband, this feeling appears always [ad1,3-] when his wife prepares the same dish for him, or wears the same pajamas, for a lover, maybe when he or she always receives flowers from the same person .
Actually, No [fm3,-] one in this world that doesn't have boredom .
However every day [fm2,-] everyone is creating new boredom if he his [fm1,-] succeeded [vp1,-2] to abandon the old-which is not often the case.
Boredom results from all kinds of things, from doing homework, from travelling on business, from greeting [vp1,-1] to people, or even from drinking beer--which is longed for by most of people.
Boredom is something of great varities [fm1,-] , which no ne an escape from.
" Suddly [fm1,-] a voice came from behind.
I looked back and found a man of Middle [fm1,-] age looking anxiously at me.
" " 40 Fen, " very impationatly [fm1,-] I said to him.
" You see, my bag was cut by a theif [fm1,-] and the thief left me nothing.
A meal I saw a table with many things on it in the sitting room when I was opening [vp6,-s] the door.
There were three, white chairs which were folding were [wd5,0-4] put white folding chairs were put around the table.
Around the vase, there were two later [wd7,3-9] and one soup bowl were [wd5,-s] placed in good order.
You can [vp6,-s] see a deep fried fish in the plate, another plate with some oil white vegetables in it, and the the [wd6,1-1] soup bowl was foul [fm1,-] of sour and spicy soup .
All that seemed like [wd5,3-2] very delicious.
And then three small bowls with [wd5,3-3] full of rice were placed around the plates and the soup bowl.
Each bowl was occupied [vp7,3-5] one third of the table area and near the table --edge.
There was a pair of chocksticks [fm1,-] which was red.
I saw my father sat [vp4,4-3] on one chair, He looked like watermouth [fm2,-] eager for the meal.
West Virginca [fm1,-] Coal Miner's House is one corner of west [fm3,-] Virginia Coal Miner's House [wd7,-s] .
On the wooded [fm1,-] floor .
There is a rocking chain [wd3,-s] on the floor.
On the Chain [fm3,-] [wd3,-s] , there is a soft cushion on it.

The first poster is two happy graduated students in black stand [vp4,-s] on the globe.
Where reads "You can always shop to adventage [fm1,-] in the drag [fm1,-] store ".The second poster is put on right of the first one.
A little higher than the first one , Inside the poster,there is a Santa Claus who tables [wd7,-s] a bottle of coca cola on the right hand.You can find another big bottle of coca cola one the left of the Santa Clause.
On the top of this poster where [,-s] read "The pause that keeps you going " These two posters are cut carefully.
Waiting On one old [cc4,1-1] morning in the winter .
The man wearing a black windcoat [fm2,-] and blue jeans has brown curls.
The little daughter sitting on his [pr3,5-2] father 's shoulder is two.
Her white hair looks a little rumpler [fm2,-] .
Her father is holding her tight [cc4,-1] leg.
Another little girl with white culls [wd7,5-] wearing a flowered long wind coat [fm2,-] and a short skirt is four years old.
May be [fm2,-] They [fm3,-] have walked a long way and came here to find their mother.
So his wife left home and went to her count's [fm1,-] family on impulse.
In the morning I usually get up at 6: 30 .The broadcast [wd2,1-1] station of our campus wakes me up every morning.
Then I get dressed from the cloth hanger [wd7,-s] .
When the water is boiling, adding [,-s] two spoons of milk powder into the water and stiring [fm2,-] it, and then put three or four square [cc4,-1] sugar.
As soon as the milk is boiling, I breaking [vp4,-s] an egg into the milk and mix it together.
Wait are [wd7,-s] minute, it is ready to have.
I have milk and biscuit [np6,4-] for my breakfast.
After I finished [vp6,-s] my breakfast at 7:00 .I begin to listen to the radio--VOA, but sometimes I can't get the clear signal, so I listen to the China Radio now and then.
I prepare [vp1,-2] to class, combing my hair, wearing shoes.
Patting [wd3,-s] the books into the bag.
Especially the people from mothern [fm1,-] China.
She know [vp6,-s] a young man who came from Guangzhou in her hometown--Liao Lin province.
One monthly paid [wd2,2-] was equal to one year's in her hometown.
Lifang was attracted by his sweat [fm1,-] words and trusted him.
She followed the young man to come [wd5,0-1] to Guangzhou one month past [wd2,-] , the young man did not find a job for her.
Li fang [fm3,-] began to feel anxious because she almost ran out of her money.
The paid [wd2,1-5] would be one thousand yuan per month, and she could also have a room which was given by the boss.
A sixty year old man entered into [wd5,1-2] the room.
He looked sinister with his belly stuck [vp5,6-1] out.
So that [cj1,-s] , all her happiness was ruined poorly.
After I leant [fm1,-] that, the idea which was to be a secretary in the future was given up.
Athough [fm1,-] not all are the same case, I know I have to choose my job carefully.
Mrs Landlord: I am sorry to bother you, but I can not stand the noise come [vp1,3-3] from the [wd5,1-2] upstair, since they moved in, I never have a good time.
If the noisy [wd2,1-] continue [vp3,2-] .
In the morning, when the sky still is dark, they begin to do morning exercise [np6,2-] .
In [fm3, -] the room, running, jumping and even singing.
Sounds [np3,-1] is very disgusting.
I'm afraid that them [pr4,-] floor will fall down one [wd7,5-] .
I look at the clock, oh, my godness [wd3,2-] , It [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] a [wd5,-s] only five.
In the evening, I usually do my homework till 10.Every time, when I am thinking about something, I always [ad1,-s] be [vp4,2-4] disturbed by sharp shouting, chatting or laughing.
And they [wd5,-s] the voice [wd3,1-3] of the TV set can be heard a mile away.
So I can not concentrate my mind on study, I just go to bed, But when I lay [vp6,-s] down on the [wd5,1-1] bed, them [pr4,-3] mini concert begin I can hear a few boys join their party.
After I heard [vp6,-s] the Rock and Roll's music, I lost [vp6,-s] my appetite.
I have travel [vp9, 2-] two places, Xian and Hangzhou.
I was told that xian [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] a [wd5,1-3] an ancient city and has many historical monuments.
Size [fm3,-] terra- cotta figures.When I steped into there, I felt uncomfortable, every where [fm2,-] is so serious, everyone's pace [wd3,1-3] looked so sad.
I could say nothing beautiful there, [wd4,-s] only saw many clay figures, everywhere is so solemn.
Though the guild [wd3,1-5] explain [vp6,-s] to us so patiently.
I didn't understand why, that is one of them [pr4,2-1] rules.
The guide explained that the excavation of the underground [wd5,1-1] vault of earth revealed thousands of terra-cotta warriors and their horses in battle fomation [fm1,-] , and the whole army would follow its emperor into immortality.
After the travel of xian [fm3,-] .
We [fm3,-] went to Hangzhou.
Hangzhou has many senic [fm1,-] spots.
Such [fm3,-] as Monastery of the Spirits' Retreal, Pagoda of six Hammories and West Lake.
Hangzhou is famous for its west [fm3,-] Lake, it has such places of interest and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.
This is the second largest island in West ake--Landscaped [fm3,-] in typical Chinese style.
The guide as a pretty girl .She told us the story about this island, I was so interesting [aj4,-s] , Until now.
We sat on [wd3,1-2] the oat and enjoyed the beautiful scene.
I suddenly pelt [fm1,-] that I became a fairy maiden.
Travling [fm1,-] [fm3,-] in the fairyland.
On both side [np6,1-] of [wd4,-s] lake, there are two dikes--the Bai and the su [fm3,-] .
You [fm3,-] can see a row of vigorous willow trees.
They are decorated with coloruful light [np6,5-] , so in the evening, you can imagine how beautiful it is, There are many lovers under the tree [np6,6-] .
The [fm3, -] High [fm3,-] class restaurant and the low class restaurant.
There is a beautiful girl at the door, standing behind a counter, she will ask you did you make reservation [,-s] > If not, she will lead you to a table.
 [wd4,-2] Other one will bring you a small hot towel.
Another one will stand beside you, waiting [vp1,-4] you to order food, she often introduces the most expensive food or drinks to you.
She is so skillful [wd4,-s] I sometimes wonder whether she graduated from public relation [np6,1-] school.
People talk in low voice [np6,4-] .
Maybe,some people think the food of the high clan [wd7,-s] restaurant is cleaner than the low class one.I don't think so, I think the food is clean unless you go into their kitchen.
You must have good table manner [np6, 1-] .
There is not [np9,2-4] this kind of case in low class restaurant.
We usually call "Da Pai Dang" when [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] center [fm1,-] there, you will feel more comfortable, It seems everyone is your friend, you will feel [vp1,-2] like stay at your home, you can order food at your own will, Although the environment is not o good, you feel so free.
Instead of [wd4,1-3] controlled by others.
After you finish the meal, you will think it is worth [aj2,-3] to spend money there.
Everybody has friend [np6,-s] .
Some peoples [np6,-s] have many friends.
Without friends, they will feel lonely, everything will became [vp9,2-1] meaningless.
To other people, Making [fm3,-] friends is not them [pr4,-1] interest.They think building up friendship with a friend is wasting time, and friends will bring them trouble.
To another [np9,-s] people,they don't the [wd7,2-2] many friends.
They found [vp6,-s] real friendship only [ad1,-s] can be built up among two or three people.
So, different people have different opinion [np6,4-] to define friends.
She [fm3,-] can give her hand to me.
And [fm3,-] tries her best to help me get out of trouble.
It was very serious I felt too sick [wd4,1-3] go to class.
I can [vp6,-s] do nothing.
I didn't drink and eat, my illness became more and more serious.At that time, I missed my so [ad1,0-1] much family, I even cried on the bed.
And [fm3,-] gave me a few words of comfort.
Because [fm3,-] I was so moved that I could not help crying .I realized I really had a real friend.
I observed some different phenomenon [np6,1-] which people treat their friends.
When some girls have boy friend [np6,4-] , they don't like to make other friends, even girlfriend [np6,-s] .
They only like to spend all the spare time with their lover [np6,1-] .
And [fm3,-] become more and more unsociable and uncommunicative.
Weeven [fm2,-] talk [cc3,-1] heart [wd4,-s] each other.
Many times, after she went back home, I felt very lonely on [wd4,-1] campus and waited for her return.
Yesterday morning, something happened to us, I am used to listen [vp4,2-] to the VOA at 7:00 AM.
So rose and I are the last two ones [wd4,-] to leave.
' I couldn't help jumping up from the chain and crying and [fm3,-] then.
I turned back, "Oh,my God, it is you," I shouted angrily, "You want to scare me to die [wd2,3-] "?
I felt a little pain on my neck, "I just wanted to play with you, I didn't mean it, why you are [wd1,-s] so angry [aj2,-2] to me" She replied and her voice seemed almost to cry.
I didn't look at her and sat back to my chain [wd3,4-] .
I thought of [wd5,0-1] myself [wd5,-] that maybe I was too serious just now, we always make joke.
It was nearly the time for clan [wd7,-s] .
I took the bookbag [fm2,-] and walked to the chain [wd3,-s] .
My mother entered into [wd5,1-2] my room and moved out my treasured recorder.
eally, This [fm3,-] humorous conversation gained Rose's smile.
For the past two months, almost every afternoon, I found it hard to fan [wd3,5-] asleep while your recorder kept playing certain music.
Although most of the songs were my favourites as well, I did find they wore [fm1,-] not played at a right time, for I think the eriod of time between 1:00p.m and 2:30 p.m should be the time f st.
Yesterday, you kept playing the Rock roll [fm2,-] songs in a loudly [wd2,2-1] voice throughout the afternoon and I was orced to go out for a walk instead of sleeping.
Last Saturday night I was awaken [vp7,2-2] to find it was three o'clock in the morning.
Embarrassment [fm3,-] and even sadness.
Festival party is for everybody and ll the attendance [wd3,-s] have the chance to participate [vp1,-2] the activities rather than just sit and watch.
Dancing [fm3,-] and cheers.
We could all sense the gay atmosphere then and wore [fm1,-] delighted that colorful new days were coming soon.
Since I considered myself a close friend of the host, I used to act like a bee, often talking many [np8,-2] irrelevant nonsense ,doing many unnecessary things.
Academic [fm3,-] atmosphere and entertainment activities etc are concerned.
Locating [vp5,-s] at the foot of Baiyun Mountain , GUFL enjoys a autiful and tasteful [cc4,-1] environment, Which [fm3,-] allows its people to work and study in a peaceful way.
One can be free of the noise and excitement downtown, breatheing [fm2,-] the pure and fresh air here and taking a rest on the meadows or in the shadows of the trees.
Which [fm3,-] lies nearly at the center of the city, the noise and the polluted air from the busy traffic nearby and the [wd5,-3] several large markets and shops surrounding it does [vp3,-s] make people on the campus suffer a lot.
Occasionally you can have a public lecture or sth else, but most students are not very interested in it and the attendants [wd3,-s] are always less active.
Dancing [fm3,-] performance and poem reciting etc.
Owing to its large scale, every department is responsible for its own mattes [fm1,-] .
This course emphasizes [vp1,-6] more on training the student's ability of listening comprehension and spoken English and it also includes certain amount of exercises for writing and reading.
The whole textbook is divided into about forty units, each dealing with a topic of life, culture, history, geography science, medicine and [wd5,-s] etc.
Listening [fm3,-]  writing and speaking practice.
All these exercises are concerned about [wd3,-] the topic of the unit.
For example if the unit is about Cuisine [fm3,-] .
You [fm3,-] will need to read several passages about, say,the various styles of cuisine, the making of certain Chinese dishes, the proper [cc4,2-5] wrong of using western table wares etc.
Having gone through the passages, students will be instructed to some do exercises, say, writing down some points of the idea embodies [vp5,7-3] in the passages.
Through these oral practice [np6,2-] , the students will be able to not only practise their spoken English, but also express their own ideas upon the topic.
Before the teaching of each unit, students will be given a word [wd5,1-5] list of the new words and phrases to help them.
However, a lot of improvements are still needed to make it bettor [fm1,-] serve the purpose of teaching English majors    Friend  The dictionary has varied explanations for the word " friend " ranging from " person one knows and likes "to" helper to " supporter " No matter how different [wd2,-s] people view " a friend" as surely there is one thing in common, a friend should be a person who is familiar with you and you two do enjoy a relationship.
The friendship may make you believe that at least there are your friends in the world who will care about you and you may talk [wd3,-s] to for help.
For [fm3,-] your friends will assure you that they will always stand by you and be ready to help .
A friends [np6,1-] is a person who will do all the needed things for you without being asked for or paid for.
I can not imagine what my life will be if I fail to find any friend but only emimies [fm1,-] and hypocrites.
My frends [fm1,-] are part of my life.
The wind was blowing so fiercely that it [vp3,1-2] drive almost everybody back to his warm house.
Wandering aimlessly in the long, [fm1,-] peopleless [fm1,-] street.
When they passed a gate which had a severe wire screen, their feet were tempted by a sweet song of hymn, Oh, [fm2,-] what a peaceful little song!
" The father couldn't help looking through the window to see [fm1,-] what' [vp5,2-0] happen.
 [,0-4] He put [wd7,2-2] is younger daughter, fm2,-] who was not more than 3 on his shoulder and let the older one stand beside him.
They discovered a wonderful [np5,4-7] work on the other side of the gate, a warm, cheerful, [fm2,-] totally different [wd4,5-6] from the one they are living.
There was a young, amiable mother sitting at a stove in which the cheerful fire is radiating its red, warm light generously to the [fm1,-] whold house.
 [fm2,-] However, on the other side of the gate, you can't find any cheerfulness but sadness and the feeling of longing for something.
" [fm3,-] what a big cake they have!
They have so many [np6,4-6] candy and a dog who can dance!
" As she [fm1,-] though of this, her mouth was watering.
But a gale of [cc4,0-1] keen wind [vp1,5-8] made the poor girl [vp9,4-2] couldn't help [fm1,-] shiering with cold.
 [fm2,-] [fm1,-] He elder sister with baggy clothes and rumblered [fm2,-] fair hair, was staring [vp1,-] that amiable mother.
The other inside made she [pr4,1-] think of her own mother who left her only a vague but warm memory.
 [fm2,-] The father, who was as baggy as his two daughters, stared fishily forward.
A deep [np5,2-2] melancholy obviously remained on his face.
At about 6: 20 am, after a long struggle and self-encourage [wd2,2-0] , I manage to leap from the bed in great strength and enormous speed, This very action usually triggers a lot of [np6,3-3] complaint from the person who is sleeping on the above bed.
In the ten mintues from 6:20 to 6: 30 the begin [wd2,1-3] of morning [np6,1-0] exercise, the washing room is an extrimely [fm1,-] popular place to go.
I take a great difficult [wd2,4-3] in wedging myself into a [wd7,4-3] chink between too people and begin washing.
But how unfortunately I am, [fm3,-] the person standing beside me has a habit of washing violently, splashing water everywhere on my face and clothes.
But I have no time to quarrel for there are half [np6,1-1] dozen people waiting behind.
 [fm2,-] Then there comes another fighting-racing to the playground at sonic speed.
I am running in this army, looking firmly and [fm1,-] anxiouly at the destination, taking every slice of energy to try to touch the rushing line.
But this time, not for the gold medal, just for not having my name recorded on the teacher's little muster [fm1,-] boll for coming late.
 [fm2,-] The morning exercise lasts only five mintues.
The five mintues exercise is a kind of relaxation for the later fiercer competition- [fm1,-] rashing to the student's dinning room.
If you don't [fm1,-] harry up a bit, you'll probabally have to wait in the line , and [fm1,-] ore importantly, the most delicious food would have been sold [fm1,-] ut.
 [fm1,-] Due to y tremedous [fm1,-] speed, [fm2,-] I am always [wd4,3-3] the several persons who get to the dinning room first.
So I get my breakfast [fm1,-] easly.
 [fm3,-] sometimes I have a bowl of rice noodle and sometimes one or two buns.
But [fm1,-] alase!
 [fm3,-] Because I have to finish the breakfast and return back [wd5,1-] to the [fm1,-] domitory before seven o'clock, the time for listening to English [fm1,-] programm in radio.
So I devour those buns and [np6,2-0] noodle and this fast movement of mouth makes my stomach uncomfortable a whole morning.
 [fm2,-] Then I succeed in reaching the [fm1,-] domitory before 7:00.
Thanks Heaven, [fm3,-] before the class [vp3,3-2] begin, I have a short period of time to release [wd3,-] a little bit after all.
At the railway station Waiting train in railway [np6,1-0] station is almost a very happy and tiring experience in China, [fm1,-] espetially [fm1,-] her in Guangzhou.
 [fm2,-] Last winter holiday, I had an [fm1,-] unfotfetable experience in Guangzhou railway station.
My friend Zhang saw me off and [vp6,4-2] help me carry a big bag, [fm3,-] when we arrived, we were frightened by such a scene: [fm2,-] thousands or even millions of people huddled outside the station, [fm2,-] pushing o and fro, yelling and jostling.
Most of them were peasants who came to Guangdong provinee [fm1,-] to find jobs and at that time they re about to go back home to spend [np6,1-1] Spring Fastival [fm1,-] with their families.
 [fm2,-] When I took great trouble in wedging myself in the waiting room, I found I have my hand bruised.
Some even slept on the floor using their bag as [np6,2-0] pillar and slumbered heavily.
I looked around and discovered a seat was occupied by a very dirty big [fm1,-] gunnysack which was obviously owned by the girl sitting beside.
Actually, the girl was sleeping with her dust-covered face [vp5,4-2] expose to everybody.
 [fm2,-] Her hair was wild like coarse grass.
Her two legs opened widely and extented [fm1,-] to a long distant [wd2,2-0] but one of her [np6, 3-5] hand was holding tightly her sack.
 [fm2,-] Move away your bag!
" This great voice seemed to [fm1,-] starltle the girl, [fm3,-] she opened her eyes suddenly and looked frightened like a hurt bird.
At that time, I found the girl was very pretty, [fm3,-] she looked at most 16 years old.
She raised her amazing beautiful eyes looking at us heedly [wd7,-] and them quickly [vp6,13-5] move the sack off the seat.
 [fm2,-] I sat down and smiled at her and she [vp6,5-5] return me a sweet smile too.
 [fm2,-] Then we began a friendly chat.
She told me about her parents, her younger brothers and sisters and [fm1,-] them she claimed [fm1,-] poundly that she was good at pushing in the crowd and never bothered to buy a ticket and never failed to escape ticket checking.
But Suddenly, she stopped her mouth and became watchful as if [np7,4-3] a experienced hunting dog smelt something unusual.
Remember, ook [fm1,-] only ahead, [fm3,-] push hard with all your strength forward!
" Almost [wd4,1-3] the same time, the crowd began to gather towards the door, [fm3,-] everybody looked very determined and prepared for a war, [fm3,-] the great pushing forward movement began.
Children were crying and women [fm1,-] screened everywhere.
 [fm2,-] The situation was very dangerous.
I couldn't reathe [fm1,-] and I just wanted to cry.
I almost ate the hair of the girl [fm1,-] net to me.
After about 10 [np4,2-2] minutes deadly struggle, I found myself standing on the train alive.
A friend of mine who is working for CITs [fm1,-] GuangZhou branch as a torist [fm1,-] guide, often has many stories about her job to tell.
She called on me [fm1,-] nexpectedly at my dormitory [fm1,-] .
She was rather thin, campared [fm1,-] with the [wd7,7-5] precious time I had seen her, she seemed to have lost 5kg weight.
 [fm2,-] Her face was [aj3,3-4] darker and full of weariness.
And then she began [fm1,-] hr endless and angry complaint about her new job.
She said with great dislike "Everyday I have to get up very early, sometimes there is even no time to finish [wd4,7-1] breakfast.
And then I have a group of people [fm1,-] [vp5,6-1] fellow me wherever I go, which makes me feel like a fool.
" Knowing so much disadvantages of the job, I almost made up my mind that tourist [np6,1-4] guide was the worst job in the world.
Then I asked her: "How about changing,  [pr4,3-1] you job and try to find another one?
You get a lot of [np6,5-4] tip if you are Lucky.
He was in his late 30's and looked physically strong and mentally keen, advancing with big and rapid strides [fm1,-] n the street where only a few numbers of people were wandering.
One of his long [np6,4-3] hand was swinging forcefully, accompanying [fm1,-] the movement of his legs, while the other hand seemed never to be moved away from the pistol hung on his loin.
He was always watchful like [np7, 1-3] a excellent hunting dog and prepared to draw upon the gun to deal with any unexpected attack at any time.
He was wearing a belt round his waist in a casual way and a [wd7,1-5] packet watch shining [fm1,-] n the [fm1,-] un.
He had a long and ough [fm1,-] face with clear edges and corners.
That kind of roughness was only owned by those who had experienced innumerable dangers nd [fm1,-] trauma.
Although the brim of his hat had almost [fm1,-] elipsed his eyes, you could feel two columns of cold lights projected from them which would made everybody shiver with fear.
There is no doubt that [wd4,5-2] unusual was about to happen at his destination.
Mrs Brown, I am writing to you to express my [wd7,2-1] treat unsatisfaction [fm1,-] about the [fm1,-] nbearable noises your family have made and your ignorance on [wd3,-] my last complaint letter.
Every morning, Your family gets up as early as 6:00 and your warmming [fm2,-] up morning exercise follows.
I know your husband is a basketball coach, but it doesn't mean that he has the [wd4,s-] to bounce the ball heavily against the floor under which several people are still asleep.
We are all waken up by such dreadful bouncing [np6,3-0] noise and my old grandma is sually [fm1,-] frightened and made sick.
After the ball stops making [np6,4-0] noise, I suppose [fm1,-] a family sportsmeet [fm1,-] is taking place, [wd4,14-2] we hear [np6,2-3] noise of rope skipping which vp3,5-5] sounds like a working cutting machine and then I guess you must have other activities, such as high jumping and hurdle racing.
The enormously big noises come abruptly which can [vp9,1-2] made people mad.
I won't [vp7,2-2] surprise one day there will be a hole [vp5,5-3] appear in the floor and somebody will fall down if you continue to [fm1,-] stramp your feet with so much force on it.
In [np6,1-0] evening, things are not better than [np6,5-0] morning.
You always turn on your H. F. to the highest volume and [,0-1] I sure everyone on the neighbourhood knows you have owned a H. F. [fm2,-] The sharp, noise [fm1,-] ervades everywhere in our room, which [,9-11] is unable us to hear clearly the play in our own TV.
I hope the medical exam report of my grandma won't have [fm1,-] may [np6,3-0] problem, or I will phone the police and [fm1,-] cal my lawyer to handle this business.
Your angry neighbour              Mrs [fm3,-] john Friends I [fm3,-] have [fm3,-] had Friends I have had can be generally classified to two types: [fm3,-] One is the type I need most when I am in a good mood.
 [fm3,-] The other one is needed when I am in trouble, feeling frustrated, deflated or I have something that has to be confided.
Usually, friends of the first kind are those who have fairly cheerful, lively, [wd4,4-2] [fm1,-] socialable personality.
They are good at [vp2,4-1] making fun, [vp2,0-1] playing joke and creating humorous and happy atmosphere.
On [fm1,-] weekens, I usually go to movies or to karaoke [np6,6-3] bar with such people and always come back with excited and delightful [np6,4-0] feeling.
Especially, [fm2,-] when I am going to have a birthday party, these friends become very essential.
They are the most dynamic elements in the party, enlivening the atmosphere with all their capabitities [fm1,-] .
They are shuttling here and there among the crowd, like butterflies or little rats, dallying with people, [fm2,-] making faces, talking nonsense in order to make others laugh.
Sometimes they hehave [fm1,-] like a fool or a clown and never [wd7,4-7] cure what the other people think of them.
They make everyone feel relaxed and happy, without any doubt, having people like them, [fm3,-] parties often end up with quite a success.
Heating [wd3,3-3] my long, breakless [fm1,-] complaint, she looked even more furious than I, [fm1,-] cletching her fist and teeth, [wd7,5-4] curing with all her strenth [fm1,-] "Really a bad egg!
A [wd2,1-1] damn egg!
" At that time I was rather confused, for I couldn't make clear whether the fellow who offended me was the [fm1,-] enimy of her or mine.
We both sat there [wd4,4-2] kept cursing until my tougue [fm1,-] was tied.
Surprisingly, the feeling of angry [wd2,3-2] went away.
Friends of the second type not only can share your angry [wd2,2-0] but also your sadness.
If I tell a sad story of me to them, [fm2,-] usually, their tears have already fallen down even before I have enough time to concentrate all my strenth to produce some.
 [fm2,-] They are the people who are worth of my respect and faith.
But I love friends of the second kind [fm1,-] mush more, for they are my really reliable good companions.
> <TYP 2> weng yao A Letter to My Neighbour Dear Mr Smith, I'm sorry to inform you of some facts which have [vp6,2-1] bothering me for months.
The noise coming from your house day and night [wd7,9-5] twins my life into a disaster, I could no [fm1,-] linger keep pace with a regular [fm1,-] routin both during the daytime and at night .
 [fm3,-] this wears my patience away and finally drives me to ask you to have mercy upon my weak nerve!
Each morning when I wake up, my eyes were swelling and red, [fm3,-] this was [wd5,-] became the noise ,which was so loud and piercing that could drive people crazy, [,4-8] floating out of your windows a hole night long.
 [,0-15] People upstairs [fm1,-] where laughing, chatting, even shouting, in addition [wd4,2-3] the sounds of throwing ards [wd7,-] and mixing .
 [fm3,-] [fm1,-] he Majiang on a table were also clear.
In the [wd7,2-2] titlner of night, all [fm1,-] there noises were serving [fm1,-] an edles piercing through the ears and [vp1,0-3] caned me [wd3,2-3] feel tinnitus and headache in the daytime .
What's more, your [wd7,1-2] addcition to singing has no [fm1,-] night to [vp4,1-2] made me [vp1,2-3] suffering from no [wd7,3-2] neat at noon I must say you couldn't deprive me of the last chance to have a sleep !
 [fm3,-] why do you always play the Karo O.K.
 [wd4,4-1] noon?
 [fm3,-] Could you please turn the voice a little bit down?
To be honesty [wd2,2-0] , [pr1,10- 7] it sounds just like wild shrieks and howls .
 [fm3,-] as I [fm1,-] ouldn't enjoy my precious rest at noon, I always feel sleepy, [fm3,-] [wd3,0-3] sometime I even doubt I have got neurostheria, [fm3,-] as you could easily see from my face , I'm not myself anymore!
I hope this letter could [vp4,1-1] drown some of your attention and the situation [,2-4] to be improved, even slightly.
I'm looking forward with all my heart [wd4,7-3] a quiet night, of [fm1,-] coarse, with your help.
Friends I Have Had Two kinds of my friends: one is active and [wd7,4-0] oacious, the other is quiet and withdrawn, who are seemingly [wd7,3-1] throughout different, have accompanied me through my life from childhood till now.
They are always cheerful, preparing for any joke or mischief at [fm1,-] ll time.
 [fm3,-] however what attracts me [fm1,-] moat is their wisdom, [,0-9] no matter where out [fm2,-] standing performance [wd3,2-3] ensures spoting them easily.
because they are quick-witted, they are [wd4,2-2] teacher's favorites and always the winners of any math-competitions.
Dealing with such friends, you will be easily infected with their light hearts and humorous "remarks"-always [fm1,-] mischivors [fm1,-] bur not ill-willed-and you will be influenced unconsciously by their flexibility and elasticity, which [vp3,4-6] is [np6,5-5] a major [np6,7-3] component of their [fm1,-] haracteristics , and sub-consciously become more adaptable to [wd4,2-1] new environment .
 [fm3,-] to be short, those people [vp3,2-3] makes you more active towards life.
However, if I hadn't the other kind of friends, my life [fm1,-] woud have been incomplete and I myself [vp7,2-0] [vp6, 9-1] paralyzed.
They are always timid, sensitive and sentimental, [fm3,-] you could hardly predict [,4-4] what is their intrinsic quality.
They look like ice, but inside they are fine, burning silently and [fm1,-] ometimes, when you reach their heart, this fine [wd4,2-3] will warm you and light your eyes.
Two schools during my middle-school study, I have changed [np7,3-3] the school 3 [wd3,3-0] time.
One is an [fm1,-] xperimental school in a coastal area, the other is in my [fm1,-] ometown, which is isolated from the outside by [wd4,1-2] range of mountains.
The experimental school is a fairly large one and modern one in content [wd3,s-] with my hometown school.
It has more than 1,000 students and teachers, the school buildings are six-floored, which is rare for [np7,4-2] the ordinary middle-school, and it has a standard sports ground which is covered with sand around and well-cut grass in the centre.
 [vp5,0-8] Comparing with it, the ground of my hometown school, which is only covered with mud and weeds and becomes [wd7,10-3] disabled in rainy season simply becomes a play [fm2,-] ground for children to ride bikes or playing kites in the spring.
All the equipments [fm1,-] and facilities of the experimental school are newly bought or established.
That [wd7,-] became it's a newly set-up school with a history of less than 15 years.
The experimental school, since located in the coastal area, [cc3,9-2] recieves [cc3,-2] much influence from overseas adapts an open [fm1,-] teaching-mathed [fm1,-] , that is, to put more emphasis on the student's ability in performing well not only from an acdemic [fm1,-] angle, but also from the moral, physical and artistical [fm1,-] point of view.
Besides this, they also exchange students and teachers with its counterparts abroad and often bolds discussions even debates among students, [fm3,-] by this means, students are supposed to develop comprehensively.
In comparison with it, the hometown school still concentrates on the traditional teaching method--- teacher- centrism, [fm3,-] among those classes at different [np6,5-3] grade, you can find their curricula are fully arranged, [fm3,-] there's no spare time left for students to learn by themselves, not mention [wd3,-] the time [wd7,3-5] prepared for them to practise computers, work out the model airplanes or play the musical instruments as their [fm1,-] connterparts in the experimental school do.
It's obvious that both teachers and students are aiming at one thing: entering to [np6,2-2] university or colleges, as their ultimate purpose!
I know that most of the months you're out on business, which [cc5,1-6] leaves your home sometime like a battlefield, a sport field or a bar.
Every morning, I'm waken up not by my alarm clock (I'm afraid its sound now is too weak for me), but by your children's quarreling ver [fm1,-] who should make break fast.
It often [vp3,2-] last over an hour.
Michael Jackson's pops [fm2,-] songs may be their favorite , they never forget to play it when they "fight".I feel ever [fm1,-] terrible in the afternoon.
Your kids choose the floor as a skate [cc4,-] field.
With Michael Jackson or some heavy metal on the tape, they imitate their singing, shorting , jumping .I can only pray that the floor won't be broken.I'm afraid you know little about your kids.In the evening, they seldom make [np6,1-] noise, instead, I often hear some [np6,1-] scream or crying from the horror [wd2,0-2] video tapes they play.
Either a short [fm1,-] of "Ghost" or "I'll call of you !
" make me tremlle [fm1,-] .
Or the gunfire, or a savage laughter, [pr1,7-0] they arouse my imagination and I'm really living in a might mare [fm1,-] [fm2,-] .
Could you be so kind enough [wd5,2-] to spend a little more time at home and tell your kids to make less noise?
There is a kind of [np9,5-2] teachers who like to read what's on the text books.
 [pr1,10-1] He is too prudent to have his own opinion.
When I attend [pr1,12-1] their classes, all I have to do is to take notice of where the teacher is reading and make a mark there.
No note is necessary even though teachers [wd7,1-1] chink [fn2,-] oppositely.
Also the whole class is rather uiet [fm1,-] .
Some are reading novels, some are writing letters, some are even listening to walk man [fm2,-] , leaving the teacher by the platform practising [vp5,1-0] read-aloud.
But another kind of class,not like the [wd7,1-2] fore said one, makes us dictating all the time.
We are kept writing like machines, occasionaly [fm1,-] [fm1,-] [vp4,7-4] look up at the teacher with a begging expression, "Could you please slow down your reading?
" Time eems [fm1,-] to never pass normally in such kinds of classes.
 [vp1,0-20] There are still [fm1,-] ome teachers both follow the text book and have their own opinions and most of all, let us have time to [vp4,5-2] think, to exchange ideas at class.
 [fm1,-] ome [fm2,-] times I take note of the information not in the text book, sometimes follow the teacher's instruction to think , to develop my opinion.
TWO SCHOOLS The first impress [fm1,-] on [pr5,2-6] that schools A and B give you are different stepping into school A,you'll see a small garden with roses, camellias, cannas and other colorful flowers .
 [fm1,-] long each side of the road is a line of Chinese parasols.
From the board on the gate of the building, you can see it's onated [fm1,-] in 1992 by a well- off patriotic overseas Chinese While over the garden, the main building in A--the English teaching building, was built 50 years ago, Some windows are broken, too.
While in B, a single physics Department has 35-storey [np1,2-3] buildings as regwlar [fm1,-] classrooms and a T-storey laboratory building.
Another notable thing you may easily find is that there are much more girls in A than in B. that [fm3,-] mainly due to [np9,2-2] that fact that A in a college of languages and B is [np3,2-1] science university.
Not like other major English courses like College English or Comprehensive English, CECL course is more vivid and effective for students' first [np1,0-4] two years of basic training in colleges.
Traditionally, students are faced with a long text with numerous new words and grammers [fm1,-] and they have to prepare a lot before the new lesson: look up the new words on [wd3,-] the dictionary, preview the text and so on.
Words phrases and grammer [fm1,-] are the centre of their study.
But for CECL, there is a specific topic for each unit, such as family, to wris [fm1,-] and sport .
Gcturally [fm1,-] , there are few long passages or [np6,4-2] text in CECL, but more listening ,speaking and writing exercises.
When the lesson begins, some simple questions related to the central topic are raised by the teacher and comes a small warm [fm2,-] up discussion .Usually there is an [cc4,1-1] according [wd3,-] record by [np7,-] foreign expent [fm1,-] or the same topic [np6,0-5] student then listen to the tape, sometime take notes, to see how's the conversation going.
fter [fm1,-] [fm3,-] that, the teacher helps the student go through some specific terms for the unit.
For Tourism, there will be [np7,3-5] the introduction of famous scenic spots in China and abroad.
They are devided [fm1,-] into several groups and try [vp6,s-] their best to present vividly some situational dialogues to the whole class.
There are almost 20 practical topics in CECL, [wd3,8-3] concerning a wide range.
But equally more of [pr1,4-3] these are ruled out.
Students are the centre of the lesson [wd3,-] in [fm2,-] stead of the teacher, which, few other courses can have this as a characteristic.
He pats on your shoulder to give you strength and a sign of under standing [fm2,-] when you lose a match .Passing you a towel or a rink, " [fm3,-] one cannot always be the champion don't [fm3,-] let yourself [fm1,-] own!
He understands [,2-12] when you part with your girl- friend much better than your parents do .
He shorts [fm1,-] your ears when you've lying lazily on bed a whole day, "Hey ,guy, enough rest !
Do not be a lagy [fm1,-] bone!
" Sometimes, he is a patient brother, in other time, he is a good guy to play with , and he could be one [wd3,-] instructor as serious as an old grandpa .
Also, he needs your comfort when in bad mosd [fm1,-] and invites you to enjoy his happiness.
He may have some shortcomings, as on [fm1,-] one is perfect .
He is always on [wd3,-] your mind and he always gives you courage and confidence.
But when I got there, no assistants could been [fm1,-] seen.
" the latter and younger one tried to soothe the elder assistant , " Nowad [fm1, -] ay, people are crazy for money!
"Excuse me," I hesitatly [fm1,-] asked, "May I return the books now?
" well [fm3,-] , No, when I started reading I found the wants [wd7,-] already there.
"" Why didn't you fell [fm1,-] us when you borrow it ?
It [wd7,1-2] want be you !
I had thought the assistants must have made all the checkings [fm1,-] and I had been in a hurry when I borrowed it .
 [fm1,-] " Two [wd3,3-3] man for each place.
but I'd like to make a complaint with [wd3,-] you .
I find myself [wd7,3-2] smote by noise, which has a rather bad effect on me .
I know that you are a musician and have made a small name [cc1,1-] of your own.
But when you are going to bed , you drop the shoes on the floor and the sound is loud enough to awake and start [wd3,-] me.
I haven't had a good sleep for days now, neither can I [wd3,3-5] make it up in the morning, for then, you are plactising [fm1,-] your saxophone.
It not only puts an end to my repose, but also makes me unable to hear the [fm1,-] whether broadcast on the radio or the news about stock market on TV.
You host a party every weekend and will not disperse [wd3,-] it until 2 o'clock in the morning.
If you would please to dissoloe [fm1,-] [wd7,5-3] the party earlier, put down the shoes gently and postpone your time of practising saxphone [fm1,-] I would be much obliged .
Yours sincerely Three kinds of friends enter my life, tinge it with colours and add its richness: the close friends, the nodding friends and the good-weather [wd7,-1] friends.
I appriciate [fm1,-] and truly love my close friends, because I an confide in them nd [fm1,-] in return I am trusted by them, I precious [wd2,1-2] such friendship.
Though there are no frequent exchange of presents and no sweet [wd2,2-2] flatter between us, I m clearly aware that they really care for me as much as I [wd4,9-1] them , and will jump with alacrity at my asking for elp [fm1,-] .
They give me their hand when I am in bad time, listen patiently to the troubles I pour out to them, and some how [fm2,-] remove it magically .
To stay with them is happy because I can wear my heart [cc3,2-] on the sleeve and need not keep myself to myself.
Straight [wd3,-] for word remarks even [np6,3-2] criticism are welcomed.
We can get along well by joking talking story-telling or playing ogether [fm1,-] , though we would not touch the deeper issues of one's mind.
 [fm3,-] We pick up some general and afe [fm1,-] topics like what happens to a friend recently, or whether she or he likes the job or what place [pr5,2-2] where I visited last summer vocation.
When we depart, [pr1,3-] it become a part of the memory.
No regret for departure, but is willing to meet next ime [fm1,-] .
To those good-weather [wd7,-1] friends, I dislike them.
They are [wd7,2-3] adows [fm1,-] in the sun and will disappear into this air as soon as darkness befalls.
No.2 Middle School is a key school in Guangzhou, there fore [fm2,-] in comparison to the former one, it is more [aj3,3-3] strict in many aspects.
2 Middle School has higher [aj3,s-] demand for the entrants.
Because of its fame, is school attracts many students who hope that they can better [wd4,2-4] education nd [fm1,-] training for the college entrance [np6,3-1] examination.
Good and potential students are enrolled, thers [wd7,6-1] rejected.
While the Attached School is only a common chool [fm1,-] , although it is quite famous for its nglish [fm1,-] teaching and aclievements [fm1,-] , it attracts far less students, not to speak of scientific students.
The grade line for the extrance [fm1,-] is correspondingly lower.
The overall quality of he tudents, there fore [fm2,-] , is not encouraging .
Second, he [fm2,-] NO.2 [fm1,-] MiddliSchool [fm1,-] ets [fm1,-] up a higher standard for its students on their study.
The textbooks, especially maths, physics and chemistry textbooks it ases [wd7,9-3] are more diffult [fm1,-] than those of [np6,2-2] Attached School.
While in the ttached [fm1,-] School , due to the overall quality of the students, most of them are only [vp7,5-2] require to understand and master what the textbooks say and use these knowledgt [fm1,-] to do the exercises that are not difficult to deal with.
In addition, the strictness of NO.2 Middle School is lustrated [fm1,-] in its daily-life.
the leaders are very much oncerned [fm1,-] with students' appearance and behaviour.
Students are forbidden to coear [fm1,-] ornaments, boys are not allowed to have long hair, long fingernails [vp3,2-1] is unbearable.
Further more [fm2,-] , students are required to wear uniform at least 3 ays [fm1,-] a week.
Even in [wd7,2-2] oozen [fm1,-] winter mornings, girls have to wear their uniform of western-style dresses.
Students are free to wear colourful clothes, and have small ornaments to add [cc6,-] up their beauty.
This is away vigorates [wd7,3-2] the campus.
CECL, the full name of which is Communicative English for Chinese Learner [np6,5-6] is a set of comprehersive [fm1,-] textbooks.
It covers such knowledge as greeting people, job, food , sports, tourism, economy, and so on , [wd4,3-4] each aspect as a unit.
 [fm1,-] ne characteristic of CECL is its large amount of new words.
Therefore, before the start of a new unit , he teacher will ive [fm1,-] each student a list of the new words of the unit .
Futher [fm1,-] preparation depends on the tasks which will be done in class.
After that, the teacher will give the answers and analyse the tcpscrips [fm1,-] .
Then comes the second exercise, reading usually, students are required to read the articles before class, look up some words , and have a rough idea of the out line [fm2,-] of the articles.
In [np6,1-3] the class the teacher [fm1,-] ill explain some language points and draw students' attention to some useful words and expressions.
When the students have [vp4,4-3] make clear of the contents exercise be done, which help the students to a better understanding.
It provides good [np6,3-3] opportunity for the students to prictice [fm1,-] their spoken English.
And by listening to others opinion [fm1,-] [np6,5-2] , they have a deeper impression about the text.
 [pr3,14-3] They are the writers as well as actors.
General [wd2,0-1] speaking, CECL is an unique course in which [np6,0-2] teacher and students play equal roles.
Students volutarily [fm1,-] take part in the activities and there fore [fm2,-] master the knowledge more effectively .
But it does not exclude boredom, an in dispensible [fm2,-] element without [pr5,3-10] whose contrast [wd7,3-9] life would no longer appears so interesting and wonderful .
Students often suffer from boredom, when they lose their earings [fm1,-] or have no interests in study.
Hollowness and impatience often occupy their [np6,1-1] heart and has [np7, 1-1] a effect on their further studies.
Hobby and different hings [fm1,-] they take up .
Attending class may be dull , because some of the knowledge is losing its attraction, and the way in which some teacher lecture [vp3,2-3] bores the listeners.
The teacher will simply stand at the platform, reading at the top of his voice the sentences which we can find in the text book [fm2,-] .
" How boreing [fm1,-] it is!
" is the concensus [fm1,-] we get after each class.
It seems contra [fm2,-] dictary at the first sight.
But if we know that monotony and repetition are often the featlres [wd7,3-2] of work, it is not difficult to see that even you have something to do at hand.
Boredom is a common disease in the souety [fm1,-] , but not an incurable one.
The best way to frive [fm1,-] it away is to find something which is really of your interest, do it and enjoy it.
a [fm3,-] young man was standing behind me ,one hand taking hold of the iron bar overhead .
as [fm3,-] the bus picked up more passengers along its route, I began worrying about thieves.
luckily [fm3,-] I had never met them, though I often heard about their "good deeds " on buses .
so [fm3,-] consciously, but pretending to be carelessly , I touched my pocket.
The money was there, save [fm1,-] and sound .
several [fm3,-] minutes later, I was aware that a woman was looking at me strangely, her face wearing an expression that I couldn't fully explain.
 [fm3,-] he was quite uncomfortable [fm1,-] under my staring and hastily looked away.
But I was not trapped [fm3,-] my friendly manner made him [wd4,5-3] at a loss.
"um um, " he made his head move up and down, and squeazed [fm1,-] a smile on his face .
He was not that nervous , but was still embarrassed to be [fm1,-] caugh red-handed.
" [fm3,-] hope you good luck next time," I said and [vp6,3-0] smile.
" [fm3,-] thank you .
" [fm3,-] he was almost grateful at my words and even friendly patted my shoulder.
 [fm3,-] as the bus stopped, I jumped off, and could [wd7,2-8] at wait to tell my friend all about it .
" [fm3,-] you must be [fm1,-] crasy," she said, " aren't you afraid that he would stab you ?
" [fm3,-] no, I was not  [fm3,-] it was a strange but true experience.
 [fm3,-] perhaps he was not a bad guy at all and perhaps in his eye ,I was still a [fm1,-] na* ve [fm1,-] but daring little girl.
Patriotism This is an event nearly every Chinese mailand [fm1,-] people and Hong Kong people alike have been awaiting with massive [cc4,-1] excitement and great expectation -- the reunification of Hong Kong to China.
It is a moment of celebration, proud [wd2,4-1] , anticipation and above all, the most telling moment of patriotism which is deep in our heart [np6,1-] .
To people, on numerous occasions, it is a mighty momentom [fm1,-] , spurring us to implement [cc3,-4] the most formidable tasks which would have been impossible otherwise.
In [np7,-2] Olympic Games, you can not only feel the touching emotion of patriotism, but also come face to face with it: you see how athletes surmount the various "hurdles" with applaudible [fm1,-] stamina and most important, fortitude, whose sourse [fm1,-] is exactly their love of their country; you see athletes fall from illness but stand up to their task even with a dripping; you see athletes stumble to the ground but climb up and go ahead; you also see champions cry movedly [fm1,-] when their national flag rising [vp4,4-1] proudly.
At such [np7,1-1] moment, they are no longer themselves, rather, their country and their people who also embrace the same burning patriotism and back them all the time.
Outside the stadium, patriotism draws people to TV, newspaper [np6,5-] , focusing on what's going on in the games; even they would fly to the spot somewhere far far away from their home [np6,12-] .
With it, not only have we weathered untold defeats, shame, poverty, natural disasters, political strife, financial crisis, but also we are building [vp1,-3] up our country industriously and hopefully.
The recent years have witnessed the prosperity in our economics [wd3,3-] , advancement in education, improvement in diplomacy ... .
To a country, Patriotism [fm3,-] means cohesiveness [wd3,2-] .
Cohesiveness [wd3,-2] means omnipotence, With it, we are fearless.
With this in mind, we have been making [vp2,-2] our utmost to negotiate and eventually reach an agreement on the issue of Hong Kong territory with [np7,-2] British governement [fm1,-] but for [pp1,15-3] all the barriers.
This dream has been both long [wd3,5-] and hard [wd3,7-] for us, while, in the end, the reality in the wake of the dream is sure to be promising and encouraging.
With the same patriotism in mind, we're to live up to our designated aims ahead -- to embrace HongKong [fm3,-] and still to come, Macao and Taiwan and to better an integret [fm1,-] China all the time.
Though she is little [wd3,2-1] educated, she has a good sense.
I used to live with her and my counsins [fm1,-] when I was small because my parents were too busy to look after me .
She got up the earliest in the morning and sleeped [fm2,-] late at night.
She worked hard yet [wd5,3-2] without complaining.
As she had been [vp6,2-6] busy ever since she was young, she looks older than she really is.
Her face is wrinkled, her hair turns silver white, and some of her teeth become movable [wd3,3-] .
Though her grandchildren have grown up and the family condiction [fm1,-] has improved, she refuses to do nothing.
She had just been [vp6, 3-8] to school for several years but she taugh [fm1,-] us how to act through her experience.
My Dad  When I began to write this article, I wondered what information I would get from my memory about my father because, sometimes, Dad seemed so strange to me. [sn,s] .
Dad was [vp6,7-] one of the most ordinary kind of people with few words.
The deepest impression about him in my mind was [vp6,8-] his always [ad2, 1-2] rough [wd3,-1] face.
In my childhood, I was usually too scared to look [vp1,-1] him in the face.
Sometimes I would feel shamed [wd3,3-3] of his ordinariness.
An episode happened and changed my perception [wd3,-] towards dad.
At [pp1, -2] that night, I was so surprised to find dad singing songs and talking loudly and excitedly all the time.
It seemed that something which he had hidden in his heart for a long time bursted [fm2,-] out.
And I found the things I had neglected or so many years at [pp1,-2] that night.
Families decorate [wd4,2-1] home [wd3,2-3] inside and outside after they had [vp6,8-3] a spring cleaning.
During the time, Xmas tree is very popular because people think it can bring good luck, and then in every home, there is a beautiful Xmas tree decorated with coloured light [np6,9-] .
Sometimes, in many communities there is the costom [fm1,-] of decorating a big Xmas tree for out-door display.
Before the Xmas Eve, most people exchange presents and send Xmas cards to their friends, relatives and bussineers [fm1,-] associate [np6,6-] .
Before going to bed, children hang their stockings by [np7,5-1] fireplace, hoping some sweets and toys will be given by Santa Claus.
In [np7,1-1] USA, especially Handel's Xmas choral [fm1,-] music "Messsiah" are [vp3,5-1] heard everywhere during the season over the radio, On [fm3,-] TV or in department stores.
To compare with the western Xmas, the chinese [fm3,-] Spring festival [fm3,-] exists the similar points, [s8,s] it is also the biggest chinese [fm3,-] holiday.
On New Year's eve, each family has a great reunion dinner, and the peak of the celebration activities fall [vp3,6-4] on New Year's Eve and the day after.
For instance, the people will stay up till 12 o'clock, then they will cheer themselves up and burn the firecrackers [cc3,3-] , do some bless for [vp2,4-2] each other, etc.
According to [np7,-2] Chinese tradition, making jiaozi (dumplings) on the fifth day of the lunar Calendar will bring good luck in the new year.
On the night of Yuan Xiao, also known as the Lantern Festival, [np7,-2] Chinese custom calls for the display of Lanterns inside or outside of the homes [wd3,5-] , according to [np7,-2] Taoist belief, the Lord of Heaven visits the earth on the Lantern Festival to confer Luck and happiness on those who are morally upright.
After reading all this [pr1,1-1] things above might help you widen your horizon to know more about the western culture and the eastern one.
 [sn,s] .
He favored Copernicus theory which declared that the earth is [vp6,5-2] a planet which revolves [vp6,8-1] around a fixed sun.
For to do so, he was be delivered to the torture Chamber of Inquisition. [sn,s] .
Although he was compelled to renounce his belief, he didn't give up flighting [wd3,4-3] with the Inquisition untill [fm1,-] he died on January 8, 1642.He left the world he loved far better informed than it was when he entered it.
Nowadays, scientists have proven that in some special situation [np6,2-] , we can show the potential of our physical ability and do something we can not do in usual time [pp2,2-] .
Suppose the boy was about to kill his father, the words "I am going to kill you" should sound more hoarse and terroble [fm1,-] , different from the words "I'll kill you" we said in our daily life.
Secondly, I am still not sure whether the woman weared [fm2,-] her glasses or not when she was tossing and turning.
One of my friends often goes to bed, forgetting to put off [vp2,3-2] her glasses, and she often finds that the [np7,13-2] next morning.
Christmas and the Spring Festival   The Spring Festival in China and the Christmas in USA are both the most [wd4,2-1] festival of the year.
In those days, the people [np6,-4] in the two countries have vacation to celebrate the new year.
And the [np7,-1] Christmas also has a fairy tale to celebrate the birth of Christ.
The Spring Festival and the [np7,-1] Christmas are also different.
In those days, people decorated [vp6,19-] the gate with the traditional color of red, especially the red lantern and the couplet with blessing words.
In the United States, the spirit of Christmas arrives about a month before the holiday itself, December 25. ate in November, street lights and store windows are decorated with the traditional Christmas color [np6,-4] of red and green.
Fir tree [np6,1-2] , holly wreaths, and mistletoe are familiar sights.
In [pp1,-2] [np7,-2] Spring Festival, most of the Chinese will go home from other places to have a family reunion.
It's the most important and happy [aj3,3-] thing to all the Chinese, because we have a most deep [aj3,2-] love to [pp1,1-2] the relatives.
On Christmas, many American families go to church and enjoy a traditional Christmas dinner just like [np7,1-1] Chinese, but I don't think it's [pr1,19-] as important as to the Chinese.
And now more and more people going to church is only for fun. [sn,s] .
Both in the Spring Festival and on Christmas, are children [wd1,10-] the happiest because they can get a lot of gifts.
In American [wd3,1-] , children could receive toys from Santa Claus in their stockings and they exchange gifts with their parents under the Christmas tree.
Besides they can also get money from their grandparents, aunts, [wd4,2-1] uncles.
I like the days of [np7,-2] Spring Festival, for I can relax to my heart's content.
Do you think the art [wd3,-1] course and the science course should be completely separated?
The art [wd3,-1] and the science are two different courses, but they connect [vp7,2-3] to each other very much.
The art [wd3,-1] trains people's understanding skill, and the science trains people's logical skill.
However, the understanding and the logical skills are both very important in the art [wd3,2-4] and the science.
In China, from senior [wd4,1-1] school we separate [np7,2-4] art [wd3,2-3] from [np7,3-2] science completely.
How to study the art [wd3,4-] and the science, here I have some opion [fm1,-] of my own.
Actually good studying methods are all good to the art [wd3,-3] and the science.
However, the art [wd3,1-3] and the science lay particular stress on them [pr1,s-] .
For example the art [wd3, 1-] needs more memory and the science requires more observation; the art [wd3,1-1] students should have more understanding efforts [wd3,1-] and the science students with more logical efforts [wd3,1-] are better.
In studying art [wd3,2-] , you should have more patience because there are a lot of things for you to memorize and most of the things are very similar to each other.
The art [wd3,1-3] and the science are of the same importance to our society.
I believe if we were good at both of them, the society would develope [fm1,-] more quickly, I hope the day is not far away.
 [,s] when [fm3,-] I was ten year [np6,1-] old, I was sent to [wd4,-1] countryside, stayed in [wd3,-] my uncle's.
Approaching the Mid-Autumn Festival, I was still [wd7,6-] happy, but on that night, everything changed.
When my favorite food were [vp3,1-] set on [wd4,1-] table, everybody was ready to enjoy them [pr4,1-] , I was sad at the sight of the moon, because I missed my family very much.
So [wd5,-s] , at [wd5,-s] that night I was thinking about how lonely I was without my family around me to share the food night [wd7,-s] .Even [wd5,-s] tears came into my eyes.
I couldn't tell how sorrow [wd2,-2] I was!
But [wd5,-s] this year, I don't [fm1,-] .
I have [vp6,-s] stayed in the campus.
Because I have had [vp6,-s] an appointment with a young man with whom I almost fall [vp6,-s] in love.
I was very excited [fm1,-] and a little nervous that night.
On that night, we sat by the west Lake in [pp1,-2] the campus, looking at the bright full moon talking.
We talked about our childhood [np6,1-] , our present life [np6,2-] , our family members and Chinese literature about moon.
To my joy, we are [fm3,-] both keen on Chinese literature and we have [vp6,8-] much in common.
I wished my most memorable Maid-Autumn night [np1,-3] would last for ever.
we [fm3,-] got together, talked freely and ate the traditional food.
We talked about experience [np1,-2] of life, experience [np1,-2] of study and almost everything.
The traditional food included moon-cakes [fm1,-] , fruits, peanuts and riversnails.
Spending the whole night with them, I relaxed myself and forgot the burden of my study [np1,3-0] .They all treatly [wd2,-1] me nicely.
I will never forget that night --- the most happy [aj3,-1] Mid-Autumn Festival night in my life.
I decided to spoil her for the particular occation [fm1,-] .
I bought a large splendid delicate [wd4,1-1] birthday cake.
My sister-in-law had a gift for her two [fm1,-] .
After having dinner, my family were [vp3,1-] all sitting together watching TV.
Then TWO large birthcake [np3,2-] turned up.
it [fm3,-] t was 12 pm and it was time for us to set off.
Afterwards we sat down together eating mooncakes and watching the partial lunar eclips [fm1,-] .
It was meaningful for us to see the lunar eclips [fm1,-] at the Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
Everyone has his/her beautiful memory about Mid-Autumn Festival night, for it is such a mice moment for Chinese people [np7,2-] , What's mine?
Mine is eating moon-cake [fm1,-] and fruits and appreciating the round golden moon with my family.
When I was young, I spent 15 such night [np3,2-] at home with [wd4,-s] father, mother, brother and sisters.
At [pp1, -3] that [np3,1-] happy occasion [np3,3-] ) my mama always told us stories about the moon, talks [vp6,6-] about the Moon Goddess.
Every year , the story [np3,2-] was [vp3,1-] different and attractive.
But [wd5,-s] now I will never have such [wd4,4-] chance.My mother parted [wd3,-1] away and I always spend my Mid-Autumn Festival at school .
Oh, My [fm3,-] memorable Mid- autumn [fm1,-] Festival night [np3,3-] )is [vp3,1-] only in my memory.
every [fm3,-] one has spent [wd3,-3] many Mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] [np3,2-] and every one has their mot memorable one [np3, 7-] .
My meroble [fm1,-] mid-Autumn [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-] night [fm3,-] is the one of last year.
why [fm3,-] ?
Because it was the fist time that I didn't spend those [pr1,-1] festival with my family.
Fortunately, I made friends with five girls who came from different place [np3,1-] of Guang Dong we [fm3,-] live in the same dormitory.
I will never forget mid-Autumn [wd6,-] mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] night in 1996 in my life life.
 [wd6,-] 	Mid-Autumn Festival is one of our Chinese traditional festivals.
People enjoy the festival very much, because almost all the embers of the family will get together and it is always very fun.I like this festival very much , my [fm3,-] most memorable a [wd5,-s] Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the one two years ago.It's [fm1,-] a exception [np7,-1] , for I selebrated [fm1,-] it with my friends near my house , carrying [fm3,-] our lanterns, mooncakes fruit, and [wd5,s-] spent the whole night on the mountain playing games, watching the moon, [wd4,1-1] eating the food.
It's [fm1,-] very fun [wd2,1-] to make a wish under the moonlight.
The most laughable thing was that one of my friend [np3,2-] ate clay , instead of the mooncake,because of the darkness.
We slept for a while untill [fm1,-] dawn.
It was very excited [aj4,-s] , and from that night, I realized that friends must share their trouble and joys [np3,-2] .
I had known that I would have a chance to watch the moon changing from a bright round one to a dark one , on the night [pp1,2-] .
I waited patiently for the appearance of the grant [fm1,-] sight.
at [fm3,-] about 2 'clock, the moon changed into a smaller and smaller NEW MOON.
Suddenly it became a complete [wd2,-1] dark one.
Little by little it turned [vp1,-s] a round one.
I have ever seen the grant [fm1,-] sight before.
I had a wonderful time and missed [wd3,-s] those delicious food [np3,2-] very much.
I can't [fm1,-] forget that Mid-Autumn Festival night which I spent with my university colleagues.
As a rule, people spend that night with their families, but I have to leave my mice [fm1,-] family for university.
For the first Mid-Autumn Festival at university, we had prepared the delicious fruits and some mooncakes --- the two things we can't [fm1,-] lack for such a traditional festival.
The most memorable thing during that night was playing charades with my colleagues [wd3,-s] .
From the Family AIbumn [fm1,-] U. S. A. we should [wd3, -1] play American games on such a Chinese traditional festival.
I'd [fm1,-] never had so memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.
Sometimes thing may go on beyond your belief and thus [wd2,-s] was what happened to me last Mid-Autumn Festival.
I was sitting alone in my room and listening sadly [ad1,1-1] to the noisy and joyous sound [np6,s-] outside that night when there was a knock on the door.
I opened the door and could see a box of mooncake [np3,2-] on the doorstep.
Smiling, she said "Happy Mid- autumn [fm1,-] Festival.
It's [fm1,-] on Tuesday last week that the Autumn Festival met [wd7,-s] , my [fm3,-] friends and I enjoyed a happy night.
It's [fm1,-] the first Autumn Festival that I spent in college, it's [fm1,-] very special [fm1,-] , I felt.
I followed my friend to her relative's home in order to have a delcious [fm1,-] supper.
Before we arrived there, they had prepared all the dishes, they're [vp6,5-] of many delicious kinds.
We enjoyed the supper and had a very happy time.after [fm3,-] the meal, we can taste many kinds of fruit [np3,2-] ,it's [fm3,-] the most favourite meal that I had in Guangzhou, since [cj1,-s] we can't [vp6,5-] do anything but have meals from dinning hall, and every student complains of these bad meals including me .
After we came back to our dormitory, my roommates and other people who lives [vp3,2-] as [pp1,-3] the same building as we do enjoyed a very very happy night.
we [fm3,-] layed [vp4,-] lanterns together and [wd5,-s] so [wd5,-s] so I can say last Autumn Festival Night is the most unforgettable one!This year's Mid-Autumn Festival gave some memorable things to me , it was a wonderful day.
So [wd5,-s] my [fm3,-] roommates and other new friends were together playing some wonderful and enjoyable games, but the most important thing is that I had chance to get to know new friends.
And [wd5,-s] I could eat my favourite food, such as moon cakes [fm1,-] , fruit, etc.
Although I couldn't [fm1,-] come back to my house always missed my family and my lovely dog.
I could only give my parents a call, but I can't [wd3,-s] feel depressed.
Because I don't [fm1,-] try it [wd7,-s] befor [fm1,-] this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.
On that night, you can eat a lot of things, such as mooncakes, fruit, rivernail [fm1,-] , teak [wd7,-s] ect [fm1,-] .
when [fm3,-] I left home, I spent the most lonely Mid-Autumn Festival Night, also it's y most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.
On that night I ate whatever I want [vp3,4-] to.
After a delicious meal, I'm [vp3,4-] full as the fullmoon.
It was for babies [wd3,-s] , so I sat at my desk le.
Unfortunately, It [fm3,-] so happened that they were out.
My loneliness was getting more and more [wd4,-s] , Starrng [fm1,-] at the full moon.
It was my only partner on such a only [fm1,-] Mid-Autumn Festival.
Do you spend your Mid-Autumn Festival Night in The [fm3,-] same way like me?
I always spent [vp6,-s] that night with my family.
We often sat together in front of the house, talking [vp1,-1] everything, eating things, but [wd5,-s] ,on the most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night, I was alone.
Around [pp2,-s] midnight, the moon became the roundest and the lightest [wd3,-s] on [pp1,-2] that night.
At about one o'clock, the lunar eclipse began, and we could only [wd5,-s] see most part of it, and [wd5,-s] we [fm3,-] could less of it later on.
Almost [ad1,-1] at three 'clock, we could no longer see the moon.
Since we can't [fm1,-] see the next lunar eclipse until sixty-years later, it's [fm1,-] worthy [wd3,-s] seeing it.I can't [fm1,-] forget that night for I have [vp6,2-] the chance of watching it.
I spent most [aj3, 1-] memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night when I was in he junior middle school.
It's [vp6,6-] the first time that I hadn't [vp6,-s] stayed with my family during the Mid-autumn Festival night.
It happened that the day was Saturday, and almost all the residents far away from home stayed in school.I missed my family very much, because it was the traditional festival for Chinese family to stay [wd3, 1-] together.
But [wd5,-s] I was a one and I had no moon-cake [fm1,-] .
TO my surprise, one day students carried their on-cake [fm1,-] and fruits to my dormitory.
) a beautiful lantern [np3,8-] .
when [fm3,-] I was a little girl, I also liked to [wd4, -1] so with other children in our big yard.
My most memorable Mid-autumn Festival night was the night when I was eight-year [fm1,-] [np3,1-] old.
after [fm3,-] having supper, I went out lighting a lantern which I liked very much.
With my little good friends, I came to the Dongjinag river bank and saw some people playing firecrafts [fm1,-] .
Suddenly, a "rocket" flied [fm1,-] to me.
It was a pity that I couldn't [fm1,-] let my lantern hang in the balcony through that night.
And [wd5,-s] it was so unforgetable and memorable.
My friends and I brought all kinds of food [np3,2-] , fruit [np3,1-] and cold drink to the lawn, where [pr1,-s] were already full of happy people, to celebrate the special night.
We also bought 2 beautiful lanterns, but one of them was burned a hole because the lighting candle in it was tilted [wd3,-] .
But [wd5,-s] when we saw that, we couldn't laughing [vp6,-s] and thought it was unforgettable.
Moreover, when we opened 2 bottles of Pepsi-Cold, the drink [wd3,-2] in them spurted our faces suddenly, we [fm3,-] looked at each other and convulsed with laughter.
How fun [wd2,1-] it was!
While we were appreciating the most bright [aj3,-1] full moon in this year, we were enjoying all kinds of delicious things we bought [vp6, s] , talking, singing and dancing like any other people.
Then [wd5,-s] we spent a happy night.
During the first month, I had to have military training, and my family is [vp6,8-] far away from University, so I had to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival night without my parents [wd4,3-] but my roommates for the first time in my life.
On that night, after bathing myself, I went to the compus [fm1,-] to enjoy the beautiful, round moon with my roommates.
when [fm3,-] we were walking around, I saw a lot of people strolling and chatting with their families, their children holding a lantern [np3,3-] in their hands laughing or running around them.
I also saw some people sitting on the grassland eating fruit and mooncakes [np6,-s] and enjoying the bright moon.
All of these reminded me of my parents and the happy time I spent with my families [np5,-s] on Mid-Autumn Festival night.
This was the first time I wasn't [fm1,-] at home on such a special night and had no lanterns, no mooncakes and [cj1,1-1] other special things in season to eat.
what [fm3,-] I had was he happy memories.
before [fm3,-] I entered university, I spent all my Mid-autumn [fm3,-] festival [np3,-3] at home.
But last year, I left my parents and enter [vp6,4-] university.
Because my house [wd3,-s] is far way from here and we were having a military training at that time I had to stay here on the Mid-Autumn Festival.
At [pp1,-2] that night, we got two apples each one .
Roommates [np4,-2] and I went out walking .
Since [wd3,-s] we didn't know each other very well, and still were strange [wd3,-s] to our campus, we had a lovely time.It's [fm1,-] the first time I had spent [vp6,-s] the mid-Autumn Festival with strange classmates instead of my parents.
Also It's [fm1,-] the first step I became inddepent [fm1,-] .
That's [fm1,-] my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
I always spent my Mid-Autumn Festival with my family But this year, I entered the university, I have [vp6,3-] to spend my Mid-Autumn Festival with my friends.
We went to the grass-land [fm1,-] to see the beautiful moon.
and [wd5,-s] we [fm3,-] had all kinds of food [np3,2-] food to eat everyone [fm3,-] enjoyed it.
we [fm3,-] talked about the original tradition.
 [fm3,-] we also played games.what [fm3,-] a good time we had!
The moon in [pp2,-2] that night was the highest [wd3,3-] the biggest and the roundest in this centry [fm1,-] .
That lunar eclipse was the most marvelous one of those [pr1,-1] centry [fm1,-] .It appeared at the [wd5,1- 1] mid-night, so he didn't go to bed to [wd3,-s] watch the process [wd7,-s] of it for it was really a good chance.
After that,more and more [wd7,-2] the moon was eaten, and the earth became darker and darker.
At last, the moon was eaten up, all the world became a piece of dark [cc1,3-] .
First it looked liked a boat, then half an cake [np7, 1-] [wd4,s-] at last it was a full moon.
The earth was covered with silver again And [fm3,-] we could see each other again.
It was unforgetable [fm1,-] .
The Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival I spent this year is [wd4,-1] most memorble [fm1,-] .it [fm3,-] was my first time to spend such a special night leaving home .
At [pp1,-1] night, we had a party on the playground.
We danced, sang, told stories and ate the typical food for this festival--- mooncakes and lots of delicious fruits as we appreciating [vp9,2] the beautiful full moon.
The light that the burning firecrakers [wd3,-s] gave out looked so beautiful in the dark night that we all cheered excitedly.
I enjoyed myself very much at [pp1,-2] that night.
What's [fm1,-] more, I've got got closer with my classmates since that night.
at [fm3,-] first, I thought I would be lonely, but I changed my thought at last.
My favorite thing in Mid-Autumn Festival is moon-cakes [fm1,-] , since it is delicious, I like to eat so much at a time.
This was the first time I spent the special night without my family, but it is [vp6,9-] really wonderful and memorable, isn't [vp6,5-] it?
I always spend [vp6,-10] my MA [wd7,-1] Festival Night [wd7,-s] with my family.
Since then, it was [vp6,-] the most memorable night for me.
Later, we went out to the champus [fm1,-] and decided to play a [np7, 1-] game [np3, -s] .
These games included charades and walking compete [wd2,-1] by tighting [wd2,-2] one foot of one person with that of another, then [cj1, s-] made a pair [wd7, -2] with three feet.SO [wd5,-s] it's difficult for the [wd7,-s] to walk straight.
We always fell down because of uncooperation [fm1,-] .
So [wd5,-s] it made great fun not only to [pp1,-1] ourselves but also to [pp1,-1] the people sitting around us.
We spent the night, eating , playing and also [wd5,-s] laughing.
Because I was missing [vp6,-s] my family.
I was in a little low [wd7,-2] .
Suddenly I heard laughing [wd3,-s] around me.
At [pp1,-2] the playground we talked, singed [fm1,-] and enjoyed the bright , round moon.
The moon-cakes [fm1,-] seemed to be specially delicious because of our happiness.
then [fm3,-] we played charades.
This Mid-Autumn Festival night is the most unforgetable [fm1,-] and I'll keep it in my mind for ever.
Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night, in [wd5,-s] this year, is memorable.
This year I spent the Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night at school instead of at home.
TO my suprise [fm1,-] , things were not as bad as I had thought.At [pp1,-2] that night many of my classmates and I went out to enjoy the round and bright moon.
the [fm3,-] fruits that we brought at [wd5, -] that night.
When we played "two men three feet", some pairs [fm1,-] couldn't cooperate well and they almost fell on the ground.
The games made us laughed [vp1,2-] all night.
The Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night in [wd5, -1] this year will be in my memory for ever.
Mid- [fm1,-] autumn festival is a traditional occasion [wd3,-s] in China.
People attach important [wd2, 1-1] to it.
Before [pp1,-2] several weeks, they prepare for it.
They will visit old friends and relations with moon cakes [fm1,-] moon to keep [wd3,-2] their friendship.
When I as a little girl, my gramma [fm1,-] would tell e the story about the moon.
We sat [vp6,9-] outside and watched [vp6,20-] the moon.
Gramma [fm1-] told [vp6,8-] me that there are [vp3,-1] a beautiful lady whose name is chang'er and her servant Wugang in the moon.
and [wd5, -s] Chang'er is accompanied by a beautiful rabbit.
n ancient [wd4,2-] a beautiful young lady didn't want o get old, so she stole some lixins [fm1,-] and took them [wd4,2-] .
TO her surprise, she became a fairy and flied [fm1,-] to the moon.
In id- autumn [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-] , you will see Waging cut a tree and the rabbit superintending [fm1,-] him.
Each time, my gramma told me e same story, but I was attaracted [fm1,-] by it.
There are many memories of Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival in my brain [wd3,-s] .but [wd5,-s] the most memorable thing is eating moon cake this year.
After supper at [pp1,-2] that night, my family were sitting [vp3,1-] around the table and watching the moon.
we [fm3,-] were happy in [pp1, 1-] eating fruits and having jokes.when [fm3,-] we saw the whole round moon, my father said: " lets [fm1,-] eat moon cake.
But I was treated [wd3,-s] .
The moon came [fm1,-] was not [wd4,1-1] usual one, it was made my by [wd1,2-0] cousin.
Of course, I didn't know [wd4,1-] .
Oh, I was liked [wd2,1-2] a clown at that time, red eyes and red nose.
My family laughted [fm1,-] and I laughed too.
Although I was treated [wd7,-s] .
We all like [vp6,8-] to have fun.
I had a happy night in [pp1,-3] Mid-Autumn Festival.
 [np6, -] towards them are vastly different.
Fortunately, this [np9,-] kinds of views have changed in China.
Instead of the passimistic [fm1,-] waiting, they prefer to the progressive way to die.
Lastly, let [wd4, s] see the feasibility of it.
The social development has enable [vp6,s-] China to pratice [fm1,-] euthanasia.
There is [vp3,1-4] no scientific problems in it.
China also has pratised [fm1,-] in some area.
Apart from all these elements, some people argued [vp6,s-] that the legalized euthanasia may invite abuse.
It will be a good news [wd4, s] all the Chinese.
We can not refuse eating because of choking, all the thing [np6, 2-] we need to do is to reduce the bad effects as well as possible.
(t8-11) The Gulf War had been [vp6,s-] over for two and a half years.
It will be written into history with its bombards [wd2,2-] thundering and fire burning.
Now it is all over, though [ad1,s-] it will appear in text books to illustrate war theories or middle-east [fm3,-1] policies.
Both side [np3,1-] have shown [wd3,-] their great courage during the war.
The Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the Amerians [fm1,-] and others, everyone [wd3,s-] fighted [fm2,-] bravely for their own country.
There are always wars, fightings [np5,-] and blood.
The purpose [np6,s-] of fightings [np5,-] are various --- power, freedom, land, resources, religion, and even women.
But one thing never changes with time [np5,-] or political situation [np6,4-] --- people believe they fight for their country, or their nation.
We can find examples very easily, from the war between antient [fm1,-] Greece and Rome, to World War II, during which faith to homeland was proved to be [wd4,1-2] great power.
It was such power that helped people drive away fascist [np6,s-] which [pr5,s-] had thrived and prospered by destroying everything.
It is a deep feeling from one's heart, so does [wd3,d] love to one's nation.
Human [np3,s-] are social animals.
They are eager to be accepted by others, so they gathered [vp6,s-] and form tribes, nations, and states.
They have to pay for the acception [fm2,-] and protection --- that is, [wd3,s-] love, faith, and dedication to the country.
The Gulf War had been [vp6,s-] over, but other wars are going on and new wars will break out in the future.
(t8-12) Maybe our world wouldn't exit [wd3,s-] if there hadn't ever been wars.
Wars have greatly pushed the society [np4,1-1] advance almost in every respect, especially in science and technology.
The conflict [np6,s-] includes boundary problems, nation problems and religious problems, some of which have been hung-up [fm2,2-2] for centuries.
Of course, war reprents [fm1,-] the dark-side of the world and indicates the limit of man's mind.
For example, Tom stole Sam's wallet then Sam can report Tom to the police and the court has [wd4,1-3] right to punish Tom.
Even if he committed [vp1,-s-] [vp6,s-] to protect [wd3,1-2] the verdict, his individual power is too weak to help him escape.
But as to the countries, there couldn't be a law which has force on all the member countries, because each independant [fm1,-] country has its own social system and no other country has [wd4,1-3] right to manipulate it.
Though we have drawn [wd4,-] several international treaties, still some super nations can break them easily.
It won't disappear until man's spirit reaches to an extremely holly [wd3,2-1] degree.
Once war breaks [wd4,2-] no one can avoid it.
Just as we Chinese had to fight back [wd4,2-2] Japanese devils in the second [wd4,s-] war.
All the wars have the same essence but the [wd5,4-2] different forms.
From spear [np6,1-1] sword [np6,2-1] gun [np6,3-1] tank [np6,4-3] to biological weapons, atomic bombs and missiles.
Modern war has put [wd4,s-] emphasis on the sky than on the land.
We Chinese fear war because we're afraid to lose the present peaceless [wd2,2-] We have suffered so much from war that we'd rather the earth were destroyed than war broke [wd4,2-] But the fact is that no country can refuse war if it does come.
You don't mean to fight others but others want to fight you Mao Zedong has such a famous saying: we don't offense [wd2,s-] others until others offense [wd2,1-1] us.
(t9-1) 	When our teacher wrote this topic in [wd3,-2] the blackboard, it aroused a heated dispute among our classmates.
One boy said with regard to either physical strength or intelligence, women are poorer than men, and since the differences are [wd5,3-2] alway [fm1,-] exist, there is not any necessarity [fm1,-] to try to find equality.
Some other boys said that it is impossible to have a [wd5,1-6] real and absolute equality [np5,4-2] in reality.
So we should take the unequality [fm2,-] for granted and feminine movement is just [wd4,2-3] waste of time and strength.
I don't agree with them, neither [wd3,d] What I believe is that the two genders should treat each other equally, that is, respect each other and understand each other.
The [wd5,-2] God endows [vp1,-3] us different appearences [fm2,-] personalities and abilities.
Discriminating [vp1,-] women not only harm [vp3,4-] women but also waste [vp3,s-] human resources.
So I think men who believe he [pr3,6-] is superior to women should learn to respect others, especially women.
The equality, which [wd5,s-] I thought [vp6,s-] is not absolute equality.
It is unrealistic to require that the number of female presidents should be exactly [wd4,1-2] same with [wd3,2-5] the number of male presidents.
What I think is that women should have more oppertunities [fm1,-] in the society, such as in finding jobs promoting, or getting the same salaries.
The oppertunities [fm1,-] also mean that woman [np3,1-5] could have their own choices, that is, if a woman wants to get out and find a job, she should have freedom to do so; If she chooses to stay at home, she would not be accused.
So woman liberation does not necessarily mean all woman [np3,1-1] should go out and find a job, but rather means [vp1,-3] give every women [np3,1-] the opportunity to choose by herself.
Abuseing [fm2,-] women is a common phenomina [fm1,-] [np6,2-] Therefore how can we think feminin [fm1,-] movement is [wd4,1-3] waste of time and useless?
And when will women and men, all the human being [np6,3-] can exist harmonily [fm1,-] and equally?
(t9-2) 	Decades ago, chairman [fm3,-1] Mao, the great leader of Chinese revolution claimed: "Chinese women are half of the sky!
" Decades later, however, Chinese women haven't yet own [vp9,2-] half of the sky.
That Chinese women play an essential and indispensible [fm1,-] role in China can't be denied.
While the western countries launched overall women liberation campaign [np6,4-] China, also put foward [fm1,-] laws to protect women's rights.
According to statistics, only 26% [wd4,-2] government official [np6,3-] are women.
Though women do [wd3,s-] phyiscally [fm1,-] weaker than men, they are no weaker in intelligence.
Unfortunately, men chavvinism [fm1,-] pervades.
A lot of people have a prejudice that women are unsuitable for management or politicis [fm1,-] Men chavvinist [fm1,-] [np6,-1] revel in seeing wife [np6,2-2] cooking, washing [wd4,5-4] doing all house chores in the kitchen while husband [np6,s-] sitting comfortably and lesurely [fm1,-] watching TV.
And when a woman show [vp3,3-] talent in managing, she is unlikely to be promoted, since the boss (usually they [pr3,s-] are male) are [vp3,s-] skeptical about women's ability.
The root of men chavvinism [fm1,-] is China's long feudal thinking influence.
Confucins [fm1,-1] proposed "husband [np6,-2] guide wife [np6,2-] " and "women's virtue".
Women's virtue means " [wd4,s-] wife [np6,s-] is subordinate to [wd4,s-] husband [np6,s-] and at [wd4,1-2] husband's [np6,1-1] disposal.
" So, when a women [np3,1-] excels, even nowadays, a lot of people still tend to consider her an unprincipled women [np3,2-] Since [wd5,s-] according to women's virtue, a female shouldn't go beyond home, insteadly [fm2,-] their [pr3,s-] duties are doing homework and waitting [fm2,-] on [pp1,-1] husbands.
These old ethnical [wd3,d] codes if not possess [wd1,2-s-] a dominant part, at least [wd4,s-] a considerable place in many people's minds 	I can give you an example.
This year, a foreign trade company askes [fm2,-] for five graduate [np3,1-] in our institute.
Just five boys, otherwise, we would go for [wd3,1-1] another college.
" It sounds somekind [wd2,-] ridiculous.
" That's cruel reality, women's ability aren't [vp3,2-] universially [fm1,-] acknowledged.
It's said Chinese women's social status is [wd4,1-1] highest [aj3,1-1] in the world.
Chinese government even put [vp3,s-] high priority in [wd3,1-2] women issues.
While the women's liberation organization play [vp3,4-] increasingly important role [np6,2-1] in western countries.
I call on Chinese women become [vp4,s-] more conscions [fm1,-] [aj2,-1] about themselves.
Since the reason of the present unequality [fm2,-] not only go [vp3,5-] to men, but also resides in women's part 	Some Chinese women is [vp3,3-] greatly influenced by conficusism [fm1,-] They take it for granted that women should stay at home, and it's no good for a women [np3,1-] to go to work and become [wd4,1-1] focus.
Once I was asked by a girl: "What's your criteria for boyfriend [np6,1-] ?
" She was surprised: "What if your boyfriend [wd4,3-2] a worker?
They can't marry a woman whose background [cc4,-4] and degree [wd4,s-] higher than themselves " At that time, I realized how deep [wd2,s-] the "women's virtue" effects [vp1,s-] [vp6,s-] 	Today, Chinese women enjoy more and more rights and their legal rights are respected.
However, it's still time for us to say that they've own [vp9,1-] half the sky.
They haven't yet own [vp9,1-] half of the sky.
Therefore, I propose feminist [np6,2-5] would do good to women.
This is attributed a lot [wd5,s-] to the women's liberation.
Feminists have done a great deal [wd4,2-3] good rather than harm to the cause of women.
The most outstanding goal of feminists is struggling for the equality with men in the fields of economic [wd2,4-] political [wd2,5-] and social [wd2,4-] Their efforts have been proven very helpful to improve the women's status, especially in the first and the last field [np6,6-] 	In the economic field.
Women used to stay at home, taking care of the children, cooking, washing and doing all others [wd3,1-2] kinds of houseworking [fm2,-] They didn't go out for work to earn their own living.
" So, "negligible" is the only word occured [fm2,-] to them when women expressed their opinions and wills.
They encourage women go [vp4,s-] out to work, to be independent [aj2,-1] to men in finance so that they can be themselves since they do have to "take men's opinions too seriously.
Feminists fight against this not only because it is a [np7,-1] economic inequality, but also because it is a social standing's inequality.
They are in opposition to the sex discrimination in work and insist that women must have the same wage with men of [pp1,2-] same job.
There are many other goals feminists fight for, such as seeking the political equality, preserving women from family violence and sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place [np6,2-] against pornaghapha [fm1,-] and using women in advertisment [fm1,-] for example, just recently, some university students held the demonstration against "the Miss Hong Kong Contest", appealing for preserving women's dignity, stopping selecting beauty.
In conclusion, feminists play a very important role in improving women's status, they have done a great deal [wd4,2-3] good to women, and will continue to [wd3,1-2] their jobs more efficiently.
In ancient China's moral codes, there were three virtue guides, among them was "Husband [np6,-2] guides wife [np6,2-] ".
In human's long history, women were undisputably [fm2,-] placed on a submissive and inferior position.
Concerning women's education, for example, many schoolaged [fm2,-] daughters of poor peasants are kept in the house, helping with the housework, in order to save money to sent their brothers to school.
Most college admissions officers admit that freshmen women enter with higher marks and better high school records than freshmen men, as if because [wd5,s-] only the best-prepared girls are encouraged to try for college.
Our institute as well as thousands of other universities and colleges in China face [vp3,12-] a big problem of assigning female graduates to working units.
More chances of promotion are given to men instead of their female colleages [fm1,-] who may have the same or even better ability of fitting the post.
Christine Craft, a Kansas TV anchor earned $38,500 a year, half of her male co-anchor's $75,000 salary [cc4,1-] Even so, her boss once said to her, "you are too old, too unattractive, and not sufficiently deferential to men".
Generally speaking, the society has a wrong expect [wd2,2-2] of women, it see [vp3,1-] women as the genre dependent on men to make decisions both at home and at job, staying at home taking care of the family, sacrificing their creativity in return [pp2,s-] of marital harmony.
It also sets a fix [wd2,2-1] standard of how a woman should be: it is not necessary for her to receive as much education as man, she doesn't have to work as hard either.
Women's liberation movement is the result of these injusice [fm1,-] and misunderstanding.
Its goal is to achieve women's public and political identities seperate [fm1,-] from that of their husbands, as well as their freedom to lead the kind of life of their own choice.
The two sexes should have equal chances in education, job and home decision, and they should coorperate [fm1,-] in all these aspects.
So, forward [wd3,-] women's lib!
During more than of [wd5,2-3] a century of your struggle history [cc1,1-] great changes have taken place.
Laws of women protection are promogated [fm1,-] in countries all over the world.
While the most important of all woman [np3,s-s-] have gradually stand [vp9,3-] up and are ready to defend their legal rights.
However, any change can be bitter and hard to procede [fm1,-] So never stop, women's lib.
Forward [wd3,-] to stop the unfairness!
Forward [wd3,-] to free the men from the burden of supporting psychic [np6,2-] [wd7,s-] as well as financial dependents!
Forward [wd3,-] to give women true happiness to embrace their own fate [wd7,s-] !
Forward [wd3,-] to achieve eternal human harmony between the two sexes!
Forward [wd3,-] women's lib!
That experience are [vp3,2-] now the exception rather than the rule.
By the end of the 1960s the women's movement had succeeded in challening [fm1,-] nearly all traditional cultural assumptions about women's proper place.
They challenge employment discrimination, bias against women in politics, and the antifemale [fm1,-] prejudice so dominant in the country's major economic and social institutions.
They also fight for [wd4,1-2] repeal for [wd5,2-3] of abortion laws, provide support for alternative life-styles, and, above all, raise the consciousness of women to the cultural bondage of being categorized as a sex object.
In America, though the administration of Ronald Reagan consistently adopted positions [wd4,2-3] anathema of [cc1,1-1] feminists, the same administration appointed the first woman justice of the United States Supreme Court, named two women to the cabinet, and claimed to be more committed to women's rights than any previous administration.
In [wd3,-3] the influence of the movement, the quantity of women in employment has been increasing.
In the second place, massive changes had occured [fm2,-] in family life.
Because of the faminists' [fm1,-] effort, the family violence is decreased sharply by public opinion.
Also because of the faminists' [fm1,-] effort, informed by changing attitudes [wd7,s-] toward individual fulfillment, hundreds of thousands of young women have charted a new course for themselves, [wd4,s-] free of many of the constraints that in the past had assigned women to prescribed roles.
In the third place, the professional women appeal to stop the sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place.
On the other hand, the prostituting [vp1,1-1] is publicized [vp1,3-3] an illegal thing to prevent the porn trade from developing in many countries.
In the forth [fm1,-] place, the women fight for [wd4,1-2] repeal of abortion laws and the freedom of lesbian (of course, it is not suitable in China).
In the fifth place, Many [fm3,s-] women are against [pp1,s-] they are used as a model in advertisment [fm1,-] In fact, it is useful for the employers to improve their goods' quality.
If the employers decrease [vp1,-4] to use the models and improve the quality to attract the customers, it is a good thing for society.
Clearly, enormous changes have occured [fm2,-] both in the daily experience and in the cultural norms describing masculinity and femininity in society.
The changes appear almost revolutionary in dimension [np6,6-] But it was [vp6,d] too early to conclude that dramatic progress toward equality had taken [vp6,s-] [cc2,s-] place.
Therefore, at last I appeal to everyone in society to participate [wd4,-] the feminist movement which heigtens [fm1,-] the women's positions.
(t9-6) 	One prominent and controvercial [fm1,-] campaign of this century is the feminist campaign.
The Feminists, with their awakening consciousness of the women's value and human dignity, call for the equality of women with men in terms of economy, politic [wd2,1-2] social role [np6,3-3] and other aspects.
It comes into [wd4,3-2] feminists [np4,-1] mind that women have always been in a discriminated position in [wd4,1-3] access to job [np6,2-] Firstly it's difficult for them to get a job.
Many companies would rather employ a man even [wd4,s-] his ability is much lower than the female applicant.
Secondly, if the women are finally employed, their salary [np3,1-1] are pretty lower than her [pr3,s-] male colleagues though they do the same kind of work.
Another proposition [np1,1-3] to protect women from [wd3,s-] the feminists is to curb the ill-treatment towards women.
In the world where male [np3,-1] dominate almost all the enterprises, women, as their subsidiaries are in a very disadvantage [wd2,2-1] state.
It's rather frequent that female [np3,s-] suffer from the harassment from their bosses phisically [fm1,-] and spiritually.
Plenty of women stay at home, caring for the house and the children while [cj1,s-] financially rely [vp5,s-] on their husbands.
So, when they are battered by husbands, they are in very negative position for they have no financial support in [wd3,3-2] their back, so they may possibly submitted [vp9,2-] this, would reverse to worsen their situations.
The call for political equalty [fm1,-] is may be [fm2,1-] the most fundamental and significant one.
Women won their right for vote in the near [wd7,2-1] 1970s.
Today, they are taking [wd4,2-3] more active part in more fields of the social life.
Some have taken up posts in government, and some even became the governmen [fm1,-] chief [np3,s-] like Mrs. Thather.
In my opinion, a large portion of the feminists [np4,1-1] propositions are [vp3,s-] sound and useful.
They serve as pioneer [np3,3-] and ice-breaker [np3,5-] which [pr5,s-] run on the first front in the battle against the unfair social convention.
And, as a consequence, [wd4,s-] will surely bring about the bright future for the women, even, the whole human society.
However, the feminists are [wd5,2-3] also tend to be too radical in some aspects.
For examples [pp2,1-] some feminists tend to be hateful and inappropriately associate anything with the illtreatment [fm1,-] of women.
Like [wd5,s-] some suggest that all the words with "man", like "human, mankind," should have relevant "huwoman [fm1,-] womankind" in a way of equality.
Some suggest that women should be as hard and rough as men and that there should be no womanly gentle [wd2,s-] which is another kind of extreme [np6,1-] 	To sum up, feminists have contributed a great deal to the good of women.
Tribute should go to them except that they should be more objective and moderate on some terms [wd7,s-] 
(t9-7) 	According to some reports of newspaper, nowadays, more and more Battered Women Shelters are established in the world, with the purpose to give some help to the women who have suffered bad treatmeat [fm1,-] of their husbands.
Though the slogan --- men and women are equal --- has been shouted for years, unequality [fm2,-] between men and women still exists on [wd3,s-] many aspects.
For example, the graduate distribution [wd7,s-] which has to be faced by most of the university students, has become a headache to girls.
Since many companies just prefer to accept males as their staffs [np6,s-] girls stand little chance for jobs.
Graduate distribution [wd7,s-] falls into the one in which only sex is important but not students' capacity or achievement.
This also provides a reason why boys' marks in their study are alway [fm1,-] lower than girls in most universities.
 [wd4,3-] even PH.D, [wd4,5-] in U.S. universities, have to leave their careers when they are married for they have to provide a good environment for [wd4,1-2] husbands' study.
In order to change the unequal situation I suggest that feminist [np6,1-1] can do something like the followings [np6,1-] : 	Firstly, we can rely on the publicization [fm2,-] Since nowadays there are still quite a lot of people do not realize the disadvantage [wd2,1-1] condition that women are standing in, publicization [fm2,-] seems very important.
Feminists can give lectures to the public and let [vp1,-3] people aware of the existing unequality [fm2,-] in addition, feminists can set up some schools for women, just to teach them how to protect themselves by the way of law, for a lot of women just accept their fates when they suffer bad treatment.
Secondly, feminists can urge the goverments [fm1,-] to set up some practical laws for women's rights.
Most companies, for instant [wd3,1-] do not want to accept females as their staffs [np6,s-] One reason I suggested is that they have to pay the salary to women who are going to bear children and could not work.
Thus, I think that the company of the husband and that of the wife can share [vp1,-4] to pay the salary.
If such laws really put [vp7,s-] into use, women's rights can make [np7,-2] great stride.
 [cc2,s-] 	We are anxious to see any practical improvements for women's rights are [wd4,s-] coming soon.
(t9-8) 	Human [wd3,s-] is divided into two parts: Man and woman, [wd4,s-] each plays an important role in this world.
Thus there comes [vp3,s-] women's liberation compaign [fm1,-] and Feminists, who struggle for the equality with men in the Man-chauvinism [cc1,-] world.
Even in China where others believe women are equal to men, things is [vp3,1-] actually not so ideal.
For example, when a [np7,-1] enterprise goes headhiking [fm2,-] it would not hire you no matter how competent you are because you are a woman.
It would rather hire a men [np3,1-] less competent.
Such kind of phenominon [fm1,-] are [vp3,4-] not uncommon in China.
So we need a compaign [fm1,-] a reform urgently.
Yet the Feminists have done a lot: they persued [fm1,-] equality with men in economy, in society and in politics; they protested against sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place; they helped women who were victims of family violence; they opposed porn industries.
Perhaps, there exist some unproper [fm2,-] or overdone actions.
For instance, some Feminists suggested [vp1,-3] to change "history" into "herstory".
But comparing [vp5,-s-] to the good they have done, these overdones [fm2,-] are minor, and can be neglected.
Only man-chauvinist [np3,s-] considering their shaking position, will say bad words against Women's Liberation Movement.
The feminist [np3,s-] commenced their actions since the beginning of this century, in less than 100 years, the movement has influenced a fairly large part of the world.
They strive for their aim in almost every field of modern society: equality in economics, in politics and in social aspect; self-determination on matters varied [vp5,s-] from sexual [wd2,1-] to abortion and advertisment [fm1,-] 	Feminism does obtain sweet [cc4,-1] success in the fields as was [vp3,s-] stated above.
Special allowances also have been legally set for them; women's social estate has been greatly improved and their status in education, employment as well as in politics and economics have [vp3,s-] been greatly bettered.
Anyway, feminists in Britain and America, perhaps because of their too [cc4,-2] serious eagerness for their ideal, seemingly have gone to extremes in these years.
One of their famous demands is the legal and social acknowledgement for lesbian, even if this demand could be regarded as understoodable [fm2,-] how can people accept their calls of equality in Porn?
It's so ridiculous and absurd, no wonder that there are someone [np3,1-2] who say that feminists have done more harm, to the cause of women than good.
People can't help thinking whether if [wd5,s-] the feminism will change this which is called "man chauvinist" society to a "women [np3,1-] chauvinist" one?
In those areas, the voice of feminism is weak [wd4,s-] even soundless: 	Koran, the Bible of lslum [fm1,-] rules the society of [wd4,1-2] lslum [fm1,-] world.
In countries such as lran, lraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, commandments and precepts on Koran direct people's thought and made [vp6,s-] the society a complete man-absolution [fm2,-] one.
Those strict rules not only forbid women to involve in politics and economics, but also inhibit them from taking part in the usual social activities: Women are always on [wd3,-1] unemployment, women are not allowed to walk on street or show up in any public place without their black veils, women are not permitted to talk to strangers....
I wonder how's the feeling of the women [wd1,s-] there.
Have the conception of equality with men ever came [vp9,8-] into their mind?
Generally, East Asia is another region which the feminist should pay attention to (China is an exception, in this anciently historied [fm2,-] country, everything is under the doctrine of mean.
We haven't yet find [vp9,3-] any need for feminism presently).
Man-superiority has got deep roots in the society, man is the master both in and out of the home, man is responsible for all social intercourses [np5,-] man is the only back-bone of the family, man makes lives [wd3,1-5] for his wife and children.... while the woman is destined to play the role of wife to husband, mother to children and servant in the house; few chances are provided for women to develop their own career.
What target do those feminist [np3,1-] want to reach?
Perhaps, the first feminist's motive is pure [wd2,1-2] for promoting [vp1,-3] women to struggle for their social statue [wd3,s-] But, there is one important point which the first feminist neglected, that is, she and her followers did not give a definition for feminism, at least did not give a strict definition.
The feminists now just met the unforturnate [fm1,-] condition.
I mean women can do as good [ad2,2-] as men, or better than men in some fields, but not [wd4,s-2] all fields.
In fact, feminists want to surpass men in every fields [np3,1-] they even want to place themselves over men.
This surely caused [vp6,s-] many serious problems, which are difficult to solve, even for those feminists.
It is very difficult to get same salary, same number of officials in govermental [fm1,-] institutions, because the women don't have enough ability, although they have enough energy.
Feminism is also one of the reasons caused [vp5,s-] family violent [wd2,2-] We know, most feminists are female.
In most cases, men give what they want to show their generosity, while in some family [np3,2-] the number of this kind of family [np6,3-] is not small, husbands can't stand the feminists' excessive demand.
Of course, it's not only the feminists' thing [wd7,2-] men also should be responsible for it.
Here, I just point out, feminism is one of the reasons caused [bp5,s-] family violent [wd2,2-] 	Furthermore, [wd4,s-] sexual problem has been becoming more and more serious since the feminism appeared, such as, sexual harrasment [fm1,-] in work, porn, abortion, Ads [fm1,4-2] for women and its bad affection, homosexuality, etc.
Because I'm writing about feminism, so [wd5,s-] I have to think that's some feminists go beyond their legal sope [fm1,-] and partly caused [vp6,s-] these problems.
Feminism now really do [vp3,3-] harm to women, except feminists give a strict definition to the term of feminism from now.
But take [vp4,s-] everything into consideration, one must consider men and women equal.
Nowadays, many things done by men are done also by women, which is, to some extend [pp2,2-] attributed to the feminists' struggle for the equality of women.
Women have now walked out of the kitch [fm1,-] Throughout [wd4,1-1] society, capable women are proving that they are valuable to the communities.
Morer [fm1,-] the husband must now assume some of the responsibilities of maintaining a household such as cooking, cleaning and other such job around the house.
Although China was once a deeply rooted feudal countrony [fm1,-] great changes of women's social position have taken place.
A numerber [fm1,-] of social trends are combining to produce a unique shift in family relationship.
In some big cities, an increasing number of two-parent families have a woman as the source of income as well as the husband, although some poor rural areas [cc2,-s-] are still prevailling [fm2,-] the traditional pattern of men working outside while women staying at home.
It is less embarrassed [aj4,3-3] about the situation that the father shoulders part of the houshold [fm1,-] chores.
Secondly, when working, she'll meet with people from all walks of life and tackle various problems, even some hard ones, also she can learn a lot from her job, which will strengthen her will and wider [wd2,s-] her field of vision.
In conclusion, women's liberation raises women's social position and cause [vp3,s-] a variety of changes in interpersonal relationship within a family, which is good to women, but not does harm to women.
It is true that Chinese women can enjoy more priviledge [fm1,-] than women in the western society, but things are not always the case.
In characters, most Chinese character [np3,2-] with 'nu' (meaning women) as their components [np6,s-] mean evil qualities of mankind, such as 'greed' and 'wicked'.
Even Confusuis [fm1,-] the blilliant [fm1,-] thinker and educator held that "women and villains are untrustworthy".
Shortly after liberation, over 90% of the female grown-up [np3,5-] were illeterate [fm1,-] [np3,s-] or semi-illelerates [fm1,-] owing to the fact that only men can learn [vp1,-3] read and write in the old time because in the traditional concept only men can carry on the family name, they deserved all the privillege [fm1,-] in the society.
First of all, from central government to township faculty, "Women's Federation [np3,1-1] " are set up to deal with women problems specifically, such as family violence, women abuse, child abuse etc.
It is owing to this organization that China sees fewer problems with sex-discrimination than most Westen [fm1,-] countries.
It is also for this organization of this organization [wd7,s-] that the privilege and equality are trickling down to Chinese women.
There is also a slang to call the hen-pecked husband "Qi Guan Yan" (literally [wd4,s-] means tracheitis [fm1,-] while pronoucingly [fm2,-] similar to "wife controls tight").
If being called "Qi Guan Yan" means more respects are being paid to the wives in families why should the husbands [np3,s-] concern so much about his face, since a society, any society can not be regarded as a highly civilized one unless enough attention and respects are being paid to women.
Chinese success does not mean it [pr1,s-] has achieved enough to rest.
Actually, the more it achieves, the more it finds the problems [wd1,4-] Take the women in the better-off coastal cities in the south as an instance.
My women [wd7,-s-] taking the westen [fm1,-] patten [fm1,-] as a model, quit their jobs and reduce to housewives after their husbands have become millionairs [fm1,-] Some even regard it as a fashion to wear [cc3,-2] husband's surname contrasting [vp1,s-] the westen [fm1,-] feminists are struggling for the women's right [vp4,s-] be called by their own names.
Hearing this question, most people may come to this [wd3,s-] answer that a woman should be as busy as a bee in the kitchen, sweep the floor while telling the children's story and knit while humming the cradlesong.
These feminists are the champion [np3,4-] for the liberation of women from the yoke of chores.
But just as the common saying goes: "To be a woman is difficult but [wd3,s-] to be an independent woman is more difficult.
In the first place, since a woman work [vp3,2-] and is able to support herself, she becomes free to choose her marriage.
Unavoidably, they will blame each other for not supporting and understanding the other party [wd3,s-] The worse is the marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her career than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does.
Feminists have helped women shake off the traditional yoke of housework, but who will help them to lay down to [wd3,s-] heavy burden of double career [np6,2-] ?
Then when the society entered into [wd5.-] the patriarchal society, men took a leading role and this continues till now.
Yet ever since 70's, the movement of women liberation has been brought before people, particularly in the Western country [np6,4-] 	Feminists insist that women should be equal to men and women should go out to work in the society instead of staying at home taking care of the kids.
People view [vp1,-4] on this phenomenon differently.
Just staying at home looking after the kids, doing the house chores and serving the husband is not all that women can do, their wisdom and ability enable them to do much and more greater [aj3,1-] thing [np6,5-] than these, of course those house work [np3,2-] are great too.
Maybe some people worry that if women take jobs [cc3,1-] , then it will do harm to the family and it may be too much for women to take a job as well as keep the house.
It's partly due to Chinese women's hardworking [wd2,2-] yet more important is that how people view [vp1,-2] on it.
If all the people are for [pp1,s-] a woman to have her own career and give her chance, such as the government set [vp3,2-] up kindergarten [np6,2-1] where the mother can sent [vp9,1-] their kids to [wd5,s-] and then go to work at ease, and also the husband should have a hand in the house chores, then a woman can own a happy family and her own career at the same time.
If a woman just stay [vp3,4-] at home and do [vp3,s-] all the housechores [fm2,-] I'm sure she will get bored of it sooner or later.
While on the other hand, the husband goes home after a tiring day, and he maybe [fm2,1-2] too tired to talk to his wife too much about the work, to care about the housework and kids, and if he has any trouble in work he won't talk with her complaining wife for she can't understand him at all.
Yet if both the husband and wife have their career, and do the housework together, they will find it easier to communicate with each other and feel [vp1,-s-] more like that they are in the same boat.
They can share their happiness and sorrowness [fm2,-] both in work and about family together.
Due to the division of labour, men and women should cooperate with each other for both of them have their own speciality [fm1,-] General [wd2,-4] speaking, men are taking a leading role in the world, yet there are some fields that men can't take the place of women.
In the long history of human society evolution, women have been cosidered [fm1,-] to be inferior to men, except for in [wd5,2-3] the matrilineal commune.
Women had no position of their own whether inside or outside families, while men are [vp6,s-] justified to dominate the whole society.
They need not be the accesory [fm1,-] of men.
They must break away [wd4,2-3] the traditional norms that women are not match for men.
The facts prove that women have contributed a great deal to the whole society since they are equal to men as a member [np3,s-] of the society.
They can act not only the part of [wd4,2-1] daughter, wife and mother, but also the part of [wd4,3-1] secretary, teacher, minister, president and so on.
They have the ability to do a good job as long as the whole society will do away with the concept that women are stupider [aj3,-] or weaker than men.
When women walk out of the small limited circle, they will see a very broad world around her [pr3,s-] In this world, they will explore and develop their potential capability.
It undermines men's superiority and wons [fm2,-] their respect towards women.
Women are considered to be able to do only a few kind [np3,2-] of traditional jobs.
Women should have the ability to challenge other jobs, especially [wd4,s-] which are [wd5,s-] used to be men's, such as politician and scientists.
If women can't walk out their small circle and speak and act for themselves, they are more likely to be a loser [np3,7-] When children grow up, they leave their mother.
In such circumstance [np6,2-] women may take scrificication [fm1,-] into account.
As long as there are men and women in [wd3,5-2] the earth, they are equal.
(t9-16) 	A well-balanced nature, which used to be an Eden for humanity has no longer existed because humanity has regarded himself as the masters [np3,s-] of nature and has been excessively exploiting and utilizing natural resources without considering the consequnces [fm1,-] that will follow, let alone paying any attention to nature's calling.
In order to develop industries and build housing estate, mankind constantly cuts down trees at will, exploits prairie [np6,1-] and primative [fm1,-] forest without reconstruction [wd2,1-1] them, or even removes a whole hill for some aim.
For the purpose of chasing profits, they hunt and kill immense [cc4,-2] wild animals.
Worsely [fm2,-] people even destroy nature carelessly: deposit litter freely, release the waste even harmful residue and water into the rivers and discharge black poisonous smoke into the air.
Residents in some areas with river passing by will suffer from serious shortage of drink [wd2,1-] water because the river has been aggravatingly pollutted [fm2,-] and covered with floating rubbish.
In the countrysides [np5,-] the placid pastoral life and tranquil environment have been damaged in line with the invasion of modern industries.
The fresh atmosphere has been pollutted [fm2,-] and the clean streams are covered by the waste residue and water.
Bad hygiene [wd2,1-1] conditions are the commonly existing components [wd7,s-] in rural areas.
Soil erosion, desertification, salinisation-alkalinisation [fm2,-] and land degradation emerge, which also worsen the disasters like droughts and floods.
Besides, a tendency of increasing temperature and less rainfall stem [vp3,s-] from the destruction of massive grassland and forest, which also cause [vp3,s-] the changable [fm2,-] climate.
It is estimated that in the future our decendents [fm2,-] can only appriciate [fm1,-] regretly [fm2,-] the beautiful rare wildlife like tiger and red-crowned crane in pictures because they are now becoming extinct.
People nowadays realize how wrong they have done to nature and begin to take pratical [fm1,-] actions to protect environment.
Measures are taken to stop the vicious cycle of exhaustion of rescources [fm1,-] and the deterioration of the environment.
Mankind tries to remodify [fm1,-] and co-ordinate the relationship between humanity and nature by saving natural rescources [fm1,-] controlling birthrate, promoting moderate consumption, implementing overall adjustment and control and restoring the ecology.
A world-wide champaign [fm1,-] of environmental protection popularizes [vp1,s-] and more and more people join the issue.
People contrive and manufacture rescource-saving [fm1,-] products and search for clean energy source.
The concept of envionmental [fm1,-] protection even roots in the young generation.
People consciously control their behaviours that may do harm to nature, lessen [vp1,-3] using plastical [fm2,-] bags or other products that may pollute envionment [fm1,-] 	Meanwhile, people reconstruct environment by afforestation and purifying water rescources [fm1,-] Some places which used to be garbage receptacles now become beautiful scenes.
Some large-scale banks and companies invest numerous [np8,-1] capital to save the pollutted [fm2,-] rivers and scenery spots.
Nuclear-power stations have been built and put into use, replacing the conventional, heavily pollutted [fm2,-] coal-power station.
All these not only protect the enviornment [fm1,-] but also beautify our survival surroundings for a better life.
(t9-17) 	I am not a feminist but I totally approve [vp1,-s-] those actions taken by the feminists to protect women and to seek equal status with men, because in varying degrees, women in the world are in a lower position than men and treated unfairly.
For example, in China, girls are always at a disadvantageous position of enrollement [fm1,-] for primary schools, middle-schools and even universities.
It's an undeniable fact that women's intelligence is commonly dispised [fm1,-] and ignored.
Imagine what a loss to human being [np6,2-1] if we couldn't have Mrs. Curie's great contibution [fm1,-] Women surely also have ability (if not equally great) to promote human development.
Feminists [np4,s-] fight for women' equal opportunity to gain education is undoubtably [fm2,-] wise and beneficial.
The girl graduates are always less populor [fm1,-] no matter how hard they have worked through all these years, no matter how [wd3,-2] good marks they have achieved, only because their opponents are boys who were born to have the merit endowed by god [fm3,s-] And women also have to struggle for equal payment for the same amount of work.
What on earth [ad1,s-] good does this social unfairness brings to human [np6,s-] ?
The whole draging [fm1,-] of human development?
These social phenomenons [fm1,-] often trouble me.
But [wd4,s-] women in some regions have more miserable fate even shock me vehemently.
In Islamic countries, women have to wear veils all the time and wear long rob [fm1,-] letting [wd3,-] no part of body being seen by public [np7,1-] Women have no right to vote, to have their own profession, to take roles in the sports games.
It seems that in Islamic countries, women's human [wd5,1-1] bodies are regarded as indecency.
While in some regions of [wd3,1-1] Africa, a woman have [vp3,2-] to wear rings around their [pr3,s-] neck from a little girl [wd7,s-] and add [vp3,s-] rings every year so as to make the neck longer and longer.
When human [np6,1-1] is striking through all these centuries for development, this problem became [vp6,s-] more and more outstanding.
They have gain [vp9,2-] some rights for women through years
Thanks to the feminists who have taken the lead to break through the outmoded convention, the position of women nowadsys [fm1,-] has ranked almost paralell [fm1,-] to that of men.
Nowadays, women live much happier lives than those of [wd5,-] long ago.
They are respected and served by men in conventional circles where they enjoy [vp1,-3] together at conversation, games and amusements.
They are no longer left at home by their husbands to look after their children and their in-laws [wd4,s-] to manage the house chore.
If given more opportunities, they can do more contribution [cc3,2-] to the society.
Although nowadays that old custom has been changed [wd4,s-] lot, to some extent, it still has some negative effect.
At the present time, many women have become professionalists [fm2,-] A women [np3,1-] with high standard of education occupies herself with a profession, however, most of the time she would work on an employment with a salary which does not match up to her knowledge and qualification.
And her children need her discipline and guidance to form good, healthy charater [fm1,-] But what about the woman herself, if a woman with qualification and efficioncy [fm1,-] wouldn't be engaged in a profession, her knowledge acquired through several years of hard study would be wasted, I think it is unfair.
Under such circumstance, feminists declaim [vp1,-s-] that women should be respected and be treated equally in every area.
They fight [wd4,-] equivalent rights [cc3,1-] for women.
I believe that in future women can aquire [fm1,-] rights that men have.
As time passed bit by bit, men came into power in a society little by little, and now in such an industrial society, it seems men are dominator [np3,2-1] in any fields [np6,1-] Thus feminism came into being in order to obtain equal rights with men.
Let's look at the following facts that will confirm my opinion that women, with the help of "feminists", are living in even poor [aj3,2-1] situation.
Well, such a woman should be both a capable housewife and an energy [wd2,1-1] boss.
In a man-dominating feminism [wd2,s-] (I mean the idea or thought of that is controled [fm2,-] by men) movement, the situation can be easily interpreted as "she has traditional female virtue as well as modern ideas to be equal with men".
But in my opinion that cannot be called "equal" and is overbear [vp9,1-2] for women.
Another fact is that feminism have [vp3,s-] doubled the market of cigarette.
I don't think it is a good habit to smoke heavily, as we all know that smoking do [vp3,s-] a great harm [np5,2-] to our health.
Only men [wd3,s-] smoking is "bad" enough; women, demanding the same as men and joining such [wd4,1-2] smoking trend, is worse [wd7,s-] .
I cite it only to prove that it [wd4,s-] unnecessary to equalize everything.
Now the error is that men is [vp3,1-] dominating the society.
Even some women regarded [vp6,d] themselves inferior to men and can't understand why feminists want to be equal with superior men.
The tradition has existed for a long time and is very forceful, But feminists' persistence has set a good example to women and encourges [fm1,-] them to be courageous and persistent.
Besides educating women, feminists have been leading them to show women's anger towards the unequality [fm2,-] in terms of strikes and demonstration, which have been very forceful and effective.
Lots of women have come out of their kitchens and have jobs in many fields such as politics, financial [wd2,3-3] sports and even astronomy which were dominated by men before.
We should not forget that feminists have brought benifit [fm1,-] to not only the cause of women, but also the cause of men.
Women are more equal [aj3,1-] with [wd3,4-1] men, which results in better communication.
Now female political leaders are not a rare thing as we see that [wd4,3-3] former British prime minister Tharcher [fm1,-] is a well-known woman politician.
Some people' [np4,1-1] belief that politics belongs to men is no longer accepted by both men and women since many facts have proved this belief wrong.
For example, teacher [wd3,-s-] seems to be one of the favourite professions for women.
(t9-2) 	As the social [wd2,2-1] develops Feminism becomes one of the social phenomena.
What the feminists advocate is to improve the women's social status, make the women release [vp4,3-4] from the heavy housework and make the women have an equal opportunity to go to social [wd2,2-2] with man, and so on.
In a word, feminists think the men and the women is [vp3,2-] equal.
On the one hand, the phenomena reflect [vp1,-s-] that thoughs [fm1,-] of the women has been liberate [vp9,2-] [vp1,2-2] [cc5,-2] more furtherly [ad3,1-] [fm2,-] than before.
On the other hand, the thoughs [fm1,-] has done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In anciet [fm1,-] the [np7,2-3] women were consider [vp9,1-] as the humble classes [np6,s-] and machine of giving birth to children, the [np7,s-] women are [vp6,s-] inferior to men.
For example the women were prevented from taking part in the anciet [fm1,-] Olympic Sports.
Now the [np7,s-s-] women become an essential part of social [wd2,1-] The [np7,s-1] women not only can take [vp2,-2] part of the social action concerning political, economic, [wd4,-3] culture's [wd2,-2] field [np6,1-] the women [wd5,s-] but also can became [vp9,1-] managers, drivers, teachers, and so on.
At present, social [wd2,-1] can't provide equal opportunity of employ [wd2,1-] with [vp2,5-5] the [np7,-] men to the [np7,-] women in a certain captimism's [fm1,-] [wd2,-1] country.
Nevthless [fm1,-] the phenomena are less.
While the completely equal [wd2,2-1] between the men and the women is out of the question First, the physical differnce [fm1,-] is existence [cc3,1-] On a [wd3,1-1] whole the [wd5,-1] men are strong, the [wd5,-1] women are weak, which lead the men to become the embodiment of strenghth [fm1,-] and make the men be equal to the heavy physical work [cc1,8-] nevthless [fm1,-] the [wd5,-1] women can't do it.
Secondly the [wd5,-1] wen [fm1,-] usually are bravery [wd2,1-] and confidence [wd2n3-] the [wd5,-1] women are tender and cautions [wd2,4-] The characterises [wd2,1-1] of the wen [fm1,-] make the men be prone to work in the social [wd2,1-1] and the women stay at home to look after the children.
If the men tend for [wd3,1-4] the child other than the women.
Which neither [wd1,s-] embodies the advantage of the men nor embodies the advantage of the women.
 [wd7,s-] In a word, the distinguish [wd2,1-1] between the men and the women in social act [np6,2-l] is only social's [wd2,-1] difference [wd2,-1] distribution rather than discriminate [wd2,s-] the women.
To some extent, the opinion which feminists emphasis [wd2,1-1] on is at the cost of the women's health.
Beause [fm1,-] the women's power is limit [wd2,1-] in contrast with the men's power For example, the women [np4,1-2] world's [np4,2-1] champion of runing [fm2,-] 100m must [vp9,-] ran more slowly [ad3,-] than the men's world champion.
If people consider the [wd5,-1] wen [fm1,-] and the [wd5,-1] women as the same as feminists describe, the [wd5,-1] women will undertake the [wd5,-3] [cc3,1-2] more impression from the social [wd2,2-1] and theirself [fm2,-] It will enfluence [fm1,-] the women's health in a long term, [wd4,s-] what is more, minize [fm1,-] the men's effect on the faimly [fm1,-] and the social [wd2,1-] It is against what the feminists wish.
Therefore, the view of feminists isn't [vp9,4-1] deserve standing absolutely.
About [ad1,s-] in the 1970's, feminists turn up [vp6,s-] in the advanced western countries.
But contrary to our common sense, feminists were usually male other [wd3,4-2] than female.
Feminists initiated the women movement to fight up [wd5,1-1] against those old-fashioned traditional concepts, and appealed to the society for men and women's equality.
In the first [wd4,3-] social division of labour is different, and men and women have different ability.
Many kinds of jobs, especialy [fm1,-] those jobs which need strength, don't suit to [vp2,1-] women.
Although the society is advancing rapidly, many jobs tend to need wisdom other than strength, we still think so, for men and women have distinguishing [wd3,-] physiological characteristics.
Women are superior at imagination, language, memory and feelings, but men are good at mathatics [fm1,-] physics, operation, and so on.
If we could let men and women engage in [vp1,1-6] what jobs most suit to each other, this kind of rational division of labour would do good to the social advancement.
In the second [wd4,3-] the name of women is titled [fm2,1-] by [wd5,6-2] 'the weak'.
Women are like bird [np6,3-] but men are like tree [np6,3-] Bird [np6,-2] should hide under [wd3,-4] the shade of tree [np6,1-2] to avoide [fm1,-] the strong sunlight.
Feminists' opinions encourage women to compare with men [vp1,2-5] in all sorts of ways.
We often run across such situation [np6,1-] : a woman possesses money and success of enterprise [cc1,2-] but in [wd3,-2] the same time loses her feminine qualities and doesn't look lovely as before.
She gets married late, and [wd3,s-] even becomes a spinster.
In essence, feminism is the mainly [wd2,-1] reason for such tragedy.
In their opinions, women don't need to rely on men, women can earn enough money to support themself [fm2,-] women should work hard at their work, women can become manager [np6,3-] scientist [np6,s-] and even president [np6,s-] We couldn't say the view is wrong, but women's cause also include [vp3,3-] helping men with their enterprises, bringing up children.
It is women's responsibity [fm1,-] to bring birth a new life [cc3,4-] to the world.
If all the women gave up houswork [fm1,-] to climb along the career ladder, what would happen to the world?
The family would break up frequently, divorce should happen, and the society would be unstable, then women couldn't get truly liberated When God makes man and woman, he expects them to help each other rather than fight up [wd5,1-3] against each other.
(t9-4) 	In most countries, feminist [np6,-2] have strugled [fm1,-] for the right for many years.
Today, many women are going into professions, such as medicine, low [fm1,-] engineering [wd4,s-] even police [cc1,4-] They comprise a large part of the workers in business and factories, and, in addition, they are working up to important jobs which used to be held predominantly by men.
There are [vp3,-3] even some business which are [vp3,2-] run completely by women in some countries.
But these have rised [fm2,-] [wd3,s-] the satues [fm1,-] of women indeed?
In plain terms, women such as china [fm3,3-] [cc1,3-] work hard.
and [fm3,-s-] for the most part, they are [wd5,1-3] get equal pay for equal work.
Because women [wd4,1-2] prodominant [fm1,-] in the low-paying fields, they receive, actually, less money than man [np6,6-] In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to positions of leadership even in professions they dominant [wd2,1-3] in some countries, such as Russia.
Although men comprise only 15 percent of all [wd4,1-1] people involved in helth [fm1,-] care, they [wd3,-s] are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervisors, and administrators.
Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm management [wd3,s-] 	in [fm3,-s-] the [wd5,1-1] addition, feminist [np6,-1] is not to relieve the burden of women, on the countrary [fm1,-] inurese [fm1,-] it.
Although women enter professions, they should do nearly all the housework in plain minds [wd7,2-] They are not only earning the money, but also watching the children washing.
They have to prepare dinner, have to wash the plates and so [wd4,-] .
So we can say "faminist [fm1,-] [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of women than good".
(t9-5) 	On account of history, some western countries such as America, England, and Iceland, have always an advanced culture in physically [wd2,1-] [wd7,s-] It makes a good chance for women in these countries to have a good education.
The women in these countries always lead a life comfortable [wd1,2-] and wealth [wd2,5-] In physically [wd2,1-] they have almost melt [vp9,1-] Good education makes them have an intensive self-sense [wd7,2-] In some respects, they appeal for personality libration [fm1,-] strongly.
But whatever [wd3,s-] the woman [np3,s-1] work hard [wd1,s-] at their cause, they always have run [vp6,s-] up against a few serious roadblocks in their successful road [cc1,1-] In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to [wd4,1-2] position of leadership in professions they dominate.
At last, in order to obtain their rights, they alway [fm1,-] have a feminist.
Although they have many reason [np3,1-] to do this, in general, in my view, feminist [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.
Though this is the world that man is advantagous [fm1,-] over women, in general, the society still advocate [vp3,4-] equality between man and woman.
The socity [fm1,-] have [vp3,2-] given several "the lady first" conditions for women because of [wd4,2-2] differences both man and woman.
But [wd4,1-2] feminist emplisises [fm1,-] woman's right too much.
I think it is extreme [wd4,-] Let's suppose, once the feminist would success [wd2,1-] The woman [np3,s-1] have full rights to let man [np3,s-] serve [vp2,2-2] for them.
The men hate woman [np3,3-] and don't help them.
It will [wd4,1-2] more harm to the cause of woman [np3,s-] than good.
This is one hand [wd7,3-] 	On the other hand There are great differences in physiology between man and woman.
For the woman, they are more fit [aj3,1-] for [wd4,1-2] family than woman [wd3,s-] [wd4,-2] Feminist over-emphsises [fm1,-] woman's political rights, and ignores act's [np4,1-1] in their family.
The sociaty [fm1,-] would be out of order.
The woman couldn't go in for their cause with soul and heart [wd1,3-] This would be great harm to women's cause.
In conclusion, feminist [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.
(t9-6) 	Some people mind [wd3,s-] that the women's movement has brought about [vp1,s-] the [wd5,s-] women more harmness [fm2,-] than goodness [wd3,s-] but I think, the women's movement do [vp3,3-] to the women more good than harm.
Before the women's movement women were considered following cultural tradition to be the best or most "natural" parents and were given [vp7,s-] custody of the children.
The leaders of [wd4,2-1] movement are mainly college-educated women.
In few short [cc4,1-1] years, they caused American society to start reexamining itself, influenced the government to pass antidiscrimination lows [fm1,-] in hiring and increased their following [wd7,2-] 	Women's liberation is surely to take place.
The most practical goals of the movement were [vp6,s-s-] to gain job equalities in pay and promotions, because people seem to feel that women's work is inherently unequal to men's.
For women can being [vp9,1-] free [vp9,s-] for [vp1,s-1] work outside the home, the women's movement has called for more child-care centres.
These changes in the family life-styles would more equally [ad3,1-] socialize boys and girls and would decrease sex-role difference.
But the fact is, more and more women worked [vp6,s-] and the working wives are much more optimistic about job roles.
The second is that women working outside the home are less likely to have happy, stable marriages than housewives, this means that her [pr3,s-] job has a bad effect on her [pr3,s-] marriage.
On the other hand, because the leaders of the movement don't know well the condition of low-educated [cc4,1-1] women, their actions sometimes are not practically [wd2,2-2] and unreasonable, sometimes they go too far away [wd4,2-3] the practical life, those [wd7,s-] bring the women harmness [fm2,-] But those [wd7,d] are not mainly [wd2,2-] 	On the whole, the women's movement bring [vp3,2-] the equality to the women.
So I mind [wd3,s-] the Feminists have done more good to the women than harm.
Feminists has [vp3,1-] grown rapid [wd2,s-] these years.
In fact, I think the men and women should be equal in position of society, in human rights and personality, also in equal [wd5,s-] paying for equal job.
But the leaders of feminists emphasis [wd2,s-] these too much.
They think women should rise to positions of leadership in every areas [np6,1-] even in some what [pr5,s-] they couldn't do well.
As a [wd5,1-1] women, they have their own characters different from men They do things carefully, they are warm-hearted, but they have limited physical and mental vitality.
Some works [np5,s-] are fit for them to do and others not.
They couldn't have much time and energy to do heavy work, nomatter [fm2,1-] [wd4,2-4] in physical or in mental vitality.
You can find those women insisting on feminists [wd3,s-] always end the day mentally and physically exhausted.
Being an ordinary person [np3,s-] they could also do things which they care for in their spare time.
(t9-8) 	Feminists have strugled [fm1,-] for women's right in the [wd5,1-2] most countries for many years, and it has brought some right which only men can [vp6,-2] have before, for example, the women in the [wd5,1-2] many countries can do the same job as men, go to school and enter politics.
Do these make [vp1,-6] the situation of women to rise [cc3,5-] indeed?
As we know, women hadn't been allowed [vp6,s-] to work for few [wd5,s-] thousands of years, such as china [fm3,s-] in which the fedlism [fm1,-] has more than 2000 years of history, the concept [np6,s-] which Kongzi and Mengzi established have posses [wd3,s-] the main situation in many people's brain [cc1,4-] In that [pr3,-1] days, me [pr4,s-] [pr1,s-s-] held the seat of power [cc1,2-] Women was [vp3,1-] thought [vp1,s-] that they could only stay at home and do housework,they must be ruled by men.
It would be normal of [wd3,s-] a man hitted [fm2,-] a women [np3,1-] but conversely, if a man was striked [fm2,-] by a women [np3,1-] that women [np3,1-] would be denounced, even punished.
Although it is known by every people [cc4,1-] that the [wd5,1-4] man [np3,-2] and women is [vp3,5-] equal, furtherly [fm2,-] ensured by law but [wd5,s-] the traditional concept is very difficult to be changed competely [fm1,-] and rapidly.
Some women in the professions consider working an honor and a privilege, but they don't abtain [fm1,-] the same right as men, although they can enter proffessions [fm1,-] such as medicine, architecture, and teacher they couldn't rise to [wd4,2-4] position of prestige more easily.
In practice, it is very difficult, even in proffessions [fm1,-] they dominate.
In the soviet [fm3,2-1] Union, although men comprise only 15 percent of all people involved in health care, they [wd3,s-] are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervistors [fm1,-] and ministrators [fm1,-] Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm magagement [wd7,s-] And, although most factory worker [np3,2-l] are women, the foreman would likely be a man.
In the [pp2,1-1] addition, Femisnits [fm1,-] is [vp3,1-] not to relieve the burden of women, but to increase it.
for the women entering [vp4,s-s-] proffessions [fm1,-] they not only watches [vp3,3-] the children, but also do cooking, washing.
they [fm3,s-] are often involved in many trifles of their family.
After the working is over, men may go home and have a rest, but they [pr1,s-] can't.
they [fm3,s-] have to prepare dinner for her [pr3,s-] familsies' [fm1,-] and they must get to [vp2,1-] earlier than their husband for breakfast.
According to these, the situation of the women hasn't risen [cc1,6-] indeed, and we expect that condition of the women's could be improved in the future.
The programme of action involves items concerning women's vital interests such as: sharing rights at different levels, participating equally in making political and economic decisions, enjoying equal pay for equal work to [wd3,s-] male workers, women's education and health care, elimination of violence towards women.
etc [wd5,s-] 	The representatives pointed out that the World Women's Conference should be coordinated with the World Conference of Human Rights and the World Population and Development meeting which are to be held within two years.
Women's problems can be taken seriously enough and particularly undertaken [cc2,s-] only when they are brought into other important international conferences.
Many deputies emphasized the importance for women to participate in various fields' decision: women must become fully equal citizens, taking [wd4,1-3] active part in lives of all walk [wd1,4-] and take responsibility for their society's and the world's future.
Deputies from developing countries universally placed emphasis on [wd4,1-3] urgency of solving these problems: women's poverty, education and health care, especially for peasant women, old women, disabled women and women migrants and refugees.
While women refugees suffering from chaos by wars are more likely to fall [vp1,-1] victim.
Since the whole world become [vp3,3-] more and more serious on the issue of women's position.
Therefore, all the newly-born babies seem to be equal to each other, but their futures are heavily influenced by their individual family background, social background and one's personal efferts [fm1,-] that is the reason why some of them are more likely to have opptunities [fm1,-] than others, and they are easy to reach their goals.
With or without great personal efferts [fm1,-] which is the implication of George Orwell's statement --- "Some are more equal than others.
" 	When a baby first comes to this world, he/she knows nothing about our world, but something destine [wd2,1-1] will happen to him/her so that he cannot avoid them even though he/she wants to change them.
For example, [wd4,-2] complexion is a character of a nation, people with different complexions should be equal as they are all live creatures created by the [wd5,1-1] God, but things are not always as what we had [vp6,s-] imagined.
there [fm3,s-] is still a long distance between the real society and the ideal model of the laws.
Even in the same country, people with the same complexion also differ a lot in acquiring opptunities [fm1,-] and carrying out their rights.
On the other hand, family background plays an important role in one's realization of ego [cc1,2-] For example, every university graduate should be equal, then equal opptunities [fm1,-] can be awarded to them to get a commonly desired job, but in fact, those who have better family background are more likely to get the job no matter whether they are more capable or not than others, which is one of the phenomena metioned by George Orwell --- Some are more equal than others.
But the most important factor in one's life is one's personal striving and struggling, which makes him/her "more equal" [aj3,1-] than others no matter what social and family background he/she has.
Obviously, the process of reaching the destination requires more efferts [fm1,-] and endurance, maybe, those who have no family background will fail several times more than those who have in the whole process [wd7,-] they should endure the failures and never be disappointed to realize their egoes [fm2,-] [cc3,2-] With those great efferts [fm1,-] their futures are promising.
Once they succeed, they will be given more opptunities [fm1,-] as we always give more to those who have much and take away from those who have little [wd7,s-] thus their prevails [vp4,s-] over others will remain and affect [vp1,-2] a lot for a long time.
Then, they are "more equal" [aj3,1-] than others.
So, everyone should struggle from [wd3,s-] him/herself, especially for [wd5,s-] those without good family background.
Only with striving and great efferts [fm1,-] can we make ourselves "more" equal to others.
I think feminists have done good to women themselves and [wd4,s-] society, to some extend [pp2,2-] to family and children.
They were men's accessorise [fm1,-] First they must abide by their fathers; then be faithful to their husbands.
Especially in feudal China, women smiled with mouthes [fm2,-] closed; they never dare to go out of their houses alone.
So slave and feudal societies were backward and poor, while capital [wd2,-3] and social [wd3,-1] societies developed very quickly.
To some extend [pp2,2-] it's due to women's emacipation [fm1,-] Some jobs do need to be done by women.
Fact [np6,s-] proves that women not only [wd1,s-] can do it, but also can do it well.
Especially [ad2,s-] Chinese female athletes win more honor for their motherland.
Why can't fathers and mothers take care of Children [fm3,s-] together?
Meanwhile double income will make family [np6,2-3] live a rich, happy and comfortable life.
I think women's emacipation [fm1,-] is unavoidable.
Someone says: "Feminism do [vp3,1-1] more harm to the society than good", which I don't fully agree to.
Only themselves [pr4,s-] are important.
Some other women feel like [pp1,1-5] that their life is complete only when they are at men's side.
I don't understand why some people say that feminism do [vp3,2-3] more harm to the society than good.
This is the reason that [pr51-] some people say that feminism do [vp3,2-3] more harm to the society than good.
In history, or rather his story, man tyies [fm1,-] to put forward a satisfactory answer One incarnation of woman, in man's eyes, may be Pandora, who was a union of beauty and evil, stupidity and temptation.
She opened the forbidden box and brought plaques [wd3,s-] and unhapiness [fm1,-] to mankind.
In order to control the dangerous opposite sex, man [np6,s-] either grabs a whip as what Nicher said, or convinces woman [np6,s-] that as a rib of the Adams, she is intellectually inferior and physically weaker.
They believe that women are individuals as men, they should have roles separet [fm1,-] from those of wife and mother as men do.
One of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, even boldly attacked what she called the male bias [np2,-1] of [wd3,3-1] Bible, and published her " Women's Bible".
Surely such radical ideas as well as the extrem [fm1,-] language would be hotly debated.
That is why some people stronly [fm1,-] critisized [fm1,-] [vp1,-s-] [vp6,s-s-] that feminism has done great [aj3,2-2] harm than good to the cause of women.
Believe it or not, it is a fact that girls this day are much more happier and freer than their mother or grandmother, although they still confront some problems such as less oppertunities [fm1,-] of employement [fm1,-] than boys, smaller pay and limited scale of career, and abortion etc.
When women realized maternity, the biological role of them has troditionally [fm1,-] been regarded as their major social role, and the law written by men who were stongly [fm1,-] influenced by that stereotype turned out unfaveralb [fm1,-] and unequal to them, they began to fight for vote and for the chances to be legislators.
After a long period of struggle, in June 1919, U.S. Congress finally passed the women's suffage [fm1,-] bill and the 19th Amendment to the constitution became law on Aug.26 1920.
Some 25 million women in U.S. had [vp6,s-] won the right to vote.
 [wd4,-3] Same victory had [vp6,s-] been gained in Great Britain and other parts of the [wd5,2-1] Europe later.
In China, the New Cultural movement [fm3,s-] also brought a sort of emacipation [fm1,-] to women.
In 1966, Betty Eridan, the auther [fm2,-] of the famous "Feminine Mystique" organized the National Organization for Women ( NOW )in U.S., it agitated for such improvements as child-care for professional women who wanted to work.
They also lectuered [fm1,-] lobbied in congress, and filed legal suits against sex discrimination.
For example, does the equality means the end of the the [wd6,1-] family and home?
Is it possible for women and men [vp4,s-] live in peace?
" There is a [np7,-1] old chinese [fm3,2-1] saying, which goes like "more and less are equally bad", it is quite important for feminists [vp4,s-] pay much attention to the limit of their efforts.
In my opinion, it is insensible to hold such an attitude, as we can conclude from the analysis of the present conditions of the feminism [wd2,1-1] movement.
As we all know, through the persistant [fm1,-] struggling of all these years, feminism has alrealy [fm1,-] gone a long way towards success.
Women begin to cut [vp2,1-2] smart figures in all fields.
There are more and more successful woman [np3,-1] scientists, artists, journalists, and even politists [fm2,-] in recent years.
For example, in the past, women in many countries were forbidden to take activities which made them appear in public, especially in muslim [fm3,1-1] countries.
But now, even in these muslim [fm3,1-1] countries, there are several woman [np3,-2] political leaders, and they are doing a good job.
However, in today's China, people feel natural if they know that some [np9,-1] woman divorces her husband because it is well-known that women have already had the right to choose their companion.
In Turky [fm1,-] where women were always forbidden to show any part of their body except eyes in public occasions [wd5,2-] women are adopting some western custume [fm1,-] to beautify themselves.
Whenever new-born things mad [fm1,-] their appearences [fm2,-] there is always great pain.
Women have to deal with a series of new problems as soon as they get their long-aspired [fm2,-] freedom and rights.
They now have their right to work, but at the same time the privilege of women are [vp3,3-2] also deprived of.
In the past, women enjoy [vp6,3-] much convenience when having child [np6,1-] Nowadays, women are given [vp1,s-] [vp7,-] [cc2,s-s-] to know that they must take responsibility as man do [vp3,2-] Thus their maternity leave becomes as short as possible.
In [wd4,s-] society, they are not in a position to be protected and taken care of by men, but they have to take care of themselves now.
They are the troubles whose solvement [fm2,-] will lead to success, because the essence of feminism is perfectly correct.
Through this movement, human beings will make a [np7,1-1] important step towards equality.
Regarding long-term happiness, we will undoutedly [fm1,-] choose feminists as our pioneers to make benifit [fm1,-] for women and for human beings.
First, feminists appeal for eqality [fm1,-] between man and woman, ignoring social divisions.
But many are in nature the speciality [fm1,-] of women.
But feminists have the prejudice that [wd4,s-] society offers unequal chance and right for man and woman [pp1,3-] namely [wd4,s-] society favours man instead of woman.
What's more, women tend to have advantage over man [np6,6-] Maybe in the future man will launch a movement of man's emancipation.
It will do nothing good to [wd4,s-] society but to waste [vp4,s-] time and money.
(t10-1) Two hundred years ago, some distinguished people brought forth on the North American continent, a new nation, dedicated [cc3,-3] to the proposition that all men are created equal.
In a sense, we might say that, all men are equal, but some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Because we belong to the same species, we are [wd4,1-1] same, we are equal.
All of us live on the earth and shone [vp7,s-] by the sun.
For a long time, black people served as slaves while white people who are [vp6,s-] slave-owners enjoyed wealth without working.
For a long time, women were deprive [vp9,2-] [vp1,2-5] the right of being educated, and, in some Arabian countries, they were forced to cover their face with veil when going out.
According to the law, diplomats, who was [vp3,2-] [vp6,s-s-] convicted of murder in the [np7,s-2] foreign country, are free from punishment.
There can be no doubt that, some people are really more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The attractive goal of equality have [vp3,5-] not yet been achieved.
Because he is [wd4,2-1] president, and [wd5,s-] he is more equal [aj3,1-] than you.
Beause [fm1,-] he is [wd4,2-1] president, he can exercise a power of veto of the decrees while you can just obey.
In the United States, only those who are backed up by millionares [fm1,-] could probably be elected as the candidate [np3,s-] for president [wd3,s-] So men of means are more equal [aj3,1-] than you.
At present, negroes [fm3,-] in South Africa and some other places still suffered [vp6,s-] from discrimination and segregation.
In America, citizens of colors [np5,2-] tend to have less oportunity [fm1,-] of accessing the higher social class.
Because they are judged by their color of skin but not their content [wd7,d]  In conclusion, in a sense all men are equal.
But in fact, some are really more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
There are always some who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The customs knew, but did not check [wd3,-] them.
Because they had power plus money, they were more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The smugglers met less trouble by securing the power protection [cc1,1-] .
He can never hope to possess that enormous sums [np3,s-] of money to run the presidential election.
He is more equal [aj3,1-] than those who have not.
The most [aj1,-s-] they get is to be expelled.
They are more equal [aj3,1-] than others before the law.
Those clever animals, or somebody else, creat [fm1,-] the usage --- more equal, [aj3,1-] knowing that they are smearing the innocent word.
 [aj3,1-] But now I know more.
(the "more" here is not the "more" in "more equal" [aj3,1-] ) [pr1,-] It reminds me of somebody, or to be exactly [wd2,2-] some country.
Before it got independence, freedom and equality, it exclaimed to the whole world that it would struggle for them [pr1,s-s-] at any price.
It succeed [vp6,1-] and became a young and powerful country.
But now its greedy heart said [vp6,4-] to itself that it wanted [vp6,s-] more, maybe at the very begining [fm2,-] it said so, we don't know It wanted [vp6,s-] more rights, or another word "more equal [aj3,1-] ".
It wanted [vp6,s-] to be equal in using other countries' natural resources as those countries themselves.
And it also wanted [vp6,s-] to be equal in governing other countries as their own governments.
That's what "more equal [aj3,1-] " means.
It caused [vp6,s-] the world-wide condemnation.
And now it had got [vp6,s-] what it deserved as it's rewarding [wd7,s-] and I think I needn't point out its name, let it become the history and let's forget it.
The arroundings [fm1,-] are repeating the same story in various ways.
Even from a single person we can see the shadow of "more equal" [aj3,1-] The most common "more equal [aj3,1-] " are [vp3,5-] corruption.
Some high government officials make full use of their rights to be "more equal [aj3,1-] ".
They live in villas and when they go out they use cars, their sons or daughts [fm1,-] also share the "more equality" to make more money.
It's unfair and dangerous, "government of the people, by the people and for the people" should be the most just [aj3,2-] and honest government.
Because life to everybody is a hard work, composed of laugh [np6,2-2] and tears But the latter one is much more than the former.
So be kind to others as well as to oneself [wd3,s-] Struggle for one's equality, and when you enjoy it don't forget to treat others equally.
Someone just cannot bear [vp1,-s-] that sun shines on everybody.
We should remember: we are equal, no one is less equal, and no one is more equal [aj3,1-] 
(t10-4) Equality has been long saught [fm1,-] after ever since mankind was conscious of its indispensibility [fm2,-] as one of the nuclei of human rights.
Human beings long for equality which they believe [wd4,s-] destined.
This can be best examplified [fm1,-] by that notable Declaration of Indepence [fm1,-] in 1774 in which the fourteen Bristish [fm1,-] colonies in North America advanced the idea as to [pp1,1-5] all men are created equal.
History has seen too many tragedies in which devotees of equality fall victims to the antithetic forces mounted by those frantic authoritarians who cling to the notion that still some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than the other [pr3,7-] if they will agree that all men are equal at all.
This is the notion reflected in one of George Orwell's book [np6,4-] : The Animal Farm.
He preached that some were more equal [aj3,1-] than the other [pr3,7-] in the quaint hope of cooling down the mounting furiousness of the mass.
The answer will never be consent [cc4,5-] as long as there are the rich among the majority [cc1,-1] poor.
With this respect [pp2,2-] equality can just be a good wish for all concerned and some people in certain corners of the globe still has [vp3,s-] to face discrimination; be content with oppression, and wallow in despair.
Let the world grant them a wish for the best: be equal at last --- one divinist [fm2,-] thing World has not possessed.
(t10-5) After the liberation, the Chinese people became the host [np3,5-] of the country.
But I would like to say that in China today, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Though the Chinese Communist Party had made great resolution [np6,2-] to root out the leader's abusing their power, the problem is till very serious.
They make good us [fm1,-] of their privilege to get what they want.
Suppose you are the head of the institute you'd better not to infringe upon their privileges if you don't want to meet the trouble [cc3,2-] I learn that in the Silk Corperation [fm1,-] of the Foreign Trade Committee in Dong Guang city, there is about half of the stuff [wd3,s-] who are the leader's [np6,s-] families or relatives.
The leadership of the corperation [fm1,-] have to find some work to be done by them.
Then, it comes out that a work [np5,1-] which should be done by one person was divided into 3 parts and done by 3 persons.
On the country [fm1,-] if you were a common people, even you had college certification, and you are [vp8,s-] exactly the company [np4,1-1] need, it would still be very difficult for you to enter [vp1,s-] into it.
So, the leaders and their relatives are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The second cause of unequality [fm2,-] is: money.
Suppose you had a child who were at the age of 3 or 4, and should go to kindergarton [fm1,-] Of course, it's quite normal that every parent want [vp3,2-] [vp1,-s-] their child has [vp4,3-] the best education.
But if you had not quite a lot of money, you shouldn't hope that your child can [vp8,s-] stay in the best one [pr1,s-] It needs money to bribe the board of the kindergarton [fm1,-] so that your child could be received.
It also needs money to pay your child's cost in the kindergarton [fm1,-] which is not cheap at all.
If you had not so much money, you can [vp8,s-] only sent [vp9,2-] your child to a bad, or at least, not so good one.
Then, your child grown [vp5,s-] up, it's time for him to go to university.
Unfortunately, he failured [fm2,-] in the Entering College Exam.
If you had money, you could still help him to receive the college educaion [fm1,-] But if you couldn't support the extra expenditure --- which is really a large sum for a common worker --- your child would have no choice, he could only enter sociaty [fm1,-] to earn his living.
The gap between the rich and the poor is exit [wd3,1-] The rich is more equal [aj3,1-] than the others.
Insofar as I am concerned, I don't think the unequality [fm2,-] will disappear in the near future.
When we look at the whole world, it may not be difficult for us to discover that some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than others as concerning the colors [np5,s-] of them.
But deplorably enough, thousands of years passing away, the deep-rooted racial unjustice [fm1,-] and inequality are still popular.
Still today, people were [vp6,2-] shocked by the nutorious [fm1,-] scandle [fm1,-] of Rodney King's case which happened in Los Angles, the USA, a country that is long viewed as the beacon of freedom and democracy.
Plagues and femine [fm1,-] are wide-spreaded [fm2,-] Every morning they wake up and find that they are living in the great terror of being killed or starved.
Even within the same racial society, we still have many "big" men who are alway [fm1,-] more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
" While [wd5,s-] as far as wealthy [wd2,3-4] social position are involved, this can not be true.
This year, in Indonisia [fm1,-] the names of the ten richest person [np3,3-] in the country have been put in order to show to the public.
More [wd3,s-] I do not deny their ability to become rich.
(t10-7) In his novel "ANIMAL FARM", George Orwell told us that the oppressed animals rose up and overthrown [vp4,s-] the Black Pig, a crude, unjust, violent tyrant.
It was true that the board had been pushed over, but it is also true that the words on it did not rot away with the wooden board, and it is still appliable [fm2,-] today.
"All men are equal" is a long-lasting dream for which so many people, both in [wd4,1-1] west and in [wd4,1-1] east, have fought.
The aged-old [fm2,-] dream has always been in all men's heart and still will be as long as they exist.
It is till true that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Those who own power are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Once they held any leading position, they think themselves superior [aj2,-1] than others, ordering others to do what they like, not considering others' interests.
Furthermore, if ther [fm1,-] are objected [vp1,s-] or protested [vp1,s-] they would, within the region of their power, use all kinds of means to force his will to be obeyed.
Nearly during every term of government, there were some corruption scandles [fm1,-] some of which led to the fall of the government.
If some figures in the government, who of course have [vp6,s-] certain power, were not more equal [aj3,1-] than others, who would have sent money to them and bid [vp1,s-] them for help?
Apart from the persons who have power, the rich are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Nowadays, the world is more and more dominated by money, which means that the more money you have, the more rights you have and the more equal [aj3,1-] you are.
Therefore, it is obvious that they are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
In some strange conditions, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others merely because of their colour of skin, even though they are neither rich nor having any power.
(t10-8) "Every [wd3,-3] people are equal, but some people are more equal.
The United States, the most advanced country in the world, also the so-called "most democratic place" At the beginning of its history, the founders had written clearly about the human rights: "Every [wd3,-3] people are born equal.
But on the other hand, we have to admit that even here some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Furthermore, even if you want to vote, the value of your property must reach [wd4,-2] certain standard.
Once they're elected as the congressman [np3,4-] they can enjoy a lot of privileges immediately, such as having free dinners, free transportation, free accomondations [fm1,-] etc.
In our country we can also meet a lot of such kind [np6,4-] of "more equal [aj3,1-] " people.
Most of them hold high position [np6,2-1] in the government or state-owned companies.
They take full use of their power to seek extra profits, like taking bribes, finding good jobs for their relatives, spending [vp2,-6] country's [np6,s-] money on travelling, eating, going abroad, etc.
All these exert very bad influence among the public [pp1,2-] From [wd4,1-2] above examples, we can clearly see that at every corner of our world the "more equal [aj3,1-] " people all exist.
First, I think, the central government should pay [vp2,-3] more attention on this matter and get those more equal [aj3,1-] ones out of the leadership.
Thirdly, everyone should make good examples [np3,4-1] themselves.
First of all, the unequality [fm2,-] derives from an imbalance in [wd4,1-3] distribution of wealth.
In this world, there are both people as rich as billionairs [fm1,-] and people as poor as church mice.
As for democracy, we can take the judicial system as an example to see how unequality [fm2,-] goes on in this aspect.
Then, an expensive but eloquent and competent attorney may help him to reduce [vp1,-5] the sentence several years shorter or even prove him innocent, though he does commit something guilty.
But people under their control always like to regard [vp1,-6] them as more superior [aj3,1-] [aj2,-] than them and try every means to please them, expecting they can get favour [cc3,1-] from them one day.
In term of this division of labour of [wd4,1-1] society, people are not equal either.
Next reflection of unequality [fm2,-] lies between different races, racial discrimination is mostly existing in white people dominating countries with a multi-race background.
In these countries, though the human rights of its [pr3,4-] citizens of colour has been improved a lot through the ages, there is still a long way to go.
Two years ago, a negro [fm3,-] was beaten to death by the policemen in Los Angeles.
This violation had [vp6,d] aroused indignation and outcry of the public.
To put the foresaid three [wd1,4-1] aspects to a nutshell, though all the governments in the world alledge [fm1,-] their countries to a free, equal and franternal [fm1,-] one, many unequal phenomena cannot be totally got rid of after all.
Though the slogan of "all men are equal" is prevailing for many year [np3,1-] there are still some people who are "more equal [aj3,1-] than the others", even if it is all too bad for us to admit it.
(t10-10) People in each country of the world have struggle [vp9,1-] for freedom and equality for hundreds of years, and it is now nearly the end of the 20 century.
Are all men are [wd6,s-] equal today?
" Actually, these words illustrated the human right situation in the Sovil [fm1,-] Union of the day, and also that of the world.
Fifty years have passed now, and the world have [vp3,2-] changed a lot.
Are these word [np3,1-] still be [wd5,s-] true?
Still in every country, no matter socialism or capitalism, there are some people more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
There are many causes for this phenomenent [fm2,-] Here I would like to mention three, which are common and tipical [fm1,-] The first reason leads [vp4,s-] to the unequalness [fm1,-] is the unequal distribution of poverty [wd3,s-] The current distribution system is enlarging the gap between the rich and the poor.
Although according to the law, the rich and the poor are all civilian [np3,s-] of a country, and have the same rights and [wd4,s-] legally equal.
The richer a person is, the more equal [aj3,1-] he will be.
This conclusion can be proved by a simply [wd2,1-1] example.
A man is accused for [wd3,4-] shoplifting, if he is rich, he can engage the best lawyer or bribe the judge, and he may be free after paying some fine.
But for a poor [wd4,2-1] who committed [vp6,s-] the same crime, he has no money to engage a lawyer or bribe the judge, so he has to be in prison for several years.
The second reason is that in [wd5,s-] nowadays there are two different stratum [np3,2-] in the society.
The more power one has, the more equal [aj3,1-] he will be.
A president of a company can give a good position to the son of a government official who is in charge of tax exchanging for lower taxes than other company [np6,s-] And a mayor can promise to a judge that he would help him become the chief if he gives his nephew who committed a crime a lenient punishment.
The last reason is the difference between different country [np6,1-] different culture [np6,1-] and different races.
Some races, which is [vp3,3-] less developed or had been [vp6,s-] in lower position in history, is [vp3,s-] now being discriminated and unequally treated.
To sum up, people are becoming more equal [aj3,1-] today, but we still have a long way to go.
Various of [wd5,1-1] reasons have made us unable to achieved [vp4,1-] the target our forerunners had struggled for for ages today.
So long as these problems such as the unequal distribution of poverty [wd3,s-] or the commodity of power [wd7,3-] between official [np6,1-] or the racial discrimination exist, the world will never be equal, and the saying "All men are equal, but some are more equal than other" will always be true.
(t10-11) Have you ever seen the film "Animal Farm" adapted by Georgy [fm1,-] Orwell?
In this film, there is a famous saying which was [vp6,s-] stuck out by the black pig when he finally seized [vp6,s-] power.
That is, "All men are equal, but some one [fm2,1-] are [vp3,2-] more equal than others!
First, on a world-wide scale, some countries are indeed more equal [aj3,1-] than others!
America, who [pr5,1-] boasts its indispensable role as a "world police", is at all times interferring [fm2,-] with others' internal affairs.
Putting sanctions against those who refuse to obey his orders, or lifting embargos [fm2,-] on [wd3,2-] the countries finally giving up their positions, Uncle Sam is watching impatiently for his chance to put this world under control.
The United Nations, which is a comprehensive body formed with members of most nations in the world and supposed to deal with the international affairs just [wd2,5-] and fairly, is finally turned [vp7,s-] out to be a "magic word" played by the superpowers on a wide political stage.
On the other hand, the third world, now struggling its way for a better life, is not only dragged by the backward economy and low-leveled education, but also bearing an overwhelming pressure created by some so-called international "peace-keeping troups [fm1,-] ".
In this case, it's hard for the people of these countries to keep territorial integrity and maintain political independence, let along [vp2,s-] human rights and social democracy!
They are simply the dreams far beyond average person's reach and only appear on the screen when the arragant [fm1,-] westerners use them as weapons to attack their opponents.
Second, on a nation-wide scale, it's been a common knowledge [np5,2-] for people to hear the talks of power-abusing, duty-corrupting or bribery-accepting by some high-level officials up to the nameless self-employed laborers [wd7,s-] Most of these people either occupy an important position in the government organization, or enjoy some reputation in the literary and art circles, or simply have a fairly large fortune in the bank.
It's them who make up a "noble class" in contemporary China, and now are regarded as [wd4,s-] superior to those ordinary citizens in terms of ease and comfort.
However, despite their poor income and low social status, we must admit, they are the backbone of our nation and should be paid [vp1,-s-] more respect as well as rewardings [fm2,-] for their life-long devotions [np5,2-3] to this society!
Now, with the famous words "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" echoing back in mind it could be figured out that this not only [ad1,s-] reflects the past, but also the present, and I hope, it won't fulfill a same future!
(t10-12) Thousands of years had past [wd3,4-] till some brave and opimistic [fm1,-] British men announced publicly that "All men a [fm1,-] created equal" in 1689.
We have got great progress, as we all know, that [wd5,s-] we almost demolished kings or queens and it is written down in most nations' constitutions that all men are equal.
It is true that all men are equal now but it is more true [aj3,1-] that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
In this equal world, lots of people are still concerned on [aj2,3-] the colors [np5,s-] of them [pr1,s-] and racial discrimination still exist [vp3,3-] It is quite obviously [wd2,3-2] if you put your view on South Affrica [fm1,-] where black [np6,s-] still can not enjoy the same rights as white [np6,s-] Even in the United States, the freest and equalest [aj3,-] nation, black [np6,s-] dose [fm1,-] not match [vp2,3-3] to the white totally.
Usually blacks get poorer education and living condition [np6,s-] Their social position are [vp3,3-] lower.
They are still crippled by the chains of discrimination and suffered [vp6,s-] police brutality.
While Martin Luther King died with his great dream thirty years ago in Losangel [fm1,-] a fierce racial conflict broke out for the same reason King worried about.
Apart from the racial unequality [fm1,-] man also face [vp3,2-] the problem of wealth.
This difference is becoming more and more bigger [aj3,1-] So we have five stars hotel as well as the benches in the parks.
A rich [wd4,2-1] can pay a fine in stead [fm2,1-] of go [vp4,] to jail.
A rich [wd4,2-1] can employ the best doctor and a rich [wd4,2-1] can even sometimes destroy a poor [wd4,2-3l] with his money, if he like [vp3,2-] The third thing I want to mention is the equality between men and women.
Nowadays, thanks to the Women Liberation Movement, women get lots of rights from their rivals, but women are in some ways still in a subordinate position like before [pp1,1-] They do the same work as men but be [vp9,s-] paid little.
Wives must take their husbands' names and they usually do most of [wd4,2-1] housework no matter who earned [vp6,s-] bread.
It is common to see husband [np6,-s-] enjoy [vp3,2-] reading [wd4,-2] evening newspaper while his wife is washing dishes.
Furthermore, in lots of places, women [np3,s-] is just a subject of men.
The only duty of her is to satified [fm1,-] her man's sexal [fm1,-] request and product [wd2,-1] children.
In these places people sometimes will kill femal [fm1,-] baby [np6,2-] for their inclinations of boy [np6,1-] It is said that "even a cat can face the king", but I am sure if this cat annoys the king he will easily has [vp9,3-] this cat's head cut down.
In our equal world, there are some people decide to fight with the neighber [fm2,-] country and it is some others who have to pick up guns.
So, accord [vp5,-2] to these, I must say that equality has not down [wd3,-] with all God's children.
We still have a long way to go before we can sing together happily "Equal at last, equal at last, thanks [np2,-2] God almighty [47plncprg] we are equal at last!
" (t10-13) In Geroge [fm1,-] Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
So as a large country in the world, China face [vp3,s-] this question as well.
After a long-termed [fm2,-] hard struggle, Chinese people gained freedom and the equal right, especially in the recent years, with the implementation of the Open Policy and other enlighterned [fm1,-] policies, Chinese economy is raising at a stunning speed, and Chinese people have a stable life.
But we have to admit that the people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others are still existence [wd2,2-] These men can be divided into two kinds.
It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] look down upon the average person [cc1,1-] , and think that they are the men of noble birth; It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] solve some sticky questions easily which common people treat as difficult ones; It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] always are accorded courteous reception wherever they go, and their relatives and friends also benefit from them.
So, it appears that the average people are sweating in packed buses, while they are glacing [fm1,-] over streets through the dark brown window of their luxury cars; the average person [np3,s-] are lining up for tickets while they are dialling [fm1,-] gracefully; the average person [np3,s-] are rushing about simpal [fm1,-] things while they sign their names skilfully on brief informal note [np6,3-] All these privilege [np3,2-] separate them from the mass and make them more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
As they have money, they can buy all kinds of special service and convienence [fm1-] In people's views, these rich men are also more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Today's society is developing speedly [fm2,-] and at the same time, our country is trying it's [wd3,1-1] best to suit this development with perfecting it's [24cyzsbrc] rules and regulations.
So during this period, though the unreasonable phenomenons [fm2,-] like these are still exist [vp9,s-] we believe that they will be eliminated one day, and we look forward to the coming of that day.
If this is true, there should be [wd4,d] slavery, segregation and sexual injustice.
The reality is: some men, most from the dominent [fm1,-] class in the society, regard themselves as more equal [aj3,1-] men, as the privileged class.
Look at the status of American negro [fm3,-] Segregation will always exist as long as the whites still bear the thought in mind that they are the dominent [fm1,-] class, they are more equal [aj3,1-] than the negros [fm2,-] [fm3,-] In such a deteriorating society, you are judged not by the content of your character but simply by the color of your skin.
A negro [fm3,-] does not have the equal rights in politics, economy and culture as a white man has.
A court may sentence a negro [fm3,-] to death for a sin for which a white man will only be sentenced to one or two years' imprisonment.
Racial differences makes [vp3,2-] unequal rights.
Pick up a newspaper [wd4,s-] you will easily find a criminal case of corruption.
They seem to be more equal [aj3,1-] than the ordinary people.
Not until these social moth [np3,2-] have been eliminated will our society has [vp9,s-] a bright future, will our people lead a happy life, enjoying the equal rights the law has promised them.
Take a look at the joint-venture enterprises in Guangdong province [fm3,-] , you will probably be shocked by the unfair treatment of millions of workers who have come to Guangdong to fulfil their dreams of success.
They are just treated as cheap labor [wd3,s-] [wd4,s-] even working machines.
Eighty-one workers, most [wd4,1-] from northern provinces, lost their lives in the great fire which broke out a few days ago.
Because there isn't any fire-fighting equipments [np5,-] in the factory at all.
Because they have [vp6,s-] been locked in the workshop by their boss so [wd5,s-] what they could do was only to wait to die.
When and how will such unequality [fm2,-] in all aspects be completely wiped out?
It is true that all men are getting more and more equal [aj3,1-] with the development of the society and the expansion of democracy in our lives.
But we have to admit that unequality [fm2,-] still exist [vp3,3-] almost everywhere.
(t10-15) In his novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
" These words were the writers [np4,1-1] irony to some of the leaders of the former Soviet Union.
But in today's Russia, the phenomenon of breaking promise [np6,s-] and dictatorship still exists.
He criticized [vp1,-s-] the Communist Party monopolizing the politics.
He said the Communist Party should tolerate different opinions and allow other party [np6,2-1] to take part in the election.
But after he became a President [fm3,1-] he didn't keep his promise.
He behaved in contrast with [pp2,-2] his promise.
According to the President's promise, since Russia was a "democracy", any major problem should be determined by [np6,s-1] people.
In stead [fm2,1-] of holding a poll, the President dissolved the parliament.
All people has [vp3,2-] [vp6,d] converged on him.
He can do whatever he like [vp3,1-] without any opposition.
He is more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The president do [vp3,2-] not have a sense of equality and fairplay [fm1,-] He think [vp3,1-] he is more equal [aj3,1-] than his opponent.
The president don't [vp9,2-] think that he is equal to others.
But some people become millionair [fm1,-] in this slack season, of whom 90% are officials.
They become rich because they have more power; because they are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Therefore I think the phenomenon that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still exists in today's Russia.
Some animals were more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Although, I learnt many things about the old society from my parents Since the policy [wd4,2-2] opening to the outside world was introduced in 1979 and we achieved the comprehensive modernization of agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology.
So I think the idea of unequality [fm2,-] almost disappeared [vp6,s-] The important point is depending on your hard working But in a large factory The problem of [pp1,-s-] some workers are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still remains.
My mother and some women make packing bag [np6,2-1] of goods in one of the workshops in the factory.
The more you wire, the more you got [vp6,s-] paid.
One they call is "soft piece", [wd4,-2] other is "hard piece".
If they get the soft piece, it's more easy [aj3,1-] and quick [aj3,4-] for them to wire bag [np6,2-] In order to make more money, some women flatter the supervisor of the workshop.
My mother disgusts [cc3,-2] this practice, so her pay is lower than others and she felt [vp6,s-] unhappy with her work.
When I know that I also felt [vp6,s-] very angry.
I suggest my mother [vp4,3-] report this bad phenomenon to the factory director, and get [vp4,s-] rid of this bad practice [wd7,s-] I have dream [np6,1-1] now.
Only because of [wd4,1-2] different colours of their skin from the white, colour citizens have to take harder work and get lower pay.
Their children can not receive education as high as they want, not because they are not clever enough, but because they have no [wd3,-2] enough money.
And the black, the poorest people in Brazil, who account for 10% of the population, only possess no more than 1% of [wd4,-2] total wealth.
Only if colour people are set free, equality will have truely [fm2,-] come.
Since the Women's Liberation of the 1960s, women's status and conditions has [vp3,4-] attracted increasing attention.
Apart from the two forms mentioned, inquality [fm1,-] in this society has many other various forms.
Obviously there is still a long way to go, but I believe with everyone's efforts, this dream will come true someday, and by that time all men will be truely [fm1,-] equal.
" It is true that the law of America has recognized that all citizens of America are equal and they all have the same rights, despite of different beliefs, religions, races, educations [np5,-] ...
Politically, it is clearly stated in [wd4,1-2] American Law that citizens have this or that kind of right, including the right to run for the presidency.
We all know that none of the last candidates who run for the presidency in America are not millionaire [np3,s-] or billionaire [np3,s-] So the "equal" rights to vote and the "equal" rights to be elected are actually seperated [fm1,-] and the right to be voted is only a "patented article" of the millionaires, or the billionaires.
" Moreover, some white men are more equal [aj3,1-] than some black men.
Though other animals felt angry at the inequality, they dared not speak out, because the pigs raised a lot of fierce dogs to punished [vp5,1-] those who dared to defy their authority.
It's only a tale, but you can find [wd4,1-2] reflection of the huamn [fm1,-] society.
But most of the time we can see some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
It's obvious that those who have got some power can be more equal [aj3,1-] than other common ones.
They would set up rules for others to obey, but they themselves needn't obey it [pr3,s-] thoroughly.
So they become members of the group who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
So the fact that there are always some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still exists today, and will last for a long long time.
In the American Constitution it was declared officially that all men are created eqaul [fm1,-] But in effect, it was not the case.
As a result, unequality [fm2,-] together with other factors begat [fm1,-] the American Civil War.
Negroes are still contempted [wd2,s-] and are not as equal as the whites.
Still remember the accident in which the victim, a black person broke the traffic law, [wd4,s-] took place in Los Angeles two years ago?
More unexpectedly, after the controversial trial, the two white policemen were declared inguilty [fm2,-] Though the case is on trial again under the public pressure and the result is still unknown, we can come to a conclusion from what we have learned so far that in America, the country which calls itself the most equal society in the world, there still exist some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
In America, when you have a desire to run for Senator [wd3,s-] President [wd3,s-] or whatever it is, it is quite impossible for you to get the upper hand over your opponents if you have no strong backup.
At [wd3,-2] such circumstance [np6,2-] you cannot afford the expensive fee of the publicity which will certainly help to make you familiar to the public and as a result will do good to your victory.
Since not all American citizens are billionaires or millionaire [np3,s-] those who are not, I must say most of them are not, will by all means not hold their own with those who are.
In another word, the rich are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
(t10-21) The Declaration of the [wd5,3-1] Independence says: All men are created equal.
Equality, which men have been persued [fm1,-] struggled for and dreamed of for thousands of years, is still our dreams.
Some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than the others among our equally-born creatures.
It is not surprising, [wd4,s-] in China especially in the countryside, men account for most of the people who ask for divorce in the court.
She will be thought to be adultering [fm2,-] or degenerated.
