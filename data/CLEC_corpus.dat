A Healthy Diet
A healthy diet is very important for people.
It contains some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on.
The Chinese diet is considered to be the healthies [fm1,-] in the world.
It contains a lot of fruit and vegetables.
It is rich in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
As a result, a lot of Chinese have healthy white teeth.
So I am very happy to be Chinses [fm1,-] .
People in west eat too much fat and sugar.
They like to eat butter, cream, chocolate, sweet and so on, which contain a lot of sugar.
As a result, they put on weight easily.
Many of them become very fat and some have bad teeth.
The worset [fm1,-] thing is that many westerners die in an early age from the heart illness.
So I thought [vp6,s-] [vp1,2-2] eat more fruit and vegetables, not to ear [wd3,1-2] too much sugar and fat is a real healthy diet.
Healthy Diet
What's a healthy diet?
Many people can not answer this question exactly.
But if they want to be healthy, they should have a healthy diet at first.
People should have more cereal and grain, that's very helpful.
According to a file of the American Health Research, cereals contain more vitamins, proteins, fibre & less fat, sugar than any other foods of the world.
They're the basicest [aj3,1-] food in our life.
Next, people should have more green vegetables & fruits [np5] , they're a part of a healthy diet.
People should have fewer [wd3,1-] food which contains a lot of fat, sugar, western diets are always quite unhealthy, we should ear [wd7,1-] less.

What is a healthy diet?
The foods which contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on is a healthy diet [vp3,s-] .
Such as the Chinese diet that is considered to be the healthiest in the world.
It's high in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
As a result, scores of people in China have healthy white teeth.
On the other hand, the westerners eat a lot of fat in the form of crisps, potato chips, butter, cream and chocolate.
Because of this, they die at an early age from heart illnesses.
Besides, many of them have weight problems.
However, a new hamburgar [fm1,-] restaurant in Beijing was quite popular.
A doctor advised people not to have hamburgar [fm1,-] for it's not a good diet.
Neither is the Coca Cola.
So we should think we're lucky to have the healthy Chinese diet.
What is a healthy diet?
The diet [vp3,1-5] between [wd3,1-] Chinese and Western [wd2,1-] are different.
Some people said that the western food is good eatting [fm2,1-] [wd3,1-] .
Yes!
It's good eatting [fm2,1-] [wd3,1-] but it isn't good for your healthy.
Because most of them are [wd5,1-] contain too much flower, fat and sugar.
People need energy everywhere, every time [wd3,1-] .
For example sleeping, walking running and so on.
The energy is measured in calories.
The Chinese diet is considered to be the healthiest in the world.
I think is because of Chinese eat lots of fruit and vegetable.
It is rich in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
The western [wd3,-1] eat too much food with sugar and fat, like the [wd5,1-] hamburger [fm1,-] , fired [fm1,-] chicken, coca cola, chocolate and so on.
The people become fat of this.
Most of the westerner [np3,1-] had [vp6,s-] weight problem and heart illness.
All of these are because of the diet.
If every thing [fm2,1-] you eat just right and do more exercise, you will be healthy.
Winnie.
Everyone wants to have a healthy body.
So, we usually talk about healthy diet.
A healthy diet should have rich fibre and vitamin, some fat, a little salt, low in sugar.
People [vp3,1-1] considers Chinese diet is the healthiest of all.
The things [vp3,1-3] which people needs are all in the Chinese diet.
Some people say that the food in Mcdonald's [fm1,-] restaurant and Pizza Nut is delicious.
Yes, I think so.
But there are too much fat, sugar salt and other things which too many for people in the food .
If you want to have a healthy , you'd better not eat the food which has too much fat, salt and sugar.
You eat too much sugar, your body [wd7,1-2] becomes fat, after that You [fm3,1-] will have heart illness.
Many people died from heart illness.
And you will also have bad teeth.
A Healthy Diet
Food can change into energy for people.
But not all the food are good for people.
The Chinese diet is thought of the healthies [fm1,-] in the world.
It coutain [fm1,-] a lot of fruit and green vegetable.
It's rich in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
So the Chinese have healthy white teeth.
But in the west, people love eat [vp1,1-] hamburgers, potato crisps, potato chips, butter, and chocolate.
These are all the delicious foods.
But if people eat more these [aj1,1-] food, would put on weight very easily .
And the other important thing is the foods can make many westerners die at an early from heart illness .
So people should be [wd5,1-] eat less fat and sugar.
This is a [wd5,1-] good advice.
Eat more fruits [np5] and green vegetables are good for healthy diet .
I think this diet list is good for people: everyday eat two fruits [np5] , eat more vegetables in dinner .
Drink more water.
It's good for skin [wd7,1] .
If you want a healthy body.
You need water and a [wd5,1-] diet of healthy foods.
But you don't worry about it.
because it has Chinese food .
The Chinese food is considered to be the healthist [fm1,-] in the world.
It contains a lot of fruit and green vegetable.
It's high in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
They're all delicious.
Once you start to eat it, you want to eat more of [wd5,1-1] it.
they're all good for your health.
That's also why lots of people in China have healthy white teeth.
But you mustn't eat much western food.
Because it is rich in sugar and fat.
It contains a lot of sugar in form of potato crisps, potato chips, butter, cream and chocolate.
It's [wd5,1-] also contains a lot of fat in the form of cakes, soft drinks, sweets and so on.
it makes you fatter and fatter.
That's very terrible.
As a result of people eat too much, many people die at an early age from heart illness and have bad teeth .
So, if you want to have a healthy body, Please [fm3,1-] don't eat much western food.

Our diet is rich in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
We eat a lot of fruit and green vegetables.
People eat less sugar than many countries in the world .
That's why the Chinese have white, healthy teeth.
In forgin [fm1,-] countries, people don't eat such healthy food.
Potato crisps, potato chips, butter, soft drinks, cakes and so on are the thinks which can make them fat .
They don't take enough exercise, too.

But the fruit and green vegetables are the most important.
Because they can bring people moisture, and moisture is the most important for one's life.

Western diet contains much fat and sugar than Chinese diet.
Westerners take [wd7,1-] this kind of food and don't take enough exercises.
As a result, people have much fat and sugar.
They have a [np7,1-] unhealthy body.
There're also many health problems cost by the western diet.

They're bad for people's health.
The westerners always eat the high [wd7,1-] fat and [wd7,1-] high sugar food.
Such as hamburger, coca cola, butter, cream.
Because of this, many of them not only had teeth, but also the heart illness.
In some parts of Britain, one preson [fm1,-] in ten, by the age of thirty, has no teeth left!
A healthy diet
Every person needs water and a healthy diet.
But what is a healthy diet.

I advise you to choose Chinese diet!
A Healthy Diet
Every person needs water and a diet of healthy foods.
What's a healthy diet?
I think fruit and vegetable are very important.
If you are fat, you can eat rich in fibre and low in sugar.
You can do more exercise, don't eat much more chocolate, sugar and icecream.
If you are thin, you can eat hamburgar [fm1,-] , chocolater [fm1,-] , sugar and so on.
But don't eat much more, because it is bad for your teeth.
Both fat person [np6,2-] and thin person [np6,2-] are [wd5,1-1] need energy to live.
They eat different kinds of food which change into energy.
The Chinese diet is considered to be the healthiest in the world.
It doesn't [wd4,s] much sugar.
The western world [wd3,1-] , don't eat too much fat and sugar and don't take enough exercise .
Now if you walk in the street, you can see all kinds of food shop, like coffee shop, McDonald's, Timy's [fm1,-] and so on.
Many children very like McDonald's hamberger [fm1,-] , fired chicken and icecream.
Many young ladies or boys [vp3,1-1] likes [vp1,2-4] stay in the western coffee shop.
In fact, the cream, hamberger [fm1,-] milk tea, the big piece [wd3,1-] beer [vp3,1-1] has many [np8,-1] sugar and fat.
It's very unhealthy for the person's body [wd3,1-] and teeth.
" Chinese put the eat [wd3,1-] in the first" it means Chinese foods are very dilious [fm1,-] .
I think the Spanish food, the French food, the Japan [wd3,1-] food, the England food are better but the chinese [fm3,1-] food is the best.
and the most important thing is chinese [fm3,1-] food [vp3,1-1] are more healthy than [wd4,s] another countries.
So, I advise the boys and girls, the mothers and the fathers and the little lovely childrens [fm2,1-] .
Eat Chinese food.
HEALTHY DIET
Healthy Diet should contain some fat, some fibre, a little salt and so on.
People need energy to live.
They eat different of [wd5,1-] food which change [vp7,1-] into energy.
Even when you are asleep, you are sing [wd7,2-2] energy- about 65 calories an hour.
While you are at school or walking home.
Your body is burning up 100 calories an hour.
When playing football or basketball.
You [fm3,1-] might be using 400calories an hour.
On sports day, [wd4,s] may be using 650 calories an hour.
The Chinese food is considered to be the healthiest in the world.
It contain [vp3,1-] fruit and green food.
This food just [vp3,2-1] contain a little fat, sugar, is better than western food .
It [vp3,1-1] contain so much fat, sugar, some people didn't take enough exercise.
Healthy Diet [fm3,1-] is main some fat, some fibre, many fruit, many vegetables and enough exercise .
I advise people to have a lot of fruit and green vegetables.
It is rich in fibre and low in sugar and fat.
You will have healthy white teeth.
Please don't eat too much fat and sugar foods .
Because of this, you will put very easily .
And [wd4,s] will have bad teeth.
For example, in some parts of Britain, one person in ten, by the age of thirty, has no teeth left!
Now, many hamburger restaurant open on many [wd6] places.
I advise people not to have hamburger.
The foods that you buy in hamburger restaurants are high in fat, sugar and salt.
They are not a healthy diet.
Look at this cup of coca cola.
There is as much sugar in it as eight pieces of sugar.
Sugar is not a necessary part of a healthy diet.
YANG RONG A HEALTHY DIET
People get energy from food.
What kind of diet should we need?
In our text book, the author thinks a healthy diet must be rich in vegetable, fiber low in fat and sugar.
This is a popular point of view in most of people .
But I don't agree with them.
Sugar and fat are the most important energy.
If you take a little you will find there is not enough power in your body.
This will hurt yourself [pr1,3-] .
Old men, adults, teenagers, children and babies need different amount of energy.
Teenagers and adults need the most of all.
Children need more than old men and babies .
Because of this, old men and babies should have a diet as our text says.
They don't put on weight.
As they do more exercises and often think deeply.
If they take less fat and sugar, they would have less power.
And it will affect their future.
I advise people [wd4,s] eat enough fat and sugar.
Don't worry about put on weight or bad teeth.
Bad teeth are not by the food .
Now you must know hamburger is not so bad.
It's rich in fat and sugar.
It has less vegetable and fiber than normal meal.
But it's fast food.
Most of people need fast food who are busy in their works.
So do not believe doctor's words at all.
You must choose the right kind of a healthy diet .
And remember do more exercises and wash your teeth every [wd3,1-1] day.
YANG RONG.

In order that, Dad bought me a bike.
From then on, I began to learn cycling.
But, I often hurt myself when I was learning it.
Three days later, I gave it up.
But when I saw my friend play happily with the bike, I felt uncomfortable in my heart.
So I began to learn it again.
At last, I gave it up again two days later.
Dad knew that thing and he felt very angry.
He told me: " You should not give up anything when you're still trying to do them.
Or you can finish nothing for ever!

Thought here were still a lot [aj2,1-] hurt [wd7,1-] on my body, I felt very pleased.

The air conditioner was working, it made so much noise.
Suddenly we heard a big noise that the dog was knocking at the door.
So we went out and saw some fire was burning, it was so strong and near the gas bottle.

The sun was shining hard [ad2,1-] .
Our school were to Qing Yuan by bus .
At first, we [wd4,s] all very happy.
Then we reached [wd4,s] .
We saw many things there.
Many poor children, they hadn't got enough money to go to school.
And their lives was very easy [wd7,1-] .
The thing they ate every day was porrdge [fm1,-] and some things which were bad to eat .
After a meal, we went to the children's framily [fm1,-] .They were really poor.
We found no dest [fm1,-] in their house.
They only have some boxes, broken chairs and some dirty and old clothes.
I couldn't stop myself crying.
What life they were having?

I though [wd3,1-] "They were poor, but they were all hardworking.
?ut I, I [wd4,1-] richer than them, my study were very bad .
My face turned red.
And I decided to study hard from then on.
After an hour, we left Qiong Yuan, on the bus, we were sad, because of what we saw.
From that journey, I knew a truth: If you want to study well, you have to give [wd4,s] .
That journey in Qing Yuan is the most impressive thing in my life.
The most impressive thing in my life North Korea is a socialism [wd3,1-] country near China, I couldn't remember when I had been on this land, but its wonderful enviorment [fm1,-] & korean's [fm3,1-] passions was still in my heart.
I miss the Chinese brave warrior who had bled here [wd3,1-] , had fought for the freedom, had fought for the liberation!
They regarded North Korea as their country, died for them.
There are plenty of Monuments for commemorating the friendship of [wd3,1-] China & Korea.
To impress me most is a monument on a mauntain [fm1,-] , Chinese national flag & korean [fm3,1-] national flag were put together, it meant that our friendship would never change, and a coffin was put in a tempel [fm1,-] near the monument, though I didn't [wd4,1-] who was lying in it, one thing was certain [wd3,1-] , he was a hero.
Ping yong [fm3,1-] was a crowded city with clean air and good weather.
The grandest building in it is the grave of President Jin, the month which I got there was his commemoration day.
sadness was arounding [wd3,1-] over the city, it remained me the sucessgful [fm1,-] thing he had done, he gave precious peaces [np5,1-] to North Korea, he will always stay in Koreans' hearts.
What I have said was all the impressions, they'll be the most impressive thing in my life.

The most impressive thing in my life
There is a river in frunt [fm1,-] of my house.
When I was [wd4,s] child I often swam their [wd3,1-] in summer.
Today, when I see this river.
One [fm3,1-] thing is coming into my mind.
When I was eight [wd4,s] old, that year's summer was very hot, one day, some children and I went to this river to swim.
I couldn't swim very well.
So I stood at the side of the river.
But the other children all swam in the middle of the river.
The middle of the river was very deeply [wd2,1-] and I could not come there.
After a short [wd4,s] ,they saw me standing at the side of the river then [wd4,s] called me swam [vp1,1-] to the middle [wd4,s] .
But I was feeling afraid.
I couldn't.
but one of them said: " It doesn't metter [fm1,-] , have a try.
" And they all said: " yes, have a try, have a try.
" Them I said to myself: "Have a try".
So I swam to stand up, but my feet couldn't reach the land in the river.
Then I fell down into the river.
And I drank lot of water and I couldn't swim.
I shout [vp6,s-] " help [fm3,1-] ".
Then all the children swam to me and pulled me into [wd3,1-] the river, took me to the side of the river and said: " Are you ok?
What's wrong with you?
" I said: " it doesn't metter [fm1,-] , I will be ok soon.
" From then on, I often afraid swim to the middle of the river.
And I grow older and older.
Now I even swim in that river.
I always remember this thing.
It's the most impressive thing in my life.
The most impressive thing in my life
I think the most impressive thing in my life is the first time I talked with foreigner.
I remembered that thing very clearly.
That day way my first day to come to the English School.
Because I was a newcomer, when I came to the school the [wd3,1-] classmates were having class.
Fortunately the students were having foreign teacher's class.
When I reached the class, Istanded [fm1,-] in front of the classroom's door.
The foreigner teacher [wd4,s] me.
She said: " oh, you are late.
" " Oh, my God, what should I do?
" because my English was poor when I was Grade one.
My face was getting red at that time.
Every body [wd3,1-] in the class looked at me.
I was so frightened.
I standed [fm2,-] for a moment and answer the foreigner teacher.
" Yes.
" I answered and then she asked me another question: " I have never seen you before.
Are you the new student.
" " oh, the second difficult question is waiting for me to answer.
" I still answered the question with one word: "Yes".
The classmate looked at me strangely, and then they laughed, I didn't know why they laugh [vp6,s-] at that time.
But now I know.
Because I just can answer the question with [wd4,s] word, "Yes, Yes is my answer.
But the foreign teacher told the students not to laugh at me, and told me not to worry about it, and then call [vp6,s-] me to go to the seat.
I can't forget that thing.
Because my English was poor at that time.
If the teacher want me to answer the same question, I think I will give her the best answer.
But I think losing face is good for us.
The most impressive thing in my life

It was difficult to get on with each other.
But Miss Wang taught us a lot.
She told us that we were at the same ages, very young and very lively.

But there is the most impressive thing to write.
That happened long before when I was nine, I heard from anonymous.

It told me to find the treasure.
At that time, I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry .
I told to my parents and my good friends.
My good friends said: " That's good.
I love adventure.
We can try to do it.
" But my parents didn't agree with my friend.
They thought that was dangerous and absurd " It was absurd of you to suggest such a thing" Many head [np3,1-] of a family said.
We were contradictory.
We wanted to adventure.
But we didn't want to disobey our parents.
At last, we cancelled our plan.
Though that was an opportunity, it passed.
In a word, that thing impressive thing in my life .
Because it was very interesting and regret.
The most impression [wd3,1-] thing in my life
Hong Kong is a good place for travelling, and it impressed me a lot.
When I arrived there, I had the subway for the second time.
The first time was in Beijing, but the most different think is: The subway in Hong Kong is crowded and the people there walk as quickly as they can.
Especially in the morning and the afternoon when the people have to go for work or come back from work, althought [fm1,-] you stand near the subway station, a lot of people walk quickly towards you and leave you in no time, you just have no place to stay for a minute, maybe time for them is the most important, I could really understand "Time is money" The third day when I got here [wd7,1-] , my elder cousin showed me around his university: The Hong Kong Science University and we had a good time there.
The university is built at the hillside that beside the sea.
Of course the environment here [wd7,1-] is wonderful.
When you are at the top of the building, look around the hills and sea, and the wind from the sea blow towards your face.
It's the most comfortable thing.
The lives here [wd7,1-] are interesting.
The environment here [wd7,1-] is wonderful.
I love my country.
The most impressive thing in my life
here [fm3,1-] are many things impress me a lot.
But there's one thing I feel so deep, and I'm sure that it makes me wanna [fm1,-] be a nice people .
That was a saturday [fm3,1-] afternoon, I was sitting on the floor and drinking a bottle of juice.
My father sitting beside me, he [wd6, 4-] was looking a newspaper.
After I had drunk it, I threw the can out of the window.
Suddenly, I heard a loud noice [fm1,-] : " son!
Get down and move it all around, then look below from the window.
" "What else?
Nothing, just some leaves and some cans.
" "Nothing?
If veryone [fm1,-] throw [vp3,1-] some can below, what'll be.
There will be a large dirty place, no one and bear that, so, you must pick the can up and put it into "?"???
" [wd4,s] .
A nice clean, tidy place everyone would like it.
"sorry [fm3,s] , Dad" then I picked up the can and throw into the right place.
This thing tells me to care about the future and surrounding, it is a way to be wonderful.
The most impressive thing in my life
The most impressive thing in my life, I think is the basketball game in this afternoon.
Both girls and boys in our class non the preliminary contest, so the two match holded [vp4,-] in the same time .
But the students sometimes looked at the boys and sometimes looked at the girls.
At first, the girls in our class was lead two points, but not long after, the class two [np1,2-] cought [fm1,-] up with our class, and then the class 2 [np1,2-] surpass [vp3,3-1] us, though [cj1,1-8] our class spare no efforts to play, but at last our class lose the match, but we still got the second place.
This match [wd4,s] impressing me very much.
The most impressive thing in my life
Febray [fm1,-] the 19th [wd4,s] our Great Chairman Deng Xiao Pins [wd7,1-] died and all the people of China were sad.
He rescue China whe [fm1,-] she is very backward country he save China anew life .
He make [vp6,s-] the Hong Kong come back.
He let China unify so quickly, we all can't forset [fm1,-] him.
He and Lu Bo Chen [wd3,1-] lead the army to hit the enemy, and liberate all the China with all the comard [fm1,-] -in-arms, He is one of China's founding fathers.
He gave China's [wd3,1-] people rich life but he is die .
He is a Great man of the world, so went he was die, UN fall [vp6,s-] half of the UN flag.
A lot of foreign counteries [fm1,-] Chairman give Chinese totelegram [fm1,-] of condolence .
I was a Chinese, I must study hard to Build [fm3] the modern China, and don't lost Great father Deng's hope.
The most impressive thing in my life
The most impressive thing in my life was I the first had one hundreds year .
That was at [wd3,1-] 1989?
: at that the [wd5,1-] New Year, My father gave me one hundreds year for pocket when I took a pieces of one hundreds year, I was very happy.
I used the money to buy I like the toys and snacks.
That hundred [wd4,1-] year I used for three months.
But now hundred [wd4,1-] year can't used for one day something.
I think that thing is the most impressive thing in my life.
The most impressive thing in my life
Although I am just 15 years old, I think, the thing impressed me most is the first time I left home for this school.
On [wd3,1-] Septemper [fm1,-] , 1994, my parents sent me to this school.
Before I came here, I thought that it was very exciting.
But after I had came here for two days, I hated it at once!
Why?
Because I must do everything, from making my bed to washing my clothes.
I felt tired all the time, and I was missing home very much.
After three days, mother came to see me.
I cried at once, then more and more loudly.
I said to my mother: " Mum, I won't want to stay here any more, I want to go home, I miss you and father very much!
" Mother didn't say any words at first, but at last she said: " Don't cry, dear.
Your things must be done by you!
Though you're unhappy now, I'm sure after some days, you will [wd4,s] happy again.
Believe me!
" Then the following weeks, I really felt happy at school, because there were a lot of classmates lived with me and played with me!
All of us no longer felt unhappy or lonely.
This thing impressed me most in my life, I think.
The most impressive thing in my life
My childhood is full of happy [wd2,1-] and bitter [wd2,1-] .
I have my own friends, I'm growing with the protection of my parents.
But sometimes I did sth [fm1,-] wrong and made them worried and sad.
I remembered when I was a school girl, A [fm3,1-] new student came to our class, she is a tall girl.
The headmaster planned her to sit next to me.
And the first day she came here, we had a busy talk, we talked everything, and soon we became good friends.
Gradually, I found that her study was not good, and my other friends said that her deed was not good, but I didn't want to lose this friend, so I didn't take notice of it any more.
Slowly, I changed, I always came home late and did not work hard, my parents and the teacher noticed my [wd2,1-] many times.
But I still didn't listen.
At last, she asked me to go out for glaying [fm1,-] , but I had no much money, because my mother didn't give me any more, and I knew they wouldn't let me go our with her.
So she suggested me to take mother's money away without telling her, and my mother dioovered [fm1,-] my bad deed.
She didn't hit me but cried, and I was frightened because my strong mother never cry before people, I began to realized [vp5,1-] that it was rather serious, so I conceded my mistake, but when my tall friends knew that, she was angry, she said I was foolish and never had a word with me, after that when I told my mother about it, Mum said: " as friend she shouldn't ask you to come home late, ask you to steal, she is not a real friend or a good friend.
Don't be sad.
It isn't worth .
You should think that you are lucky, because you broke away from her at last.
' Then, I made friends with others, and my manners and study returned to normal just like before.
And I realized that I was rather foolish at that time, because I made a person who nearly let me go [wd4,s] the wrong way as my best friend.
This thing affected me deeply.
I'll neven [fm1,-] forget this lesson.
The most impressive thing in my life
If my friend ask me: " Which sport do you like best?
" I'm sure that the answer is : " swimming".
When I was six years old, my parents sent me to the swimming school and learn how to swim you may ask me: " why [fm1,-] ?
" I think that may be [wd7,s] my parents wanted to make my body stronger and stronger than the others of my age.
At first, I enjoyed it.
But later, I found it more diffcult [fm1,-] than I had thought .
So I didn't like swimming and began to take it .when [fm3,-s] the teacher asked me to jump into water and swimming [vp5,7-] a long way, I just told a lie to the teacher, and sit near the water just looking at the other children in the water.
Then, my father was very angry, and shouted at me: " Why you don't jump into water like others?!
If you do that again.
I will hit you!
" I was afraid of my father, so I went on learning swimming.
Today, I like swimming very much, and I swim well.
If my father didn't shout at me when I was young, I will not be like this if I hadn't done so hard .
So, I think that is the most impressive thing in my life.
The most impressive thing in my life
That [wd3,1-] is the most impressive thing in my life?
Maybe the first swimming lesson impressed me most.
When I was a baby, my mother often filled the bathtub with water nd [fm1,-] put me in it when she was going to get ready for the meals.
I like [vp6,s-] playing with water very much.
When I was old enough to go to primary school, my parents sent me to the one near my house.
Summer was coming, the teacher brought us to the swimming pool.
She began to teach us how to swim.
But I wasn't paying attention to what she said.
Because I thought that swimming was very easy.
In fact, I had never tried to swim more than ten metres [fm1,-] .
Then we could get to the water.
Because of my carelessness, I got into the water in the deepest place of the pool.
I couldn't touch the bottom.
I was frightened, I repented that I had not learnt how to swim.
Suddenly someone pulled me out of the water.
That was the swimming teacher.
She said to me, " You can did nothing without putting your heart in, you must be modest.
" I knew I had done a wrong thing.
From then on, I remembered what that teacher had said.
I almost do or learn every thing seriously.

The seasons
Today I will talk about the seasons.
Maybe somebody will say how can [wd1, 1-] I talk that, but let's have a think.
There are four seasons in a year, and the seasons are quite different.
For example in summer the weather is very hot, like Wuhan the temperature is always above thirty- six, even forty in the day- time, so many people in Wuhan don't like to go our [fm1,-] in summer.
But at night the temperature will be cool a [ad1, 1-1] little.
In winter, some of Chinese paces [fm1,-] are very cold, like Harbin the weather is very cold, sometimes it snow [vp3, 1-] very hard, and the temperature is usually below zero all day, but after snow, you look around the snow is beautiful, I like the scene very much.
But if let me choose the seasons, I choose winter, because I was born at that time, it doesn't like summer so hot, and we can play snow.
That is interesting.
It was about five o'clock in the morning.
It was dark outside.
At this time, it looked something fall down, what was this?
Oh, it was the snow.
The snow was very thick and the weather was very cold.
The street was looked like longer than yesterday.
Because [fm3, 1-] there were not many people in it.
This time, you can only see one thing--- snow.
It was falling down.
If you saw one or two people.
They [fm3, 1-] were all going to bought [vp5, 1-] breakfast.
Their eyebrows were all white.
Because the snow was on it.
Their milk [wd7, 1-] was freezing.
There weren't leaves on the tree, only some snow.
For a long time, the sun were [vp3, 1-] going out, but nothing changed, it looked like just now: Very cold!
During the Spring Fistival [fm1,-] .
I had a happy day.
In that day, I was go to pay new year visits with my father.

And then I take many [np8, 1-] lucky money.
After that I go [vp6,s-] to aunt's home.
She take [vp6,s-] me go to have a dinner.
I was very very glad.
Because at night, outside the White Swarm Hotel.
There are a beautiful Show.
Every year, in the [wd5, 1-] Guang Zhoy there had some show.
It's wonderful.
When I had dinner.
I can seeing show.
The brightly [wd2, 1-] in the sky, it like beautiful flowers in the sky.
I have [vp6,s-] a enjoyable day.
A day in the winter holiday [wd4, s] The winter holiday I go [vp6,s-] back town [wd1, 1-] home with my presents.
I had so much lucky money from the relatives.
I'll take the money to the [wd7, -1] back.
One day, mother asked me help her do some house- work.

Then I go [vp6,s-] to clean the floor with the mop.
In a moment the floor turn [vp6,s-] very clean.
And I must go to shopping, mother give [vp6,s-] me a list, oh!
It's many [wd6] things: the fruit, the sweet, the drinks*.
About at five o'clock in the afternoon, I go [vp6,s-] back home.
I feel [vp6,s-] tired very [ad1, 1-] much [wd5, 1-] .
But I very haapy [fm1,-] .
Because I can [vp9, 1-] help my mother of a lot of things.
Mother said: " You're grow to manhood.
"
My Dreams
A dream for a young girl is very wonderful!
Like me, I have many nice dreams.
I want to be a clever lawyer, an outstanding pianist, or do something I like.If I am a lawyer.
I must be talkative.
And I must try my best to help the kind persons.
I like this occupation.
Because I can help the people who is in trouble.
They are very poor, I think.
If they are helped by me, they must be very happy.
It's also a good job.
Or I will be a pianist.
It's such an artistic job!
If I am not famous, it doesn't matter, I don't mind this.
Because I only seek nature and truth.
That's enough.
So the best musical country is liked by me.
It's Austria.
Austria is a very beautiful country is liked by me.

Are they same or defferent [fm1,-] in the meaning and use [wd2, 1-] .Li Hua

I also have been in my class team.
Play football is necessary power and swift.
Roberto Baggio is a great football sperts [fm1, -] plaier [fm1, -] , he is my idow [fm1, -] .Dear Maling, Thank you for your letter.
I'm sorry that you are not happy yet in your school.
It is wrong of the other stundents [fm1,-] to make fun of you, you must make friends with some good students.
They could help you.
You said you didn't know how to lose weight quickly.
I think you should not eat much meat, sweat food, suger [fm1,-] with tea, milk, perridege [fm1,-] .
Because they can make you fat.
And you must have sports.
For [fm3, 1-] example: running, swimming, playing football...... Because [fm3, 1-] sports can make you losting [fm1,-] weight quickly.
I hope to you lost [wd2, 1-] weight as quickly as possible.
With best wishes Doctor.
Four people are planning a bicycle trip from Beijing to London.
The trip is about 20,000 kilometres.
Perhaps it take [vp3, 1-] about more than half a year to complete the trip.
Four people are come from China, Australia, Greece, Britain.
They are trying t [fm1,-] collect money for a wild life project.The necklace Ten years ago, Pierre, Mathilde's husband was working in a government office.
Once they'd been invited to a ball at the palace, so Mathilde borrowed some jewellery [fm1,-] from Jeanne.
After the ball, Mathilde looked down and saw that the necklace was not around her neck any more, they couldn't find it, it was lost.
They had to borrowed [vp5, 1-4] the money and bought the necklace to return Jeanne.
During the next ten years, they both worked day and night to pay back the money they had borrowed.
Mathilde met Jeanne again, she had changed so much older her friend couldn't recognize her.
Her friend told her that necklace wasn't a real diamond necklace.
It was worth five hundred france [fm1,-] but was not thirty six thousand frances [fm1,-] .I think women can get jobs easily today.
They can do all kinds of jobs.
For [fm3, 1-] example, teacher, worker, sporter [fm1,-] , writer, driver, doctor..... .
They do well on some way.
But on some way they don't do better than man.
In the battlefield, the men forever in front of the women.
In the city, the trafic-man [fm1,-] control the traffic, day and night.
Women can't do this job.
In China the women [np3, 1-1] leader are not better than the man.
The women also have merit.
They are very carefully [wd2, 1-] .
They are very kind for children.
Hey [fm1,-] know what the children want.
So, they become a [np3, 2-1] teacher who is very well.
But the man are [vp3, 1-] not carefully [wd2, 1-] .
....
I think the women and men are imporant [fm1,-] for the world.
Decemember [fm1,-] , 30th, Monday.
Ma Ling, I hope you are very well.
I am sorry that you are unhappy by [pp1, 1-] your weight.
It is wrong of the other students to make fun of you and [wd4, s] unfriendly to you.
At first, don't worry about being short and fat.
And don't regard your classmates' unfriendly [wd2, 1-] very seriously.
Then you will be happy.
In my opinion, lose weight quickly are not the most important.
Because your are sixteen years old, now.
It is the most important stage of your grow up.
So you can't moderate [wd7, 1-] in eating and drinking.
I suggest you don't eat sweet food much, but not at all.
And everyday [wd3, 1-] morning, you must have sports.
Like running, riding, jumping and so on.
Then they can restrain your weight become more and more, and lose weight slowly.
If you in the light of my said.
I think you will succeed.

Dear Wang Ning, Thank you for writing to me.
You said you had wanted to know about the differences between American English and British English.
The English language we know today is about six hundred years old.
For half that time, English was just the language of the English living in England.
The modern English language grew by about the year 1400.
Many words were borrowed from French and Germany.
As people from Europe travelled [fm1,-] outside Europe, European languages began to [vp7, -1] used in other parts of the world.
At first, the languages staged the same as those in Europe, but slowly they began to grow apart.
Today, the differences between American English and British English are not very great.
Written English is more or less the same in both Britain and America, though there are some spelling differences.
For example, centre, colour, travelled [fm1,-] and favourite are apelt [fm1,-] center, color, traveled and favorite in American English.
But people from the two countries can understand each other easily.
Though the English passed their language on to North America, these days, the British have borrowed a lot of new words from the Americans, such as teenager, boyfriend, radio, football, fan, right away(at once), way of life, and so on.
There are only a very small number of differences in grammar between American English and British English.
The most important differences are in spoken English.
For example, Americans pronounce tomato as [t?`meit?u] , new as [nu:] , address as [adres] .
You may wonder "which is correct?
" The answer is that it does not matter.
But you should speak either American English or British English.
Do not try to speak both at the same time!
Best wishes!
Yours, Mr Lan

Hai Nan and Guang Dong are separated by the Southern Sea.
Because it is influenced by the summer wild.
Guang Dong's weather is wetter and a little hot in Summer.
Every year, Guang Zhou holds once business [wd3, 1-] in Chinese enter port and export exchange.
So it has a lots of a person of ability and advanced skill.
Because of this case, people is [vp3, 1-] easier find jobs.
But these years, Guand Dong's population getting more [wd3, 1-2] and more.
Dear Lily: I have just received your letter.
I hear you is [wd3, 1-] interested in grawing [fm1,-] some vegetables in the garden.
I am sending you a few pieces of advice about your gardening.
First, you must examine soil and ask your neighbours whose plants grow best.
If the condition of the soil is good and you choose the best plants, you should sow seed [np6, 1-] in the correct time of year and your neighbours about the weather.
Second, you'd better make a plan about don't grow plant in the same place year after year, you must to remove the weeds, that the plants will grow taller.
At last, you should turn the soil over with a fork and sow seeds.
If you do that all.
I think your plants must be well and strong.
Dear Mark: How are you?
Thank you for your last letter.
I was very happy to hear that you are coming here to Guang zhou.
Of course we must meet.
First of all, let me tell you about the place where I live.
I live at 22 Jia yan Road, in Hai zhu District.
My house is next to Jia yan Road, so it is very noisy.
My house isn't far from my Middle School.
It's only a 15 minute bicycle ride from my school.
There are a sitting room, a dining room, two bedrooms, separate kitchen and toilet in my house.
It is convenience [wd2, 1-] to live [vp1, 1-1] my house, because there is a Seven- eleven Supper Market near my house.
In the market there are a lot of fish, vegetables, meat and fruits [np5] .
When you come to Guang zhou, you can live with me in my happy house.
Pleaes [fm1,-] write soon.
I look forward to meeting you.
All the best, Dion
Women's Day There is a women's Day in China.
It is held on Mar 8th every year.
During the women's Day all the women will wear their beautiful clothes and make the face beautiful to take part in the Women's Party [fm3, 1-] .
In the party they will do their best to sing, dnce [fm1,-] or eat.
On that day women will be [vp7, -1] recieved [fm1, -] present by [pp1, 1-] their husband or son.
They do not work, because their husband or son will do all the housework.
I think that would be enjoyable.
On that day you will find all kinds of pretty women over the city.
There is not enough land by the sea.
The population is growing every minute.
Many people can not find work in the capital.
They are moving into the forests until they come to a forest.
Then they burn the forest and plat [fm1,-] crops for their cows.
The farmers don't stay along in the same place.
They move on to a new place every two or three years.
Because the soil is very thin in the forest.
People can only grow crops in the forest for one or two years.
And the soil can easily be destroied [fm1,-] the burning and by the cows.
My Uncle
It was Sunday, I was eager that evening would come quickly, Because [fm3, 1-] my uncle has come back from Shanghai with his wife.

All of us will waite [fm1,-] you by the lakeside.
June 14 Sunday Sunny it [fm3, 1-] was about 30 centigrade in the afternoon.
I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river.
Most of them were good at swimming.
And there was a little girl who was learning swim.
Her mother [vp6, -s] taught her.
I often went swimming in my childhood.
It was ten years ago I spent my holiday in Beijing.
I had my last swimming.
I think that June is the best mouth of a year.

I Like Swimming
I like swimming.
When I was still a child, I was taught swimming by my father, and I could swim over 500 metres by eleven.
Why I love swimming ?
At first, because it is a very good sport.
It is helpful for keeping us healthy.
And the second reason is it can train our determination when we take a long swimming.
At last, swimming is also a good amusement in summer.
Try to enjoy swimming, you'll find it is very interesting.

At half past ten, suddenly two men with the right cards came for the professor's invention.
They talked with the professor [wd4, s] a few minutes and went in a hurry with some papers which was [vp3, 1-] given by the professor.
After some time, Miss Green, the pofessor's [fm1,-] secretary found that the two men were not the right men while two policemen came.
It was strange that the professor didn't worry at the news.
He smiled and explain [vp6,s-] that he had known the men were imposter [np3, 3-] because they were nervours [fm1,-] and were anxious to go, so he gave the wrong papers to them.

Someone said.
How we miss the time of the past!

Steel making
After finishing reading <<How the Steel Smelt?>>I was deeply moved by the Paul's spirit.
I really undertand [fm1,-] why the book has been popular with many peopler [fm1,-] for many years.
Paul is a good example to us.
We should have the strong will at all time, whether at study or at work.
We should not be afraid of difficulty but beat it.
This will lead us to success.

A GREAT SCIENTIST-Li Siguang
Li Siguang was born in the Bei province [fm3,2-] in 1889.
When he was young, he studied hard in his class , then he went to Japan to study.
after [fm3,-s] his return to China .
he taugh [fm1,-] in a collage, and did recerch [fm1,-] work.
For political reasons, he excapted [fm1,-] to Britain.
After liberation, he came back to China to take part in the building of new China.Li Siguang was a foumase [fm1,-] esport [fm1,-] , a great selantish [fm1,-] who set up a new theory in his recerch [fm1,-] when the westem [fm1,-] scientists said that.
"China was poor in oil" .
he [fm3,-] was very angry and said serious [wd2,2-] .
"no [fm3,-s] you are wrong, China is rich in oil.
" As a result.
acording [fm1,-] [pp1,-] his theory, China found many oil field [np3,2-] .
He made great contribution in [wd3,3-2] our country.
THREE ANSWERS
George was a clever newspaper man.
He worked for a good newspaper, and he liked to argne [fm1,-] with people very much.
He argued with anybody and about anything.
Sometimes he talked with cleever people [fm2,-] but very often they were not so clever as he.
he [fm3,-s] did not mind argaing [fm1,-] with foolish people.
He knew he could never make them change their mind, because they could not really understand what he was saying.
He found those foolish people were always sure that they were right and they often said very interesting things.
One day, George talked with a man of course the argdment [fm1,-] came to nothing.
in [fm3,-s] the end the man said," well [fm3,-s] , sir, you should never forget this: there are always three answers to every question: your answer [fm3,-s] my answer, and the correct answer.
" George thought it was interesting, and he never forgot it.
LEARNING A LANGUAGE
in [fm3,-s] schools all over the world boys and girls are learning language [np6,-] .
many [fm3,-s] grown-ups are doing so in their spare time.
Everybody knows [wd4,2-2] own language, but to know another is very useful.
Which is the best may [fm1,-] to learn a language?
We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children.
If we could learn a second language in the sane way, it would not seem so difficult.
Think of what a child does.
It listens to what people say and it tries to limitate [fm1,-] what it heard [vp6,s-] .
When it wants something, it has to ask for it.
it [fm3,-s] is using the language.
It is talking in it and thinking in it all the time.
if [fm3,-s] people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly.
It is important to remember, also, that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it, not by seeing what they write.
We imitate what we hear.
In school, though you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak, it is best to learn all new words through the ear of cause [wd3,s-] , you must learn to read them, spell them, and write them, too.
There is no easy way to success in language learning.
a [fm3,-s] good memory is a great help, but it is not enough only to memerize [fm1,-] rules from a grammar book.
it [fm3,-s] is not such used learning [wd7,s-] by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on.
we [fm3,-s] must learn by using the language.
of [fm3,-s] [wd7,-s] we are satisfied with a few rules we have memorized, we are to [wd5,-s] really learning the language.
" learn [fm3,-s] through practice" is a piece of good advice for those who are learning a new language.
Practice is important we must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can.
we [fm3,-s] learn to swim by getting into the water and swimming.
And we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.
HAPPY NEW YEAR
today [fm3,-s] is New Year's Eve.
a [fm3,-s] year will [wd4,3-2] over once [wd7,s-] , a new year will come.
I received several cards which was [vp3,s-] writen [fm1,-] "happy [fm3,-] new [fm3,-] year [ [fm3,-] .
"How right it is!
in [fm3,-s] the new year, we all live happily.
we [fm3,-s] should forget all the sad things.
if [fm3,-s] today is finished, everything will become better.
There are so many friends hopes me happy.
I must be happy, and I want to make them happy.
This year, though I studied [vp6,-s] in Fu Zhang Middle School, it was [vp6,s] a good thing, but these days, my studies was [vp3,2-] [vp6,s] not very good.
I'll work harder next year, I'll be successful.This year, I had [vp6,s] many friends, they get [wd4,2-3] well with me, I'm very glad.
Next year, I'll get more friends, study well and play well with them.This year, I cried [vp6,s] several times.
But sometimes, I cried because of [wd5,1-4] I'm too happy.
Our football team was the first team in the Grade.
From now on, I can't cry again, as a cards [np3,1-] wrote [vp6,s] "you [fm3,-5] should make a happy girl.
" Except that, I'll become strong.
A new year, a new beginning, we'll work hard for our, we all live happily for me.
SOMETHING ABOUT ME
my [fm3,-s] family name is Zhang and giver [fm1,-] name is Xiao.
I was born in XinXing [fm3,-] of He Nan [fm2,1-] provice [fm1,-] in 1981.
I started school at seven and strdied [fm1,-] in LianYuan [fm3,-] Primary School for three year [np3,2-] .
Then I turn [vp6,d] to a new Primary [fm3,2-2] [wd4,3-2] called YuCai [fm3,-] .I studied [wd4,2-3] Janior [fm3,-2] middle school at twelve in 1994.
In the same town .
in [fm3,-s] the school I studied maths, English and so on then I don't know [vp6,s] why I study and to study, but still like [vp6,s] to do it.
I prefer to study computer [cc3,1-] .
Because it's very interesting and much easy to control it.
in [fm3,-s] the class I could study and play in [wd3,1-4] the same time.
I finished my Juior [fm1,-] middle school study and continue [vp6,s-] [wd4,1-1] study in high middly [fm1,-] school in 1996.Now, I am a middle school student, I found it much different from times ago .

THE ZOO-KEEPERS
my [fm3,-s] friend, Jim, is a zoo-keeper in the National Zoo.
His work is very interesting but it is hard.
Sometimes it is dangerous, too.
Every morning the zoo-keepers have to eat [wd3,-1] up at five to prepare the food for the animals.
Each kind of animals is giver [wd7,-] special food.
the [fm3,-s] lions must be giver [fm1,-] meat, the griaffes [fm1,-] must be given grass and leaves, the parrots must be given fruit and nuts, and so on.
sometimes [fm3,-s] some animals won't let the others eat their food.
If this happens each of them must be separately [wd2,2-] .every [fm3,-s] morning each cage must be washed by the zoo-keepers.
This can be dengerous [fm1,-] , especially with lions and tigers.
To make the work easier, the animals are locked in the sleeping comparment [fm1,-] while the cages are being washed.
It is nit [fm1,-] easy to inject a silk lien [fm2,-] !
RADIO AND TELEVISION
radio [fm3,-s] and television are very useful in the world.
they [fm3,-s] may be seen everywhere.
Thousands and thousands of people watch TV.
Perhaps even more people listen to radio.
television [fm3,-s] of course is more useful than radio.
on [fm3,-s] TV we can see that [wd3,3-4] is happeared [fm1,-] around us.
however [fm3,-s] , radio is not disappeared [vp7,3-] .
It is still with us.
It can be done very small [wd7,s] .
It's easy to take.
You can put one in your pocket and listen to [wd4,s-] in the bus or on your bike.
When you go to work.
and [fm3,-s] radio is much more cheaper [aj3,2-] than television.
TWO MICE
once [fm3,-s] there were two mice.
They were friends.
One mouse lived in the country; the other mouse lived in the city.
after [fm3,-s] many years the country mouse saw the city mouse.
He said," do [fm3,3-s] come and see me at my house in the country.
" so [fm3,-s] the city mouse went.
the [fm3,-s] country mouse took him to his house in a field.
He gave him the nicest food .
the [fm3,-s] city mouse said ,"this [fm3,-s] food is not good , and your house is not good .
why [fm3,-s] do you live in a hole in the field?
You must come and live in the city.
You can live in a mice house [cc1,1-] make [vp4,4-2] of store.
You can have nice food to eat.
You must came [vp9,1-] and see me at my house in the city.
" The country mouse went to the house of the city mouse.
it [fm3,-s] was a very good house.
Nice food was set [wd5,-] ready for them to eat.
but [fm3,-s] just as they began to eat they heard a great noise.
The city mouse cried: run [fm3,1-1] !
Run [fm3,1-1] !
the [fm3,-s] cat is coming!
" they [fm3,-s] ran away quickly and hid.
after [fm3,-s] some time they came out.
when [fm3,-s] they came out the country mouse said: "I don't like living in the city.
I like living in my hole in the field.
For it is nicer to be poor and happy, than to be rich and afraid.
"
TRY TO USE ENGLISH
as [fm3,-s] a senior student, you may have realized the importance of English.
But how can you study English well?I think it necessary that you shoud [fm1,-] try you [pr4,-1] best to use English.
We study English, not study [vp4,s-] about English.
that [fm3,-s] a person knows a set of grammatical rules and a lot of English words does not mean that he has mastered English.
A student's mastery of English .
a [fm3,-s] student's mastery of English is ultimately measured by how well we can use it, not by how much he knows about it.
I be live [fm2,1-] that learning English is just like learning to play the radio.
a [fm3,-s] student of the piano lessons has only one purpose: after practising, he is able to play the piano so you should also here such a purpose: you are able to use English.Using English consists [cc2,2-] of speaking English and writing compositions in English, in order to improve your spoken English.
You'd better take an active part in the teacher's lecturse [fm1,-] answer his questions in English, and try to speak as much as you can aiter [fm1,-] class.
Writing English journals is the best way to improve your writing.
at [fm3,-s] the same time you should listen to and read more English.
OUR FACTORY
I work in a factory which make [vp3,s-] farm machinery.
it [fm3,-s] [wd4,1-2] in Chongping, Sichuom Provinee [fm1,-] .
It is on the bank of the Jialing River.
the [fm3,-s] factory is quite big.
there [fm3,-s] are five workshops.
there [fm3,-s] are over a hundred workers on each shift in every workshop .
and [fm3,-s] there are two big storehouses.
We keep our products there before we ship them away.
Very often we have to put some of the products in the open air, for there isn't enough room in the store houses.
so [fm3,-s] the factory yard is always crowded.
We make all kinds of farm machines -walking tractors, rice-field tractors, water pumps and many others.
We make small farm tools, too.
Such as siddes [fm1,-] , hoes and shovds [fm1,-] .
The factory owns a pier at the river bank.
every [fm3,-s] day ships and boats come with saw [fm1,-] materials for the factory and leave with farm machines for cities, town [np6,1-1] and people's communes along the Chang-Jiang [fm2,-] River and the Jialing River.
Products for other places go by train.
as [fm3,-s] the factory is a new one, must [fm1,-] of the workers are young people.
But there are some old workers, too.
Three of the five workshop heads are old workers, one is [wd4,2-2] young man of twenty-two.
The other is a middle-aged woman.
The old workers give the young ones a lot of help in their work.
The travel Various [wd7,3-3] runs a TV university branch school for young workers and couds [fm1,-] .
they [fm3,-s] learn maths.
chomisty [fm1,-] physics and English, some the only one or two of the four hours [wd7,9-] .
the [fm3,-s] technicians in the Various [wd7,2-1] laboratories help the young worker [np6,-s] in their study during their spare time.There is a dub [wd7,3-3] in every workshop.
During the lunch break people like to go there for a rest, they play cards, listen to the radio or just have a smoke.
Many young workers prefer to play basketball for half an hour before they start work again at 1:30 in the afternoon.
We all work very hard.
WATCHING TV
my [fm3,-s] father bought a black -white TV set then [wd3,s-] I was five [wd4,2-1] old.
Since then, I've make [vp9,1-] friends with it.
when [fm3,-s] I was a primary school pupil, I liked to match [wd7,3-3] the children's programmes.
the [fm3,-s] interesting stories are very delightful.
My classmates and I often talked about the stories after class.
Soon, I became a middle school student, I found that I had lost interest in these children programmes.
Instead , I was interested in the news programmes of CCTV.
though [fm3,-s] [fm1,-] these programmes I knew many important events at home and abroad.
and [fm3,-s] these news broadcasts [np5,2-] became our main topic of talks amony [fm1,-] us.when [fm3,-s] I was 12 [wd4,4-1] old, my father bought a big colour TV set.
the [fm3,-s] colourful and beautiful pictures fascinated me.
how [fm3,-s] glad I was!
I always sat in front of the TV set until all the programmes were over.
My parents began to worry about me and I also felt my eye sight failing I knew I spent too much time in watching TV.
Now, I only watched [vp6,3-] the educational programmes and the news, of course of [wd7,2-6] there is a good film on TV.
I will not miss it.
MY HOMETOWN
I was born in Xin xang [fm2,1-] in Henan province [fm3,1-] .
so [fm3,-s] my hometown is Xinxang.
Xinxiang isn't a great city.
so [fm3,-s] it hasn't many tall buildings .
but [fm3,-s] the things are cheap in here.
How Xinxiang is dire lopping [fm2,3-] quickly and there are some tall buildings had been set up.
some [fm3,-s] streets are built so widely [cc5,2-] , but the cars and buses are dicreasing [fm1,-] .
There are some trees and lights beside every street.
at [fm3,-s] the evening.
the lights beside the streets all turn on.
it's very beautiful.
and [fm3,-s] people left [vp6,s] their home and went to the open air.
In the open air.
some people went [vp6,s] to [wd5,3-3] shopping or eating.
There are many school [np3,1-] in Xinxiang and there're two middle are gook [fm1,-] school [np3,4-] in Henan province [fm3,2-] in [fm3,-s] the north of my hometown, there're many beautiful mountains.
So I must study hard from now on.
because [fm3,-s] we'll build our hometown in future.
A DoG
a [fm3,-s] dog is a kind of animal, you can find it almost everywhere in the world.
It often lives with people at home.
It is one of the pet animals.
most [fm3,-s] of them are liked by people.
Dogs are different in colours.
Some may be black or white, some may be yellow or brown, some are black and white.
Baby dogs are really lovely.
Many people keep a dog for pleasure.
They feed it and build a little house for it, they often play with the dog and teach it how to dance and how to play garmes [fm1,-] .Dogs can help people, because they can watch the door.
In the country, farmers like to keep dogs not only for pleasure, but also for watch [vp4,1-2] the door.
They can heap [wd3,2-4] farmers keep the door, room, gruin [fm1,-] and so on.
In the city, dog [np6,2-s] also help people catch theif [fm1,-] .So dogs are really our friends.
We should take good care of them.
THOUGHTS OF A SPEECH
in [fm3,-s] [wd3,-3] an [np7,-2] Santurday [fm1,-] afternoon, all of the students in Grade one [fm3,-] of senior school had an English party.
There were English songs, plays, speech [np6,2-2] and so on.
These pogrammas [fm1,-] were all very good, but the one programme I was interested in was a speech which [wd5,s-] from Zhao Shanshan.
Her speech wasn't only easy and smooth but also full of her feeling.
Zhan Shanshan was my old classmate.
When I was in junior middle school .
We were in the same class.
we [fm3,-s] were both interested in English.
I could remember, we once had taken part in an English competition.
And I did better than her.
I thought it could tell every body [fm2,1-] that my English was better than her .
So I was very happy.
I had never thought her English would be better, until I had listened [vp1,1-3] her English Speech.
at [fm3,-s] that time, I found she was better.
 [wd4,-s] thought for a long time, I found it wasn't that I want [vp6,s-] enough [cc6,1-1] clever, but I need one thing that she had.
that's [fm3,-s] guts.
In my opinion, in future the society will need the persons who have ability.
if [fm3,-s] a person have [vp3,3-] ability, he wasn't only clever but also have [vp3,s-] guts.
The 2 parts are both important.
Of [wd3,-s] you haven't guts, you will not find chance to get success.
If you aren't cleaver [fm1,-] enough , you can't stand in the society.
So from now on, I'll work hard, at the same time I'll train my guts [cc3,2-] .
I'm [vp6,-s] be a useful person in the future.
FATHER
my [fm3,-s] father is only a common person of China.
he [fm3,-s] doesn't know lots of knowledge and also can't speak deep language [cc4,2-] .
He always works for my family every day.
father [fm3,-s] is very hard.
his [fm3,-s] family was very poor when he was young, so he had to word [fm1,-] early.
After many years, his face became [vp6,s] very black because of the sun's burning, and his two hands are very rough because of many years of hard work.
In the [wd5,1-1] summer, the weather is so hot.
He still doesn't stop his tow [fm1,-] hands.
In the [wd5,1-1] winter.
The mind [wd3,1-1] blows so large and cold , father's hand [np6,1-1] still continue to do something.
when [fm3,-s] I faced my father, I didn't know what I should do.
I only hope me to grow faster.
Then I can let him have a rest.
In an art book, there is a picture called "father ".
I'm sure I didn't describe [wd7,s] my feeling when saw [vp4,s-] the picture.
the [fm3,-s] father who is in the picture, his [pr5,-] thin and black face likes [wd2,s-] my father's very much.
Especially the eyes that is [vp3,s-] full of hope.
He only hope [vp3,2-2] that his children will be useful to the society in the future.
Father's eyes told me that the road of live [wd2,1-] is too long, and also taught me how to walk out my own [wd7,s] the life of road.
A PAIR OF TROUSERS
a [fm3,-s] young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers .
when [fm3,-s] he got home, he went upstairs to his bedroom and put them on.
He found that they were about two inches too long.
He went downstairs, where his mother and his tow [fm1,-] sister [np3m2-1] were washing up the tea thing in the kitchen.
"these [fm3,-s] new trousers are too long," he said, "they [fm3,-s] need shortening by about two inches.
Would one of you mind doing this for me, please ?
" his [fm3,-s] mother and sister were busy and none of them said anything.
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches.
She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.Later in [wd3.1-2] , after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers.
she [fm3,-s] was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly up stairs [fm2,3-1] without saying anything to anyone, and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The young [wd3,d] sister went to the cinema, but when she came in, she too, remembered what her brother had said.
She ran upstairs with her scissors, needle; and thread, and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers.
you [fm3,-s] can imagine the look in the young man's face when he put the trousers on the next morning.
SELLING BOOKS
I'll never forget- the matter [wd3,-] that I sell books.
I remember that day when it is [vp6,s] July 23nd [fm1,-] 1995.
I collected some all [wd5,2-4] kinds of old books, from my friends and parents.
Decided to go to sell books .at [fm3,-s] 2 o'clock p.m.
I took the books with three of my friends to get to [wd4,2-1] book-market.
we [fm3,-s] put a big piece of paper and put these books on the paper.
after [fm3,-s] a short while our old Book Market was full of people.
"Hill, How [fm3,1-s] much is this book-Beautiful Friend ?
" one [fm3,-s] of the girls asked.
"two [fm3,-s] Juan".
I answer [vp6,d] shyly.
"oh [fm3,-s] , it's old.
It's worth one yuan at the most.
" She said.
I didn't know what to say.
after [fm3,-s] all it's my first time to be a seller.
Finally she spend paid [wd5,2-4] only 150 fen for it and went away happily.
Looking at her .
I said to myself, " I must be braver next time.
" just [fm3,-s] there [wd7,-] a boy with glasses came up.
"what [fm3,-s] can I do for you?
" I asked with a smile.
"Ah, I want this cartoon book.
" He said.
I turned it over and said "you [fm3,-s] see the fice [fm1,-] 3 yuan and you may pay only 2.5 yuan for it.
" "well [fm3,-s] can you make it a little cheaper!
" "sorry [fm3,-] .
but [fm3,-s] it's quite a nice book, isn't it?
" at [fm3,-s] last he paud [fm1,-] 2.5 yuan for it.
soon [fm3,-s] 58 books had been sold and I myself sold 21 of them.
how [fm3,-1] wonderful!
I learned a lot from this practice and it can't be learnal [fm1,-] fool [wd5,4-3] from text books.
What an unforget [fm1,-] take experienle [fm1,-] .
I'll tell you a true story.
It happened in my hometown.
my [fm3,-s] hometown is LinZhou [fm3,-] city.
In town many of [wd5,1-1] people are rich, but the village which is my hometown is very poor.
the [fm3,-s] village next to ShanXi [fm3,-] province [fm3,1-] .
there [fm3,-s] are a lot of hills.
on [fm3,-s] the hills, many flowers and plants are grown.
There is a clean river in the village.
it [fm3,-s] is [wd4,-3] very beautiful place.
But people are very poor.
they [fm3,-s] often wear old clothes.
They eat potatoes and drind [fm1,-] porridge.
Children have to do a lot of housework so that their parents can go to fields and grow crops.
Last year, 2 [wd7,2-4] went to my hometown.
I met the [np7,d] family.
The girl asked her mother for money.
At first, I thought she wasn't a good girl.
but [fm3,-s] later.
I heard "Mother, I want to go to school.
I'm fond of studying.
I like teacher and my [wd1,4-1] classmates.
I really want to go to school.
I prefer not to eat lunch in order to go to school.
" the [fm3,-2] girl cried.
"LiLi, you are [wd4,-2] good girl.
I know that you learned very well.
But our family was [vp6,d] so poor.
I can't give little money to you to go to school.
" The mother said and cried.
That [wd3,-2] a pity!
I couldn't help crying and I give [vp6,s] them 50 yuan.
I knew [vp6,s] this is very little.
So I tell the story to you.
I hope all of [wd5,1-1] people help to [wd5,1-2] the girl.
please [fm3,-s] help that pity girl [cc1,1-] !
FISHING
one [fm3,-s] day, my brother and I decided to go fishing.
Some years ago we often went fishing by a small river ten kilometers away from my hometown.
The river wasn't wide, but the nater [fm1,-] was very clear and the river was rich in fishes.
Many fishing fans used to go there for a good catch.
We set off very early that morning.
At about seven o'clock we got to the river.
but [fm3,-s] what we saw there surprised us very much.
We couldn't find any people there.
instead [fm3,-s] we saw rubbish every where [fm2,1-] on the surface of the river floated something dirty and dead fish.What's more, there was a foul smell.
We wondered how fish could lice [wd7,4-3] in such water.
After we got our fishing-tackle .
We began to fish.
we [fm3,-s] waited and waited.
More than two hours passed but still no fish was caught.
how [fm3,-s] disappointed we were!
At last we couldn't stand the temible [fm1,-] smell any longer and had to go home.
I [wd3,-3] was awful that with the development of our industry move [wd5,s-] and [wd5,s] more rivers were being polluted.
we [fm3,-s] must do some thing [fm2,1-] to prevent out rivers from being pollnted [fm1,-] .
MY YOUNG FRIEND
two [fm3,-s] years ago, I met a boy about seven years old.
he [fm3,-s] was always quiet.
at [fm3,-s] first I thought perhaps he was a quiet boy.
Later I got to know from my father that he was dumb.
Though he couldn't talk to me, we got on well with each other.
I thought he must be unhappy to live in a world without any sound.
But soon I found he was as clever and aetive [fm1,-] as the other children.when [fm3,-s] the summer holidays were over, I had to go back to my school and he was sent to a school for the handieapped [fm1,-] children.
since [fm3,-s] then I had never seen [vp6,d] him again.
last [fm3,-s] winter I happened to meet him again in the street.
how [fm3,-s] glad we were!
He had grown much taller.
He invited me to his home.
He "told" me with sign language that he loved his school very much.
The teacher treated them as their own children.
With their help , he could write and read now.
then [fm3,-s] he "told" me that he was interested in drawing.
He showed me a green box.
It was the prize he got in a drawing competition.
At last he "told" me a secret [fm3,-s] .
he [fm3,-s] wanted to go to college when he finished middle school!
SELLING BOOKS
I'll never forget the day-May 23nd [fm1,-] , when I sold 21 books.
it's [fm3,-s] really an unforgettable experience to me.
Pan Hao, chairman of the students' Urion [fm1,-] , called for us to orgainze [fm1,-] an old Book Market [fm3,s-] , I was the monitor of our class then.
I got 63 books from my classmates to the open air behind our new teaching- building.
the [fm3,-s] bell rang and school was over.
after [fm3,-s] a short while, our old book market was full of students.
"Hi How much is this book -Beautiful friend?
one [fm3,-s] of the girls asked .
"one [fm3,-1] yuan.
" I answered shyly.
"oh [fm3,-s] , it's old.
It's worth 50 for [wd7,3-3] at the most.
" She said.
I didn't know what to say.
After all it's my first time to be a seller!
finally [fm3,-s] she said [wd3,1-s] only 60 fen for it and went away happily.
looking [fm3,-s] at her, I said to myself, "I must be braver nest time.
" Just then a boy with glasses came up.
"what [fm3,-s] can I do for you?
" I asked with a smile.
"ah [fm3,-s] , I want this cartoon book," he said.
I turned it over and said, "you [fm3,-s] see, the price is $2.50 for it [wd5,s-] .
""well [fm3,-s] , can you make it a little cheaper?
" "sorry [fm3,-s] , but it's quite a nice book, isn't it?
" at [fm3,-s] last he paid $2.50 for it.
soon [fm3,-s] after [wd3,-] 58 books had been sold and I myself sold 21 of them.
How wonderful!
I learned a lot from this practice and it can't be learned from teat [fm1,-] books.
What an forgetable [fm1,-] experience!
HONG KONG
dear [fm3,-s] friend, did you gone [vp9,2-3] to Hong Kong?
if [fm3,-s] you go to Hong Kong by air .
you [fm3,-s] will arrive at Kat Tak Airport.
Because there was no [cc6,-2] enough land, this was built out in to [fm2,s-] the sea.
It is in the past of Hong Kong.
called Kowloon.
Kowloon is one of the two big cities in Hong Kong.
It is on the land.
only [fm3,-s] a few kilometres from the people's Republic of China.
The other city is Hong Kong itself.
It is on an island.
you [fm3,-s] can get there by ship or through a Tunnel [fm3,2-] under the sea.
much [fm3,-s] of Hong Kong is farm land and mountains.
the [fm3,-s] population of Hong Kong is over 4 million.
Most of them are Chinese.
Chinese and English are spoken by many people there, clothes, computers, radios and TCS are made on [wd3,2-1] Hong Kong.
you [fm3,-s] can but [fm1,-] all kinds of things.
such as weathers computers [cc1,1-] are very cheap.
Hong Kong will be returned to china [fm3,s-] , welcome to Hong Kong!
LEARNING A LINGUAGE [fm1,-] 
in [fm3,-s] school all over the world boys and girls are learning foreign languages.
Many grown-ups are doing so in their spare time.
Everybody knows his own language, but to know another is very useful.
Which is the best way to learn a language?
We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children.
If we could learn a second language in the same way, it would not seem so difficult.
Think of what a child does.
It listens to what people say and it tries to imitate what it heard [vp6,s] .
When it wants something, it has to ask for it.
it [fm3,-s] is using the language.
It is talking in it and thinking in it all the time.
if [fm3,-s] people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly.
It is important to remember, also, that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it , not by seeing what they write.
We imitate what we hear.
In school , though you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak , it is best to learn all new words through the ear.
Of course, you must learn to read them, spell them , and write them, too.
There is no easy way to success in language learning.
A good memory is a great help.
But it is not enough only to memerize [fm1,-] rules from a grammar book.
It is not such used learning by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on.
We must learn by using the language.
If we are satisfied with a few rules we have memorized, we are not really learning the language.
" Learn through practice" is a piece of good advice for those who are learning a new language.
practice [fm3,-s] is important.
we [fm3,-s] must practice speaking and writing the language as much as we can.
We learn to swim by getting into the water and swimming.
and [fm3,-s] we learn to speak English by speaking it and not by being told about it.
FISHING
one [fm3,-s] day , my brother and I decided to go [vp1,1-1] fish.
some [fm3,-s] years ago we often went fishing by a small river ten kilometors [fm1,-] away from my home.
the [fm3,-s] river wasn't wide but the water was very clear and the river was rich in fishes many fishing fans used to go there for a good catch.
we [fm3,-s] set off very early that merning [fm1,-] .
at [fm3,-s] about seven o'clock we got to the river.
But what we saw there surprised us very much.
We couldn't find any people there istead [fm1,-] we saw rubbish everywhere.
On the surface of the river twated [fm1,-] something dirty and dead fish.
what's [fm3,-s] more, there was a foul smell.
We wordered [fm1,-] how fish can live in such water.
After we got out our fishing-tackle, we began to fish.
we [fm3,-s] waited and waited.
More than two hours passed but still no fish was caught.
how [fm3,-s] disappointed we were!
At last we couldn't stand the terrible smell any longer and had to go home.
AN INTERESTING English Party
last [fm3,-s] Saturday, our grade hold [vp6,s] an interesting English Party.
All of our grade students took part in the English Party.At 3:00 in the afternoon .
The English Party began.
The students who [wd5,2-3] in our grade took part in it.
some [fm3,-s] teachers who taught English in different grades took part in it, too.
In the party, the students who [wd5,s] in different classes give [wd3,s-] us some very good programmes.
There were English songs, plays dialogues, stories and so on.
Their good programmes make [vp6,s] everyone here very happy and glad.
Sometimes a student should [fm1,-] loudly "well [fm3,-1] .
Done [fm3,1-] !
" "OK, it's great!
" sometimes [fm3,-s] the teacher laughed, too.
The English party lasted two hours.
It was over successfully.
After that I though [fm1,-] this party is very useful and very good for us.
it [fm3,-s] make [vp3,1-] us were interested in English .
It was a good place where we studied English.
I hoped it could be hold [vp4,2-] every year.
I hoped it was more better [aj3,1-] and better.
MY HOMETOWN
long [fm3,-s] long ago, my hometown was a very beautiful place.
There is [vp6,d] a river which was light [cc4,3-] and had kinds of fishes.
On the edge of the river, there were a lot of trees.
People not only could have a fish in the river, but also could go swimming in it.
the [fm3,-s] land which was by the side of the river of the soil [wd7,s-] was very good.
people [fm3,-s] lived happily here.
But one day some people came here and built lots of factories.
They made the river become dirty and the river went had [wd7,3-] day after day.
they [fm3,-s] cut down trees, so that the soil often [ad1,s-] was washed into river by raining.
At [wd3,-2] a result, the land was to good [wd7,4-2] than before.
There was no longer fish in the river.
everything [fm3,-s] in the town had changed.
The nature was destroied [fm1,-] .many [fm3,-s] years later, a man which [pr5,2-3] was a scientist came here.
He called for everyone in the town to protect the nature.
At first, the unknown men didn't belive [fm1,-] him, but he didn't give up.
by [fm3,-s] his hard work .
People could belive [fm1,-] him and support him.
then [fm3,-s] the scientist made a fair programme.
All of town's people made such a good effort that the nature became better, but it is not very good.
A few years later, when the nature become [vp6,s] the best .
People made a rule to protect the nature.
If you a boy [wd7,3-1] it.
you will be punished.Now, the river is turned green again.
The fish begin to appear in the river, too.
the [fm3,-s] crops grow ever better.
every [fm3,-s] morning .
When you get up.
you can live in the clean air.
I'm very happy, because it become [vp3,1-] so beautiful.
I also thank [vp1,-4] the scientist to help us.I love my hometown!
I hope it's always like this.

But the old man didn't know that [wd3,s-] the Frenchman wanted.
Then the Frenchman stopped a sailor.

after [fm3,-s] a few days, the old lady telephoned her daughter and said, "Mary, there is one thing I do not understand: why do I have to go to bed to make tea?
can't [fm3,-s] I have tea in the afternoon or in the evening?
WHY DO I PLAY THE CLARICET [fm1,-] 
I have played the clarinet for over 6 years.
I have found I had interested [wd2,2-] in playing it.
when [fm3,-s] I was very young, there was a small field by the east to my home .
when [fm3,-s] we had finished our supper, my dad often took me to [wd5,2-1] there, I found my dad often took a strange black things [np3,3-] every times [np3,1-] , and when I was playing, my dad was playing it.
at [fm3,-s] that time, I only knew that it's [wd3,1-3] name is "clarinet".
When I became a pupil, there was a "New Year's Party" every year in our school.
At that time, I found a very serious problem.
The actors of the party are [vp6,s-] all the girls in the whole!
If it had the boys were all appered [fm1,-] with another leading players [np3,2-] .
I was very sad at that time, so from then on, I wasn't willing to see the dance, the piano playing or the also [wd7,s-] by girls and so on.
at [fm3,-s] that time, I think [vp6,4-2] "why do the boys couldn't put on [wd4,s-] and act the programmes [cc3,2-] ?......Hmm!
one [fm3,-s] day , I must mount on the stage, and tell the girls: 'the [fm3,-s] boys are also good on the stage!
" when [fm3,-s] I was very young, I had [wd3,1-2] interested in music very much.
At that time, I had no tape but my neighber [fm1,-] had one.
so [fm3,-s] I often went to his home and listened to the music.
my [fm3,-s] mother found I had interested in it.
she [fm3,-s] bought a new tape for me.
I was very happy.when [fm3,-s] I was a pupil in Grade 4, my father had begun to teach me to play the clarinet.
At first, I was very sick of it.
but [fm3,-s] after more and more years, I found it was very interesting.
because [fm3,-s] I could playing [vp9,1-] many songs.but [fm3,-s] it isn't the importance [wd2,-] .
I have acted 49 times.
I found my diathesis have improved [vp6,s-] more and more.
I think that is the most importance [wd2,2-] .
At cast [wd7,1-3] , I must say, I have played the clarinet for 6 years, I must play it again and again.
and [fm3,-s] I have been a [np7,-2] important actor in our school I think, the boys are also good on the stage!
IN SCHOOL BOYS AND GIRLS ARE LEARNING FOREIGN LAUGUAGES [fm1,-] 
do [fm3,-s] you know how many language [np3,3-] these [wd3,-s] are in the world?
these [wd3,-s] [fm3,-s] are about one thousand five hundred, but many of them are not very important.
English is one of the most important .
languages because so many people use it not only in England and America, but in other countries of the world.
About 320,000,000 speak it as their own language, and another 200,000,000 use it as a second language.
It is difficult to say how many people are learning it.
millions [fm3,-s] of boys and girls in schools are trying to do so.many [fm3,-s] English children study French.
French is also a very important language.
Some children study German.
Russian, Japanese and Chinese.which [fm3,-s] is the best way to learn a language?
We know that we all learnt our own language well when we were children.
We learn a second language in the same way.
It won't seem so difficult.
How does a small child ?
It listens to what people say and it tries to guess what it hears.
when [fm3,-s] it wants some thing [fm2,1-] .
it has to ask for it.
it [fm3,-s] is using the language, thinking in it and talking in it all the time: if people use a second language all the time, they will learn in quickly.
In school, you learn to read to write to hear and to speak.
it [fm3,-s] is best to learn all new words through the ear.
you [fm3,-s] can read them spell them and write them later.
WATER
water [fm3,-s] is very important to living things .
without [fm3,-s] water there can be no life on the earth.
all [fm3,-s] animals and plants need water.
Man also needs water.
We need water to drink to cook food and to clean ourselves.
Water is needed in offices.
Factories and schools .
Where else is water needed?
water [fm3,-s] covers most parts of the earth.
There is water in seas.
rivers and lakes.
Water is found almost every where [fm2,1-] .
Even in the driest part of the world there is some water in the air.
you [fm3,-s] cannot see it or feel it when it is the part of air.
The water in seas, rivers and lakes is a liquid.
the [fm3,-s] water in the air is not a liquid but a gas.
we [fm3,-s] call it water vapour.
clouds [fm3,-s] are make [vp9,2-2] of water, they may be made of little drops of water.
They may also be made of snow crystals [cc1,1-] .
snow [fm3,-s] crystals [cc1,1-] are little crystals of ice.
ice [fm3,-s] is frozen water or water that has become solid.Water, you have found out.
May be a solid, or a liquid, or a gas .
When it is a liquid, you can pour it out of a cup when it is a gas, you cannot see it or feel it.

sixteen [fm3,-s] years old has the beautiful season sixteen years old is also full of ideals.

I thought [vp6,d] so.

when [fm3,-s] I was a primary school pupil.
I have a good teachers .
he [fm3,-s] is my mathes [fm1,-] teacher my classmates and I often talked about he [pr4,1-] after class.
Because of [pp1,1-s] he has a serious face.
that [fm3,-s] many be so .One day "doing...... the alarm of the clock wake [vp6,s-] me up.
I opened my eyes and looked at the clock.
"OH, my gosh!
It's seven o'clock!

" I thought.
I jumped out of bed, washed my face, then hurried, to school without breakfast.
On my way to school it began to rain hard.When I got to the door of the [wd5,3-3] our class room .
I was all wit [wd3,3-3] and shivering with cold.
our [fm3,-s] mathes [fm1,-] teacher had already gegun [fm1,-] his lesson.
It was a Mr Wu he [pr1,-] was about fifty years old.
I was a little afraid of him.
I hesitated for a moment before I pushed the door.
"I am very sorry, Mr Wu, I am late, again.
" I said with a red face.
"Oh , it's you again.
" Mr Wu said sternly.
"I've told you not to be late but you......" he suddenly stopped and looked at my wet clothes.
He turned to the class and said," I'm very sorry my boys and girls.

he [fm3,-s] said kindly.I went to my seat with my teachers [np4,1-1] jacket it was a bit big for me but I felt very warm in it to my surprise, I found for the first time, mathes [fm1,-] was [wd5,1-3] became so interesting and how well I couldn't forgot it.
VISITING MR WANG
Mr Wang was my English teacher.
he [fm3,-s] was an old man but he was very healthy.
he [fm3,-s] always had a strange way to make his lessons interesting.
with [fm3,-s] the help of him, we had made progress.
But I found idioms and useful expressions hard to learn.
So I had a talk with Mr Wang about learning English.
I asked.
"Excuse me, Mr Wang.
my [fm3,-s] grammar is improve [vp9,2-] , but I find idioms and useful expressions hard to learn.
"Mr Wang said with a kind voise [fm1,-] , "not [fm3,-1] really.
often [fm3,-s] the little words have meanings of their own, you should learn them by heart.
when [fm3,-s] you don't understand it [pr3] , you can try to guess the meaning from the rest of the sentence.
" I heard what he said and then asked, "but [fm3,-s] how to use [wd4,2-2] English language?
I couldn't use it freely.
"Mr Wang smiled and said.
"do [fm3,-s] you know the story of Karl Marx ?
""I don't think so.
" I said.
he [fm3,-s] said, "Marx could master many foreign language [np3,2-] .
in [fm3,-s] one of his books .
Marx gave some advice on how to learn a foreign language.
He said when people are learning a foreign language .
They should not translate everything into their own language.
if [fm3,-s] they do this, it shows they haven't mastered it.
when [fm3,-s] they use the foreign language, they should try to forget all about their own.
if [fm3,-s] they cannot do this, they have not really learned the spirit of the foreign language and cannot use it freely.
" After the talk, I found my English study was improving.
I'm sure that I can make great progress.

AN EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA
the [fm3,-s] Chinese people will never forget the biggest earthquake in Tang shan [fm2,1-] , in 1976.
The whole city was almost destroyed and 750,000people died in the earthquake.
In the late night of July 28th, 1976 .
A terrible noise like a thunder was suddenly heard.
Fires and smoke were seen all over the city.
houses [fm3,-s] and tall buildings fell down.
I was having my summer holidays with my uncle in Tang shan [fm2,1-] .
I had never been in an earthquake before.
So I felt terribly afraid and cried loudly.
my [fm3,-s] uncle got me out at once.
A part of his house fell down.
Most of the things were broken.
It was lucky that my uncle and were not body hurt.
but [fm3,-s] our neighbours were not as lucky as we were.
they [fm3,-s] were killed in the earthquake.today [fm3,-s] , we have rebuilt Tang shan [fm2,1-] and made it more beautiful.
but [fm3,-s] I do hope we can do some thing [fm2,1-] later to stop earthquakes.
Or at least we'll make them do less harm to people on the earth.
FISHING
one [fm3,-s] day, my brother and I decided to go fishing.
Some years ago we after [wd5,1-s] went fishing by a small river ten kilometers away from my home.
The river wasn't wide but the water was very clear.
had [fm3,-s] [wd7,-s] the river was rich in fishes.
Many fishing fans used to go there for a good catch.
We set off very early that morning.
At about seven o'clock we got to the river.
but [fm3,-s] what we saw there surprised us very much.
We could [wd4,d] fund [fm1,-] any 0eople [fm1,-] there.
instand [fm1,-] [fm3,-s] we saw rubbish every where [fm2,1-] .
On the surface of the river floated some thing [fm2,1-] dirty and dead fish.
What's more there was a foul smell.
We wondered how fish could live in such water.
After we got out our fishing-tackle, we began to fish.
We waited and waited.
More than two hours passed but still no fish was caught.
how [fm3,-s] disappouned [fm1,-] we were!
At last we could not stand the terrible smell any longer and had to go home.
It was awful that with the derelopment [fm1,-] of our industry, more and more rivers were being polluted .
we [fm3,-s] must do something to prevent our rivers from being polluted.

YESTERDAY ONCE MORE
when [fm3,-s] I was young, I'd listen to the radio, waiting for my favorite songs.
When they played I'd sing along [cc5,1-] , it make [vp6,s-] me smile.Those were such happy times and not so long ago.
how [fm3,-s] I wondered where they'd gone.
Now they're back again, just like a long lost friend.
Every song contains a story, a beautiful story, a sad story.
This was a sad song, a sad story.
It can really make my [pr4,1-1] cry.
just [fm3,-s] like me.
Looking back on how it was in years gone by , and the good tomes [wd7,3-3] that I had makes today seen [wd7,s-] rather sad.
so [fm3,-s] much has changed.
In the past I was a lively girl.
I was very very happy.
Now I changed [vp6,s] [wd4,-] a serious girl, with out [fm2,1-] smile on my face.
Because of this life .
I hoped [vp6,-s] that I could go back to before, but I can't.
I could not face my future.
what [fm3,-s] should I do?
I needed [vp6,d] help very much.
It helped me.
it [fm3,-s] gave me a good idea.
Now, I change [vp6,-] [pp1,-] a ripe girl.
I am working hard in order to fill of my life, I am not sad at small things.
my [fm3,-s] life are [vp3,2-3] full of live [wd2,-] .
I am very happy.
THE FAMOUS [wd4,-] OF WOULDS [fm1,-] 
there [fm3,-s] are three of the biggest man-made projects in the would [fm1,-] .
they [fm3,-s] are the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt and the Aswan High Dam which is also in Egypt.First, the Great Wall of China was built during the Qi and the Ming periods.
In those periods, the Emperox [fm1,-] and Empress had made lots of labour force to build the defence line in order to resist the foreign invader [np6,s-] .
They didn't know the live [wd2,2-3] of the people in country city [cc1,-] , town and village [np6,2-] .After that, many peasant [np3,1-] had rase [fm1,-] up during [pp1,-] every year.
So the Emperor let the army to suppress the uprising.
of the peasant were failed.
They must do a lot of labour for the Emperor.
What a pity [cc7,2-2] of them!
During the Qi period, the Great Wall was built a little part of the Great Wall .
because [fm3,-s] of the wars during the period, most of the Qi Wall was distoried [fm1,-] by people.
during [fm3,-s] the Ming period, the Emperor made [vp1,-5] people building the great Wall.
so [fm3,-s] the Great Wall which you looked [vp6,s-] at is bigger and longer then [fm1,-] the Qi Great Wall.
today [fm3,-s] , the Great Wall was [vp6,s-] from Shan hai [fm2,1-] to Jia yu [fm2,1-] .
there [fm3,-s] are lots of nations people [cc1,1-] lived [vp6,s-] there and they were growing many plants for their life.
I love the Great Wall, because it solidified the wisdom and hard-working [wd2,s-] of the Chinese.
GREAT CHINA AND GREAT CHINESE PEOPLE
everybody [fm3,-s] , I think you all know the Chinese history.
yes [fm3,-s] , China is a very.
very great country, which is one of the oldest of fours [wd7,-] in the world.
now [fm3,-s] , I want to talk some thing [fm2,1-] about China.
At [wd5,-4] about 1,700,000 years ago Chine [fm1,-] had already had the people, which were called Yuan Mou [fm2,1-] people.
So it was the earliest in China.
as [fm3,-s] their life, it was lasted [vp7,s-] very long time.In the 2100s BC, one people who called [vp7,s-] Qi had built [wd4,3-2] Xia period [wd3,3-] , which was the first period [wd3,s-] in China.
it [fm3,-s] was the first slavery country.
It disappeared in about 770- 476BC, which contained [wd4,-1-5] Xia, sheng [fm3,1-2] Zhou periods [wd3,s-] and so on.in [fm3,-s] the [wd5,1-2] 475-221 BC, China built the other period [wd3,s-] , which [wd4,1-3] called [vp7,s-] Zhan Guo [fm2,1-1] period [wd3,2-] .
it [fm3,-s] was the first Feng Jian [fm2,1-1] country.
in [fm3,-s] 230- 221 AD, Yeng Zheng destroued [fm1,-] others [wd2,1-1] country [np3,s-] , and built the first whole country, which called [vp7,s-] [wd4,1-1] Qin period [wd3,2-] .
He was believed the greater politcal [fm1,-] leader.
At last, the Feng Jian [fm2,1-] period disappeared at the [wd5,1-2] 1912 AD.
The last period [wd3,-s] was [wd4,1-2] Qing period [wd3,2-] .
So the Feng Jia [fm2,1-] society was the longest time [wd5,s-] in Chinese history, which contained [wd4,2-6] Qin, Han, Shang, Ming, Yuan, Qing period [np6,s-] [wd3,s-] and so on.
on [fm3,-s] [wd3,-s] the world there is no country as the [wd5,3-1] China.what [fm3,-s] a great country!
what [fm3,-s] a great people!I love you -my China!
Spring is [wd4,2-3] very beautiful season of the year.
At this time, the animal and plant grow faster.
Today our teacher lead [vp3,3-] us to climb a mountain which called [vp7,s-] Qiu Shan [fm2,1-] and [wd5,s-] for a picnic.
today [fm3,-s] is a lovely day.
we [fm3,-s] leave early in the morning before it gets too hot.
we [fm3,-s] are getting there by bicycle, I think it is a "long trip", on the way to [wd5,3-1] there we are singing talking, making joke [np6,1-] , soon we are arrived [vp7,3-5] at the foot of the hill, the moutain [fm1,-] is very tall.
And at the top of the moutain [fm1,-] there is a red flag.
Our teacher told us [vp6,d] .
who [fm3,-s] is first pick the red flag, who is a number.
Few minutes later, all of us standing [vp4,d] [wd4,s-] the starting lines [np6,s-] and the teacher shouted:" ready [fm3,-1] , go.
" and [fm3,-s] we shoulder to shoulder run to the hill, when we reached the half way up the mountain, I began [vp1,1-s] felt very tried [fm1,-] and a bit afraid.
If we [wd4,1-4] not careful we can [vp6,s-] fall.
Finally we reached the top of the moutain [fm1,-] , we shouts of joy .
We are [vp6,d] very happy.
There is [vp6,d] a quite beautiful blue sky.
green trees and grass.
Yellow flowers and so on .
I have never see [vp9,3-1] it before.
We only stay [vp6,d] there one have, about 11:00a.m.
we began [vp1,1-2] go down the hill and at the foot of the hill we have [vp6,s-] a picnic, which cooked [vp7,s-] by ourself [fm1,-] .Today I am in a cheerful frame [cc4,1-2] of mind.

The People's Republic of China had been founded for forty-six years.
Tomorrow -- Oxtober [fm1,-] 1 is our National day.
Everybody in China [vp3,3-1] know this.
It's necessary for everyone to love his own homeland.
We must do so.

I was wearing [np6,3-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with short [np6,3-3] sleeve at that time.

When I got to the classroom, I found that many of my classmates were wearing [np6,1-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with long [np6,5-0] sleeve.
thought:" Why didn't I wear [np6,1-1] the clothing [wd3,2-3] with long [np6,2-0] sleeve?
How silly I am!
" It gets colder and colder.
After a while, the classmate who sat by my side [vp6,6-4] take off her outer clothing and said: "Would you like to put on my clothing?
I don't feel cold now.
" "Thank you!

And I put on the clothing.

If they wouldn't be careful, they would [wd7,1-2] plus a "printing" on their sole.

They are the most expensive for us.
You'll have a lot of trouble if you are not able to see .

And [pr1,1-5] it'll live in a black world.
If you are [wd2,3-0] nearsightedness, then you'll be [wd1,3-3] not able to see the distinct things without glasses.
So we must cherish our eyes.
Ordinarily, we must not read in a dark place, and don't read in the sun, and don't read when we are walking, and don't read in bed.

For I'm a common person, I was unhappy in the heart of course.
However, I had straightened out my thinking after all.
It's good that I dare to join the match.

On the white cellophane paper, [vp3,0-3] there's some special characters.

Sea [fm3,-] [np7,-] is beautiful and mysterious.
I like it very much.
Light blue sea is my favourite.
When sunlight [vp3,2-4] shine on the limpid sea, seawater [fm1,-] [vp3,1-3] reflex much gold light.
If you put two wood chairs with simple moulding [fm1,-] on the seaside, let seawateer [fm1,-] soak the legs of the chairs.
You can fancy, the light yellow sand can be seen through the light blue gold seawater, and the two chairs.
What a beautiful tablean [fm1,-] !
And how romantic!
Won't anyone love it?
Dark blue sea is not so beautiful as light blue sea.
But it has its own graceful bearing.
It is a mature sea.
It always [vp3, 2-4] stretch out both warm arms, and [vp3,8-4] make people feel comfortable.
At night, the sea [vp3,2-1] become mysterious.
It is dark everywhere.
You [ad1,1-1] only can hear the sound that from the wave lash the rock.
Perhaps you can see the sea in the moonlight.
But it's so dim.
I think the sea in the evening is enjoyed with [wd3,-] ears.
Sea, the place which I yearn for is like a pretty girl.
And it will be a beauty for ever.

The Emperor's New Clothes
The procession finished.
The Emperor and the officials came back to the Palace.
the Emperor thought back the scene that happened just now, and felt very silly and angry.
Then he ordered the officials who had seen the "perfect new clothes" to wear that "new clothes" and walked in the Palace.
The officials had to be at his beck [fm1,-] and call [vp6,-] .
Then they walked [wd4,-] had nothing on.
The [fm3,-] Emperor looked at those men -- [fm3,-] They were so unsightly.
He thought, " I surely lost face just now!
People must think I'm a foolish man!
" He thought and thought.
Finally, he became mental because he thought too much.
So another man became the [fm3,-] Emperor.
And he was a very good emperor.
Then what about the old [fm3,-] Emperor?
He turned from side to side in front of the mirror every day, and hummed, " I'm so foolish.
I'm so stupid..." March 10 Sunday Rainy I'm a voracious person.
Why I aid so?
Well, let me tell you.
When I was still a little girl, I understand that English is a kind of interesting language.
Because it's not our own language.
It's strange for me.
In those days, I was eager to learn English.
Then I grew up.
I was studuying [fm1,-] English and can sing English songs.
I like English songs.
And then I found Japanese songs were good, too.
So I hoped to learn Japanese.
Many people said, " French is the most beautiful language in the world.
" With this sentence, my mind is perturbed again for foreign languages.
After this, I became wishing to learn all the foreign languages.
But I regretted that I had no spare time to learn them.
When you finish reading my article, do you think I am a voracious girl?
March 17 Sunday Cloudy I have several idols.
They are the singers in Hong Kong and Tai Wan -- Wang Faye, Leslie Zhang, Zheng Yijian, Jeff Zhang., Chen Jieyi...... And I like Wang Faye [wd7,4-0] vest.
Wang Faye has a good voice.
It sounds very clear and light .
And it's special.
I will be relaxed when I hear her songs.
She has not only actual strength , but also an outstanding surface.
Sometimes she combed her hair like the pineapple, wore the perspective dress.
Sometimes she cut the hair very short, then adhered some long hair.
And sometimes her attire is pure.
However, they are all [vp7,3-1] fit her.
Someone had ever said Wang Faye had her own way unduly.
Because she was of uncertain whereabouts, and refused the visitations.
It's too unfair that thet [fm1,-] said so.
Wang Faye is not good at [vp5,2-2] link up stranger all along.
And she [vp3, 1-4] don't like to tell others about her private matter.
Though the reporter asked her again and again.
She began to [vp1,3-0] detest.
And then often "be missing".
It made me only can hear her new songs a little time.
Faye, I will always support you .
You must sing more good songs for us!

They are the old woman's daughter and son-in-law.
They didn't [vp1,1-5] let SunYi to go to school without the old woman [vp5,4-1] implored them.
Sun Yi [cc4,2-3] very treasure [cc5,1-] the chance that she can study.
She kept the first three place [np6,-] in the class all along [wd3,-] .But her life is too suffering [aj1,-] .
She was forced to go to the Buddhist nunnery when she was just thirteen years old!
Afterwards, she left there for continuing her studying.
But it's still very bumpy.
For studying, she went to Xin Jiang thousands of li away to attend school.
She sold blood to take the money.
Though she had paid too much, her four [wd7,1-5] dreams that go to college were still shattered.
From 1988 to 1995, Sun Yi began to pubish [fm1,-] literary works.
And people recognized the worth of her.
At the same time, Sun Yi's grandmother died.
Sun Yi was very sad.
She told her grandmother, "I'll never live up to the kindness of you.
You must be proud of your choose [wd2,6-3] 22 years ago..." April 7 Sunday Cloudy Magic is a very marvellous [fm1,-] technique.
The famous magician David (How spell?
)'s magic is special [wd2,-] wonderful.
David bent over the "bed" which was made of metal on the stage.
Several persons locked him on the "bed" with 5 locks.
Then put some metallic board around him, and locked them like a box.
Everything was ready, the electric saw which [wd4,-] over him about 10 metres began turnning [fm1,-] round very fast and dropping slowly.
Sunddenly [fm1,-] , David opened the "box" and began untying the locks.
When he untied all the locks except one of them which [wd4,1-3] on his waist, the whole audience cried out --the electric saw had cut David!
The working personnels [fm1,-] pulled open the "bed", David's upper part of the body separated his lower part of the body.
People [vp1,1-1] gaped David.
David stirred his feet.
Clapping was sounded.
David [vp3,1-1] haven't died!
Then David made the times flow backwards.
finally, David had restored.
Besides, David had a lot of astonishing unique [np6,5-0] skill.
He can go through the Great Wall with his human body, fly without anything to depend on like a superman, let a lady pierce through his own body, [vp6,8-0] made the [wd4,2-3] or a plane or a train disappear in a very very [wd6,-] short time --about 30 seconds David, an outstanding magician, I admire him very much.

He was very frightened at the footprint.
He went home at once.
And looking behind now and then.

Soon after, Crusoe's dog died.
Crusoe [vp6, 1-1] [vp1,1-1] look it as his friend, he was very sad, and felt very lonely this time.
He sometimes thought, "Did I make the footmark myself?
" So he decided to go back to see the footmark.
On the sands, he tried his foot in it, but it was much larger than his own, [fm3,-] he feared, then went back home again.
Crusoe prepared seversal [fm1,-] guns and [np5,0-2] lots of gun-powder in his cave.
But he thought that it wasn't safe enough, so he went out and looked for a better hiding-place.
Finally, he found a cave with narrow entrance.
He went into it.
Sundenly [fm1,-] he saw two eyes glared at him in the darkness.
He hurried out into the daylight.
Crusoe stepped into the cave with a burning stick, and found out that two eyes he had seen was a dead goat's eyes.
He also found out there was a good hiding-place.
One day, Crusoe climbed up to his lookout.
He saw nine savages sitting round a fire on the shore.
There were two canoes near them.
It seemed that they were eating something.
As soon as the savages had gone, Crusoe fetched two guns from his home.
The two canoes were hardly able to see.
 [vp7,s] Crusoe went to the fire, found the bones of human being among the ashes.
He [fm3,-] made up his mind to kill the savages when they came again.
But no one [vp1,3-7] came the island again for a long time.
Youth
Youth is the bud on the branch in the gentle and soft spring.
It is full of fancy and hope, and it lets the young affection drift in the green world.
Youth is the wave that [vp3,3-3] surge on the sands in the burning summer.
It is so lively, so fresh and cool, that can rinse your distress.
Youth is zeal that is permeated with the red leaves on the maple in the desolate autumn.
We are going to sing for youth.
Youth is the snow in the cold winter.
It is pure, sparkling and crystal-clear, and it makes this world very very [wd6,-] pretty...
The Story Of William Tell
William Tell came to Altorf with his little son.

Because Switzerland was ruled by Austria.
The Austrian governor, Gessler, [vp1,0-7] ruled with a firm hand to the Swiss.
People were ordered to bow before the pole which was placed Gessler's hat on.
William Tell knew about it, but he would not bow.
So he was caught to Gessler.
Willian Tell hadn't [vp5,3-1] bow yet.
Gessler was very angry.
He thought out a cruel plan to punish Tell.
He ordered Tell to shoot at the apple which was on his own son's head one hundred paces away.

My first teacher
People always said, "The first lover is unforgettable.
" I think the first teacher is unforgettable, too.
My first teacher was [np7,1-4] an [wd4,1-3] about 50-year-old Chinese teacher.
We called her Mrs. Jean.
Mrs Jean was tall, vigorous and serious.
We feared her very much.
At that time, we thought Mrs. Jean was partial.
She liked the boy monitor [ad1,5-0] especially.
When the boy monitor had made a mistake, she always didn't gave him a heavy punishment.
We thought that's unfair.
But nobody deared [fm1,-] to say that.
Afterwards, Mrs Jean went to another school.
On the contrary, we began missing her.
Then we went to see her on one Sunday.
We felt Mrs. Jean was affectionate in fact.
But Mrs. Jean had been away.
We had to bless her far away.
The senseless cheap trick The day before yesterday, I heard from a letter.
At first, I was very surprised.
Who would write to me?
I opened it.
Oh, it was the cheap trick which had continued for several years.

He (she) asked me to make 20 carbon copies and send them to my friends in 9 days.
And he (she) [vp3,2-2] illustrate with examples if I sent them on time, I would be lucky; if I hadn't sent them on time or left them at home, I would have bad luck.
In fact, my friends have ever [wd3,4-5] heard from this kind of letters several years ago.
Some of them copied and sent the letters.
But they hadn't got rich.
Some of them [vp6,3-3] throw the letter away.
But they are all right all along.
I don't know why the people thought of such a cheap trick.
But I think these people are senseless.
I wish they won't do that again.
At he same time, I hope no one will be silly to copy these letters.
Carve the boat to find sword Long long [wd6,-] ago, A man went across the river.
Suddenly, his sword slipped down from the sheath, then dropped into the river.
The man carved a mark on the boat immediately and said, 'My sword dropped from here.

On the contrary, we must act accordinmg [fm1,-] to circumstances.
Then we will be clever boys and girls.

And for many years, Guangzhou was a good place to [vp1,4-0] live.
The streets [vp6,2-1] are [vp6,-] clean.
The parks were safe.
The people were friendly.
But Guangzhou changed.
Today the streets aren't clean.
The parks aren't safe.
The population is increasing.
The reason [pr5,2-3] which [vp6,3-3] [wd3,3-2] made this change is the other provinces people.
They thought Guangzhou is a very good place to make money.
So lots of them [vp6,4-2] came to Guangzhou to work.
The increasing population [vp6,3-2] made rubbish increase, [fm3,-] Because not all of them can be invited so some people go to steal or rob.
This [vp6,1-1] made Guangzhou not safe.
I think they are too disgusting to stay here.
Oct.12 Saturday Sunny
Strong Teachers
Today is the day which we [vp6,5-5] had waited for a long time.
The [fm1,-] sporters [fm1,-] and other students prepared for everything, attended the sports [wd3,1-0] meeting happyly [fm1,-] .
This sports meeting is especially wonderful.
Because the teachers also attended the sports meeting.
For example, our Chinese teacher Mr Zhu shot put, our English teacher Miss Lin shot put, too.
And our history teacher, maths teacher, chemistry teacher and physics teacher ran.
We were difficult to imagine that [wd7,0-2] out gentle teacher would [wd4,1-2] so strong on the sports ground !
In the end, Mr Zhu won the champion.
Our teacher who [wd7,3-1] relaid [fm1,-] race got No.1.
Our physics teacher won the second place in long [np6,2-0] jump.
Though other teachers haven't won any [np6,2-0] prize, they are still worth praising.
You are the best!
Our lovely teachers!
Oct.19 Saturday Sunny I have ever heard something interesting about two presidents (I don't remember if this is their position) of England and the United States.
One day, the two presidents made an appoiment [fm1,-] with each other.
When they were talking, the American president wanted to go to toilet, so he said, "Excuse me, where's John?
" John meant toilet in America.
But the English president didn't know.
He answered,"John?
No one is called 'John' here."...
Oh, what an interesting thing!
ct.26 Saturday Sunny Half a month ago, Miss Lin and Mr Yang came.
After half a month, they left us.
On the day that they said good-bye to us, all of us were unhappy.
And we sent them two cards and presents.
They were moved.
Miss Lin gave us a letter with tears in her eyes.
Mr Yang wrote several sentences on the blackboard, " I go quietly, as I came quietly.
I waved my sleeve, and took away the rosy clouds.
" Don't be so sad, our teachers.
We'll meet again some day.
And we'll not forget you.
Nov.2 Saturday Sunny Easier said than done "Jack!
" Jack's mother called out in the kitchen.
"Don't watch TV any more.
You must go over for your tomorrow's test.
" "Don't worry, Mum.
English is very easy for me.
" But a few days later, the teacher announced that Jack had failed in the exam.
It is always easier to be said than to be done.
If you don't go over the lessons, you won't get a good grade.
Hard work leads to success.
You won't say "that's easy" before you do.
Remember, easier said than done!
 [fm1,-] ov.23 Saturday Sunny The sport that I like I didn't like sport formerly [wd3,4-0] .
But I like watching sports match.
Because I admire the [fm1,-] sporters [fm2,-] .
I began to like sports since [vp6,5-3] I'm in grade two.
Because I began to play table tennis and volleyball.
I found them very amusing.
But they are not my favourate [fm1,-] sports.
I like playing badminton best.
It can keep me fit, make me happy.
And it [wd4,1-5] also good for our health.
I'm trying to like other sports.
Nov.30 Saturday Sunny
English is the most widely spoken in the world.
It is spoken as a first language by people in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
But it is also very useful in many other countries in the world.
If you travel in India, or France, or Germany, or any other [np6,2-0] country, you will be able to speak English.
It is used by people all over the world.
That's why we are learning English in China.
It is one of the world's most important languages because it is so widely used.
So we must learn English hard.
Dec.6  Friday  Sunny
The Professor And His Invention Professor
Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the government.
One day, two men from London were going to take his invention papers to the government.
But on their way to the Professor's Office, they were shut by two cheats.
The two cheats wanted to [cc3,5-2] cheat the invention and sell it.
so [fm3,- ] they went to the office imposting [fm1,-] the two man from London.
But Professor Hunter didn't trust them because their action [vp3,1-0] were so strange.
So he gave another paper to them .
And he decided to take his papers to London himself in order that his papers wouldn't be cheat [wd3,3-1] again.
Dec.14 Saturday Sunny Don't waste time Some students often waste their time.
They spent too much of their time in playing games, watching TV and doing other things.
But they didn't understand they had done wrong.
And they said that they didn't have enough time to do their homework and prepare their lessons.
They didn't know how to make good use of their time at all.
Many people know that time is life.
Time [vp3,1-1] pass quickly.
And time is very precious.
We must take care of time and remember that time is more precious than money.
The Winter Holiday Every student always [wd5,2-5] wishes to have a holiday.
Because there is so much homework to do.
It's so tiresome.
Now, the Winter Holiday comes, and the homework comes together .We had thought to relax in the holiday.
But the dream is brokn [fm1,-] .
Though I'll do it carefully.
I must study hard [ad1,4-0] always.
I hope I can make progress in the next term.
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival comes.
It makes people so happy.
They can visit their old [np6,2-0] friend, eat many [np5,2-0] food, and wear new clothes.
The children are [aj3,3-0] happiest.
Because they can get much lucky-money.
Then they can buy some [np6,1-3] toy or some food.
So they always follow their parents to go here and there .
But when they grow up, they won't do [fm2,-] that again.
Because they feel shy.
Later, they will give lucky-money to the children instead of [vp5,2-1] get lucky-money.
Over 2000 years ago, there lived a farmer in the State of Song.
In his field stood the stump of a tree.
One day while the farmer was ploughing [fm2,-] , he saw a hare, it was running fast across his field.
Suddenly the hare bumped against the stump, and died on the ground.
Then the farmer put down his plough, hurried to walk up to the stump and picked it up.
He was very happy.
From then on, the farmer stayed at the stump, he wanted to [vp1,0-3] wait the hare [vp5,3-2] die from bumping the stump again.
He waited and waited.
To his disappointment, no [np6,1-2] hare come again.
It was raining this morning.
This afternoon I was on my way to [wd4,4-2] aunt's home.
And I saw a woman with a little boy near e. An old woman was waiking [fm1,-] in front of us.
The street was wet and slippery.
Suddenly the granny fell down.
The little boy ran to help her and took her to the other side of the road with the woman.
Then when the granny felt well to thank them, the little boy's face turned red.
They helped the granny get on the bus and went away.
What a kind boy he is!
Today is sunny.
My mother [vp1,0-4] goes to shopping with me.
We're going to shangxiajiu street.
Shangxiajiu street is the first street where we can walk on foot in Guang Zhou.
Many shops are opened from morning till night.
They are doing good business.
On the street, there are some monopoly shops.
As the saying goes, "Eat in Guang Zhou.
" So the food of the Guang Zhou Hotel [vp3,6-1] are delicious.
There is onluy [fm1,-] one book shop on the street.
It's so unfair!
Books are very important to us.
Book [np6,1-4] shop should be built more [wd1,s-] !
Guang Zhou is coming [fm2,-] stronger and stronger.
March 15 Saturday Sunny
Which ache do you fear most?
Headache or others?
But to me, it's toothache.
I think toothache is so bad.
It maked [fm2,-] me have unclear enunciation because my tongue would touch my swelling gum.
It makes me depressed because smiling [vp6,5-0] was so difficult to me at that time.
And the most trouble thing is that I couldn't eat more food.
I was so poor that I had suffered severely from a lingerling [fm1,-] toothache for one and a half weeks!
My friends!
You must take good care of [pr4,4-1] you teeth.
April 13  Sunday  Rainy
Some students would be sad when they got a bad result in the exam.
They usually scold themselves, "Why did I get such a result?
" "How foolish I am!"...
But in fact, can this improve their score?
The answer must be "No".
At this time, what they must do is to study harder.
They must [cc3,2-3] listen to the lesson more carefully, go over the text, and do more exercises.
"Everyday is a new day.
" Don't be sad for [pr4,4-3] you failure any more.
Be active in our studying, and you will be successful!
April 20   Sunday  Cloudy
Many students have their idols3, Most of them are the [np6,2-2] singer in Hong Kong.
These days, many singers in Hong Kong sing very bad.
But there are still many fans [vp5,5-1] support them.
Why they are so popular?
They just depend on their [np6,1-0] face, their [np6,1-0] body, their clothes, their hair, and so on.
But can they know what is music?
I think they should do more practice, and struck their fans with their good voice.

The winter [wd3,2-2] holiday was short, but I felt happy yet [wd5,3-0] .
Over eating and drinking
The day which I stayed at grandparents' home with my cousin is the happest [fm1,-] day.
But it was [np7,2-2] a " unfortunate" day for me too.
I ate too much.
When I [vp6,5-3] go back to [wd5,2-1] home, I had a stomachache.
I went to the toilet several times that night.
The feeling was not good.
I couldn't have [np5,3-2] a greasy food in two days.
I would remember this thing and [vp9,0-4] dare not to [fm2,-] over [vp5,4-1] eating again.
Buy book
Before [fm3,-] Several years [np7,2-1] the people didn't like buying [np6,3-0] book in the Spring Festival.
Beacuse [fm1,-] the " [np4,2-1] book"'s pronunciation was the same as the "lose".
But this year was different, [fm3,-] [np7,0-4] the peope [fm1,-] like buying [np6,4-4] book in the Spring Festival.
In the buying book centre [cc4,3-] of Tian He, a lot of people [vp6, 12-2] was buying [np6,2-0] book.
They don't think this is taboo.
It announced [wd3,2-4]  [np7,2-1] the knowledge was important in [np7,2-2] the people's heart [wd3,2-0] and [np7,0-2] the people's idea was changed.
Den Xiao Ping's Death
Den Xiao Ping, the outstanding leader of our country died on Feb. 19, 1997.
He is the designer of socialism reformation and modernize [wd2,3-1] building.
It is [fm2,-] DenXiaoPing that [vp3,2-8] make [np7,1-2] the people live a warm and full living [wd3,5-] .
Hong Kong and Macao can [vp9,s] come back to china [fm3,-] because of his theory of "Two [np6,1-3] system in one country".
With his trying, the relation between [fm3,-] china and [np7,5-2] the other countries were improved.
Chinese economy's developing was looked with new eyes by the developed [np6,2-0] country and the developing [np6,2-0] country.
So the chinese [fm3,-] people were very sad when we heard the news of Den's death.
Each of us would remember him for ever .
A student as we are, we will study hard in order that we can make our country become a rich, strong, [wd7,4-1] culture country at an early date.
This is comrade Den's hope too.
 [fm2,-] DenXiaoPing will immortalize!
"Black" board
Some changes [vp6,2-2] had taken place in the blackboard of our classroom.
The blackboard [vp6,2-4] was not black and [vp6,4-1] turn white.
Teachers [vp6,1-3] didn't need to write on the blackboard in chalk.
The chalk's powder [vp6,3-2] didn't fly everywhere.
It could keep the teachers and students healthy.
 [cj1,0-10] Although it has some little [wd3,3-5] problems in the class sometimes, but I think it unimportant.
 [fm3,-] we will [vp1,2-1] comefort [fm1,-] and like it before long.
Hong Kong comes back
Hong Kong will come back to china [fm3,-] after one hundred days.

We [vp6,1-8] had ever [ad3,-] written the composition in the winter holiday.
During the course of writing [np6,5-0] composition I have read a lot of materials.
They make me know the situations of the earth environment .
Our environment was no good than before and the natural resources [vp3,3-4] was reduced day by day.
 [np7,0-7] The people didn't pay attention to environment protection.
I often see that some rubbish such as peel plastic bag were thew [fm2,-] away by some people on the street.
As we know, a beautiful environment was closely [vp7,5-2] linked our living.
It's important for us to protect the environment Don't destory [fm1,-] the environment again!
Let's make a beautiful environment for our living!
Computers
When Charles Babbage, a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University, invented the first computer in 1812 .

Computers are being used more and more widely in many domains.
They can control machines in factories, manage amount in [np6,3-0] company, serve people in [np6,3-0] family.

People who play [np7,3-1] the tennis must judge the [np4,3-1] balls direction and consider how [wd4,2-1] play so that his opponent can not prevent.
Sometimes the match was very long.
It's time to test the player's physical strength and endurance.
He who has more endurance will win.
I was watching a tennis match between M. Chang and P. RAFRER in SALEM OPEN 1997 HONGKONG on Sunday.
M. Chang was well known by the people in Asia.
This was a wonderful match.
M. Chang displayed very good [ad2,1-] .
But when M. Chang [vp9,2-2] will win after his last ball in second [np6,6-0] game.
it [fm3,-] began to rain.
The match has to stop.
 [fm3,-] the last ball which [fm2,-] may be [vp3,4-2] decide the winner, It was a pity.

Because the mouse often runs after it.
The mouse was nmot [fm1,-] hood [fm1,-] thing lor [fm1,-] our living.
We must get rid of it.
flea [fm3,-] market
"Flea market" was a strange word for the Chinese people in the past.
But flea market was known by more and more people recently.
It was held in a lot of places.
I thought the man who invented the flea market was a great economist.
By this means, many things which would be thrown away or put into the storehouse can be recycled.
On Monday, a flea market was held in our school.
The students sold their things which they didn't need.
There [vp3,1-2] is reference books, toiesam [fm1,-] magazines, handiworks CD, VCD to be sold.

Trees are good to trees take in gases which are harmful to us and give out gases that are good to us.

and said a word.
Many classmates couldn't keed [fm1,-] [vp8,3-3] back their tears too [wd3,9-0] .
At last, Mr Yang said to us: "We were [vp6,1-4] so thanks [wd2,5-2] for you .
You're our first students in our teacher's lefe [fm1,-] .
We will never forget you.
Thank you.
Though they left, we would usually [wd3,2-5] think [vp1,3-2] them again.
Going to the doctor's We only go to the doctors when we are sick.
So the [np7,0-8] doctor makes money only if we are sick.
Consequently isn't it in the doctor's interest to wish everybody were [vp3,4-1] sick so e can make a lot of money?
I think doctors should only make money if we are healthy, [wd4,0-1] this way it would be in his interest to keep us healthy.
A national insurance program, I think, would achieve this resule [fm1,-] [cc3,2-0] since doctors can then be encouraged to prevent sickness from occuring [fm1,-] [vp7,3-0] .
Sunday       Sunny

It often appears in Summer [fm3,-] and Autumn [fm3,-] .
It is heart [vp2,2-3] that the wishes which promise [vp7,3-4] to the moving [np2,1-1] star will be realized.
I am very regreted [vp7,2-] that I have never caught sight of it.

This story of the play happened in [wd3,0-3] a professor's home.

At ten-thirty, two men came for the paper, But Mr Hunter.
didn't believe them and gave them other papers.
After a while, two policemen came and told professor the two men were cheats.
They kidnapped the true [wd3,3-1] men and took away their cards.
But Mr Hunter told them not to worry because he knew the true [wd2,3-0] at first and gave the men's paper were other papers.
This story was funny.

If you have many [np8,4-1] money, then you will have anything.
On the contrary, you have no money, so all the person [np6,4-2] were coldly.
My frist [fm1,-] teacher I'm sixteen years old now.
During my studying [wd3,3-1] life, there are [vp6,2-2] many teacher [wd6,4-] .
I want to say [wd3,4-4] about my first teacher.
In the Primary [fm3,-] School [fm3,-] , Miss Zhong was my class head [fm2,-] .
She is [vp6,2-3] a young woman.
In the first time [pp2,3-] , she told us she was thirty years old that year.
In the years that followed, we knew that he [wd3,1-] taught Chinese and she always was very kind of [wd3,6-1] us.
In the following two years, she never angrily [wd2,3-2] for [wd3,4-1] us.
She always smiled.
To we were Great [fm1,-1] Three, Miss Zhong left us.
We stated [fm1,-] to know some new teachers.
I remembered clearly, I had studied in the school for six years.
In the Spring Holiday [np6,3-] , she asked me to her office at once.
She gave me some cards and said "Happy new [fm3,-] year [fm3,-] " to me.
Everything time [cc1,1-] I was happily [wd2,3-] and thankful.
Now, I missed her very much.
Sometimes, I went back to the school and saw her.
She was still kind of [wd3,5-2] her pupils and more beautiful .
Today was very hot.
At about half past seven in the morning, I got up.
The sun was shining.
People walked quickly in the street.
For this Summer Holiday, today is [vp6,2-3] the second day.
I wanted to go to swim.
So I phone [vp6,s-] all my old school friends.
At nine o'clock.
I went to the swimming-pool by bike.
At the same time, I met John, my goods [fm1,-] friend for ten years.
Later, John, Mike, Mary.
They reached there, too.
We were [wd3,2-6] hand by hand [np2,3-] into it [pr1,1-] together.
We could see the wated [fm1,-] was green and clear.
Some friend [np6,2-] couldn't help jumping and laughing, they jumped into it at once .The others went to get some foods [np5,1-] and soft-drinks, put them near the swimming pool.
At last, we were jumped [wd5,3-3] into the water at all.
About two years [wd3,3-1] late [wd3,4-] ,we felt tired and hungry, so some were had a rest and said something to together.
Today, Everything [fm3,-] was beautiful.
My old school friend asked me to her home.
She said the [wd5,1-] she will gave [vp6,3-3] me a happiness [wd3,1-] .
So I was surprise [wd2,-] .
I want [fm1,-] to her home at once.
When I walked in, I saw a dog.
He shouted at me.
At this time [wd3,3-] , my friend came out, [fm3,-] She asked me with a smile "What do you think?
" I answered.
"That's great.
" Soon, we came in the house.
My friend told me that the dog was sent [wd3,4-4] by her brother's friend.
They named him "QQ".
I felt that "QQ' was very interesting.
he liked sleep [wd2,3-] on people's legs and alway [fm1,-] took the books on the floor.
Because he was only two years old, he must to [wd5,1-] drink milk.
he [fm3,-] loved smell [vp4,1-] the flowers and like [vp6,1-3] the white's particularly.
So my friend's parents put the white flowers near his house.
" In this day, "QQ" [wd4,1-5] already very kind of [wd3, 5-1] me and we made friend-ship [wd3,-] .
When I left, he followed me to the door.
It [pr1,1-] likes used [vp5,-] the tail to say good-bye to me.
In this Summer holiday, if you walk on a street, you will find some interesting things.
In the shop, it [pr1,1-] became large and more modernary [fm1,-] .
In the windows of children's clothes, some perents [fm1,-] with their children looked through the windows.
Their children always [wd5,3-5] ran and jump around it.
They picked out [wd5,1-] the latest modes [wd3,3-] of [wd3,1-1] them and told their father or mother.
Soon, with the new clothes, everyone left happily.
On the roadside, there are some people.
Everyday they came [vp6,3-2] here early.
Some are buying something, some are seeing [wd3,3-] , some are the boss .
I find that the clothes [wd4,2-4] more beautiful than before.
Of course some are much [wd3,3-1] expensive.
But all the people would wish nice themselves.
So they never make them disappointed together [wd3,-] .
China's four modenizations [fm1,-] will be reality [np7,-] .
People's living conditions is [vp3,4-1] improving.
We belive [fm1,-] that our country must [vp9,3-2] be lovely [cc6,-1] better in the future.
The new term have [vp3,4-1] come [vp6,5-3] [wd3,5-] three weeks ago.

You can find a lot of students study [vp5-] harder than before.
You will find in these day [np6, 3-] , classmates have become friendly.
Teachers are working harder.
So we felt thankful for it [pr1,1-] .
In [wd3,1-3] the teacher's day, every class in our school all [wd5,1-] are [vp3, 7-3] buy [vp6,8-2] some presents for our dear teachers.
When we sent it [pr1,1-] to our teachers, they looked happily [wd2, 1-] and suprised [fm1,-] .
In our heart, we hoped our teachers can [vp9,3-3] [wd4,3-3] beautiful and beautiful [aj3,3-] , become younger and younger.
they must be tired for us, So [wd4,1-1] hope them happy in [wd5,1-] everyday.
Today, I phoned [wd5,1-1] called my goods [fm1,-] friend -- the old classmate of the Primary School.
We have not seen [wd3, 4-4] for a long time.
So today, we felt having many words but could not say something [wd3,1-] .
He said [wd3,2-3] about the person [np6,2-] and something [wd3,1-3] we had remembered.
Much [np8,1-4] of the old classmates had changed.
Surely, concluding us.
We remembered what happed [fm1,-] between us all those day [np6,2-] .
Though the [wd5,1-1] time pass [vp6,4-1] by.
We [fm3,-] felt many [wd3,3-5] of the felling [fm1,-] have changed [vp3,8-2] each other, but we could not forget [wd4,-] "we are [vp6,2-2] good friends.
" We never said "forever", but we both know [vp6,4-] that the friend-ship [fm1,-] grows [vp6,3-3] up [wd5,4-2] with us, with the following [wd3,3-1] days.
Yesterday, I read an account [wd3,4-] that teach [vp6,4-1] people how to write with a pen on paper.
I felt that it is [vp6,2-1] useful for me after I read it.
First, It taugh [fm1,-] us how to pick a [np7,1-1] ordinary pen for writing.
It said that a thicker pen fiter [fm1,-] more than the [wd5,1-1] others.
It takes [vp6,2-1] us about a month to grasp a new pen's use [cc3,5-] .
It told person [cc3,3-] , we [pr1,4-] can [vp7,2-4] copy books' [pr4,-] good points.
Chinese characters is [vp3,3-] very interesting.
If our handwriting is good, so it [pr1,1-2] is [vp6,2-1] good for our study or work.
Some people's handwriting was [vp6,4-2] very good.
Not only be paised [fm1,-] by others, but also improve their D?D?.
We can see that, it is important to learn to write.
My handwriting was bad.
So I make up my mind to learn to write.
When my handwriting was [vp6,4-1] good, I think I can receive intereting [fm1,-] [cc3,6-] .
Yesterday, the two teachers of practice [vp1,1-] of our class left us.
They said good-bye to us.
At that time, many of the students could not keep back their tears.
All of us have felt [vp6,5-1] sad.
Because, the teachers have got well with [vp2, 6-1] us for these days.
Not only at [pp2,-2] the class, but also after class.
Before they left us, we sent the presents to them.
o the boy [wd3,3-4] was a beautiful watch, and to [wd3,3-4] the girl was a lovely toy.
So they felt happy.
As the teacher's [np4,3-1] letter was read in the class.
Student's couldn't keep back their tears again.
I think all the person [np6,3-3] are [wd5,6-2] have feeling [np6,6-] .
Nobody likes "Good-bye [fm3,-] ' But it was the ality [fm1,-] for us.
So we must keep back our tears at the quick speed [cc4,3-] ,and study harder than before.
It is the best present for our teachers.
I like swimming very much, because it can keep me fit.
When you [wd4,2-4] in the swimming-pool, you [wd4,1-3] through the water, the feeling was [vp6,3-1] good, you will feel soft.
 [cc5,-] I kow [fm1,-] two kinds of swimming.
I remembered, when I was six years old, my father went to the swimming pool with me once a week.
In that [wd3,2-1] days, I always feel [vp6,3-2] very happy.
When I saw the water, I will jumped [fm1,-] .
When I jumped into the water, I felt highest [ad3,-] [wd7,-] than before.
I think, keep on from swimming was good at our body.
So I will like it last [wd7,-] .
Morning excersises [fm1,-] [np4,2-1] match has been [vp6,5-1] on in our grade this Tuesday.
There are four classes in our grade.
Everybody was [wd3,2-5] hard to do it best.
It seemed that it was possibly [wd2,3-2] for us.
After the second lesson in the morning.We [fm3,-] ran to the playgroud [fm1,-] of our school at once that like 100 metre race.
 [sn,s] When the music began, we had already prepared [vp2,4-1] it [pr1,5-] .
in our class , we held our head high and stood at attention.
Soon after [wd4,2-] ,the match realy [fm1,-] began.
All of us do [vp6,4-2] it [pr1,1-] carefully.
During the match, we can [wd5,2-1] saw that the teachers who saw us nodded with smile.
I thought that we must do it perfectly.
After [wd4,1-1] match, [wd4,-4] head of our class paised [fm1,-] us for it.
Miss bai [fm3,-] was happy and satisfied for [vp2,2-1] it [pr1,3-] .
Sports are very useful and important for keep [vp4, 3-2] people's health.
So we must do with it like this match after it [pr1,5-] .
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the government.
There will be [vp6,3-2] the men from he [fm1,-] government should be [wd4, 2-2] Professor's office to take his papers to London.
 [sn,s] There is [vp6,2-6] half an hour to the time of they booked [wd7,5-] .
Two men came here.
They said they are [vp6,4-3] from the government, and they seemed to be too [wd3, 4-1] nervous and were too anxious to leave.
So the Professor give [vp6,3-1] them some papers from his books.
And the two men left.
It is [vp6,2-3] about eleven o'clock, the time of they are .
Two policemen came in.
They said that the men were impostors.
They kidnapped the right men from London and took away their cards, hen they've stolen [vp6,3-2] the invention.
 [wd4, 1-] professor smiled and said, the papers that [wd4,3-2] give vp6,4-1] them were wrong.
The papers of his invention were still in [wd3,8-2] his desk.
Finally, [wd4,-1] professor decided to take the papers to London himself.
My English was not well [wd2,5-] .
In fact, my pronunciation was not bad.
But it seems not to improve my English.
My English's [pr4,-] base [wd3,3-2] was bad.
I am used to [vp2,4-3] forget the words, and it is difficulty [wd2, 3-2] to grasp the grammer [fm1,-] and some of the idioms for me.
My English is too limited.
I never forced myself to learn it.
For example, Once, I kept up my mind [vp2,5-3] to read aloud the text every morning.
It took me about ten to fifteen munites [fm1,-] .
The first morning.
I was happily to do that.
This situation lasted seaval [fm1,-] days.
In [wd3,1-3] the fifth day , I felt that is [vp6,4-2] too much for me, So I didn't stick to it.
Before long, I forgot it.
Lazy [wd2,15-] is my the [wd5,1-] most [wd3,1-1] shortcoming.
I thought that [wd4,3-1] must be [wd5,1-] get rid of it.
otherwise, [fm3,-] it must [vp9,2-4] effect me very much.
My Winter Holiday [np6,3-] 
The winter holiday [np6,3-3] was very short.
It is [vp6,2-4] at least [wd3,-] two weeks.
Except [wd3,1-3] the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , it is [vp6,2-3] about seven days to study.
So it almost not a "holiday".
I know [vp6,2-] that is [vp6,2-3] the important time for us to study.
Teathers [fm1,-] often said that study n fact is [vp6,3-1] this.
In this holiday, I often remember [wd3,-] to go over my lessons.
Because I made up my mind to study hard this term.
I noticed everyone studies [vp6,4-2] very hard in the days before this holiday.
'Where, there is a will, there is a way.
' I said to myself many times.
But I found that is [vp6,2-4] the most important thing to do everything is [vp6,2-1] hard.
I was very lazy in my study.
So after the test, they could smiled [vp6,1-] aloud [cc5,4-] from their hearts.
Although I was [vp6,2-3] not very clever, I will go on to study hard in this term.
The Spring Festerval [fm1,-] 
At [wd3,1-2] the night before "The Spring Festerval [fm1,-] ",my perant [np6,2-] [fm1,-] ,and me walk [vp6,5-3] [wd3,5-3] "the flower street".
It is [vp6,2-3] near my home, then very *1/2?
for me.
At [wd3, 1-2] the street, There [fm3,-] are [vp6,2-4] many flowers in [wd5,1-1] it [wd5,1-] .
Some are [vp6,2-1] red, some are [vp6,2-1] yellow, some are [vp6,2-4] green and so on.
All sorts of them more beautiful than ever.
My family bought some flowers for our home.
Although the night was raining , [cc2,2-] people much more than before .
In [wd3,1-2] the Festerval [fm1,-] , I stayed at home almost every day.
Because the whether was very cold and I wanted to [wd4,3-2] in bed instead.
But I phone [wd5,2-1] call [vp6,2-2] my friends to say "Happy new [fm3,-] year [fm3,-] !
" to them.
At my home, it is [vp6,2-2] very warm, I was lazy to out .
Sometimes, my old school friends called [vp1,-] me, and said some beautiful words to me.
It is [vp6,2-4] much happier for me.
I wish all the people who I knew "Happy new [fm3,-] year [fm3,-] ".
Before the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , my friend do [vp6,3-1] [wd3,3-1] shopping with me.
In the street, we could see the people who looked excited.
Many flowers and oranges was [vp3, 57-] put at the gate of the shops.
It [pr1,1-3] looked beautiful.
In the shops, my friends and me wanted to buy something, but all the things [wd4,3-2] very expensive.
Some of the clothes very "in" and "?".
For the Spring Festerval [fm1,-] , we must buy some clothes or anything else.
At the end of the time [pp1,5-] , we bought much [wd3,3-1] something [wd3,-] to eat after [wd5,1-1] all [wd5,1-] .
We jumped, ran, smiled aloud [cc5,2-] in the street.
I seemed as if we had not seen anybody.
At the age of seventeen, it [wd5,1-4] is the beautiful [aj3,s-] age of [wd3,4-] every one.
We will remember this age at [wd3,1-2] our life.
I remembered the days that my old school friends had played at [wd3,1-2] the streets and roads with me liked at that time.
At the day [wd3,-] , we were all younger than today.
We were about six years old.
We smiled and smiled, all through everywhere that we had passed.
At the end of this holiday, tomorrow [wd7,-4] will go to school, the term will be begun [vp1,5-] .
At this [pr1,-] time, I feel excited and a little frightened.
Put the text books in my gands.
 [fm1,-] I read the words one by one.
It could make me happy.
I could [vp9,2-1] know that would be [wd5,3-3] become my knowledge.I read the texts louder [cc5,5-4] as nobody [wd4, 1-2] near me.
I was careful in it [pr1,5-] .
Sometimes, I turn on the radio and listen to the songs or the DJ's voice voice [wd5,1-] .
It can make me mopre [fm1,-] relaxing [aj4,4-] then ever.
I liked the songs which I felt beautiful,.
Wxpecially [fm1,-] the songs of [wd3,3-1] Englilsh [fm1,-] .
Altough [fm1,-] some of them I could not understand all about it.
I liked them which the music sounded well.
"Say you, say me","Right here waiting" "Unchained Melody" "Nothing's gonna change my love for you" "Casablance [fm1,-] " and so on.
In the years that followed I wish everyday [cc3,3-3] happier than ever.
With times [np5,2-2] go [vp4,3-1] by, our study has become [cc2,4-3] busier and busier.
All of the students [fm1,-] in our grade have studied [vp6,9-5] harder and harder than ever.
In [pp1,-] the lessons , we take an ative [fm1,-] [vp2,3-] in put [vp5,1-] up our hands to answer the questions.
Although we are very busy, we still care for our health.
After a [wd5,2-1] class, most of us will have a rest or go out of the classroom.
We don't stay in [wd4,1-1] classroom to read the textbook any more.
For being tired, how could we ?
After school, we come home later.
At home, Surely we go on with our study late into the night.
Our teachers and parents worry a bit for [wd3, 4-1] it [pr1,4-] .
It is important for us to listen carefully in the class.
If we could do it really [ad1,6-] , it is [vp6, 2-6] not too difficulty [wd2,1-] to study well.
Teachers often tell this to us.
We didn't used to believe it.
But [wd5,1-] when we do it for sometime, we could [vp9,2-4] find it was true.
my [fm3,-] friends, make [vp6,1-3] up our [np4,5-1] mind to study hard in these more than one year, and stick [vp6,1-3] to do this [pr1,4-] .Don't give up when our [pr1,-] fail.
We must believe that "Where, there is a will, there is way [np7,-] .
" and prove it.
After this Labour Day, we went to school again.
In the classroom, everyone looks [vp6,2-3] better then ever.
Perhaps, in the holiday, each of us paid attention to sleeping, food and so on.
So it can find [cc2,3-] that a [wd5,1-2] good sleep and good food was [vp6,6-6] important for men's health and works [np5,1-] .
It's being [vp6,2-1] fine today.
Then it makes our feeling not bad.In class, nobody notices some beautiful birds out of the windows not any longer.
On the contrary, we did our best to listen carefully that [wd5,-] what the teacher had said.
Teachers look [vp6,2-5] happy for we do this, and then made up their mind to make us study better then before.
English is an interesting thing [wd3,5-] .
I like it, but I always feel hard in it.
I think I must use my head [wd3,5-2] to think that [wd5,1-] what shall [wd1,1-2] I do and be good at it.
First, I must encourage myself and in front of the mirror [ad1,5-] to say to myself "Don't give up.
" every morning.
Our school is a key school.
It has a history of seventy years.
Many students who graduated in [wd3,3-2] our school became famous.

They are always trick [fm1,-] with us and we respect them.
There are less than a hard [wd7,2-1] month to [wd3,8-5] the graduation examine for us.
In our grade, most of the students study harder and harder, and the nearer [wd7,-] the harder.
Teachers and we [pr1,2-] devote ourselves to study.
Sometimes our teachers [wd4,3-3] eagerer [aj3,3-2] than us.
Somtimes [fm1,-] , we study hard to [wd3,4-2] the [wd5,1-1] midnight.
then [fm3,-] in [wd3,1-2] the day, we feel asleep [wd2,3-] .From then on , we study to night no longer.
At [wd3,1-1] class we rather listen carefully than study so tired [ad2,3-] .
At [wd3,1-1] class, students listen more careful [wd2,4-4] then any other time.
We wish to exam [wd2,-] well.

It [pr1,1-8] is [vp6,8-8] the reason that [pr5, 4-4] why I had filled.
The first was that I still didn't try my best to go over .
I was so lazy that I did less [aj3,7-11] exersices [fm1,-] for my study.
The other reason was that I cared less in my test.
Especially the [wd5,1-2] physics, though there were such single problems [np3, 5-2] , I had defeated [vp7,9-1] .
From the test, there is a lesson for me that I must study hard.
Saturday    Mar.15   Cloudy
Several days before [wd3,3-11] , I heard that there was a small bookshop nearby 6,8-2] my school.
l the books that is [vp6,5-7] [vp3,5-7] old were much cheaper than the others.
When I heard of this, I was so happy hat I nearly went to the bookshop at once.
Because some of the books which were sold outside do [vp6,10- 5] not fit us very well, some books which fit [vp6,20- 6] us but it sell [vp3,2-2] very spensive [fm1,-] .
So as a student, we are difficult aj1,6-7] to select and buy a good book.
For this, I can't miss the chance.
When the classes were over, I went to the bookshop at once.
But it is [vp6,2-7] too small for me to find out.
I was surprised when found the bookshop.
There were so many people in it and everyone put their heart into [vp2,12- 5] choosing books which they need [vp6,17- 1] .
In the end, I was so pleased that I bought some very [wd4,-] books which I need [vp6,13- 1] .

But now, I understand the word quite well.

For example, I like to watch TV, and listen to the popular music or go shopping.

Because there was no one to help him when he was in trouble.
He had a lot of friends, but none of them could understand him.
He had no true friends, so he had chosen the way to end his young life.
If you want to find true friends, at first we [pr1,9-8] must help others where they are in trouble and need you [pr4,13-1] help.
When you have true friend [np6,4-0] , then you know how beautiful friendship is!

On the contrary, it would be happier to me.
We all know, the teachers are badly in need of in our country, but not so many of us want to be a teacher.
The main reason of this is the work of the teachers is too hard and can't get so much.

One was English, the other was maths.
It's important for me to learn English and maths well, while the mark of English test was not bad for me.
I was very disappointed, because I spent three nights in going over the notes and texts.
Maybe I did the paper at a slow speed, I felt there wasn't enough time for me to do it.
Ever since then, I've learned I must do anything fast.

That must be interesting and instructive.
It was good for me to grasp [wd3,6-4] the life of farmer.

Dec 9th, 1995    Saturday
The things in is week were all common.
I had classes suffering because the blackboard reflected light, so that I couldn't look at the blackboard clearly.
I hoped Mr Zhu regulated [wd7,4-7] the seats as early as he could.
I had been in that place for [wd4,7-1] long tie [fm1,-] .
At the same time, I also hoped there were some window curtains on the southern windows.
I thought it was good for us to look at the blackboard and have classes well.
I was on duty yesterday.
When I swept the floor, I found there was much thick dust on the surface of the floor.
I wondered if the floor was swept the last days [pp1,2-] .
Didn't they want to have classes in a good environment?
And our class was also our family, we should keep it clean.
Dec 15th, 1995 Saturday    Cloudy
I would learn Lesson Seven, which named [vp4,1-3] "The Emperor's Clothes".
It was an interesting, instructive and famous story.
The story was: Once upon a time there lived an emperor who cared much for fine new clothes.
He changed different clothes each hour of the day.
One day two cheats who said that they could weave the most beautiful cloth in the world.
They told the emperor the clothes made of it [pr1,27-16] could not be see by the stupid or the men who ere [fm1,-] unfit for their work.
The emperor agreed to let hem make the invisible clothes in other [wd3,11-13] to find out which men in his empire was unfit for his offices.
The cheats were given some gold , beautiful silk and the best thread.
They pretended to weave cloth very hard.
During the days, the emperor asked some officials to go into the hall and see the new clothes.
But they all could see nothing.
Then they thought [wd4,3-7] were stupid or were unfit for their work.
They told the emperor the clothes was excellent in order to let him not [wd1,5-7] know they were unfit for their work.
Finally, the new clothes was "finished".
The emperor "saw" it and sing [vp3,3-] high praise for it.
In fact , he saw nothing.
How foolish the emperor was!
He believed he cheats at all [cc5,5-0] .
He "put" on the few clothes and walked down the road.

I took part [pp1,-] the matches of the art festival, which were to create the poems and songs and to read aloud the English.
I passed the matches after all.
Though I wrote the poems and songs and read aloud the English not very well.
I hoped I could gain the marks or my class.
In fact, marks were not important for me.
I believed the most important thing was to try bravely, to be a fearless fighter.
I ought to try to do more things in order to get along with everything.
Tomorrow will be Christmas [fm1,-] [fm3,-] .
I received many cards of christmas [fm1,-] [fm3,-] from my friends.

It was very hard to go over every subjects [np3,1-1] well.
The physics teacher told us that she had no time to help us go over the lesson.
Physics is the hardest for e to study.
I was afraid I would not pass the physics exam.
But I ought to get rid of the thinking, [wd4,-s] try my best to do best.

The emperor became angry though he felt very silly.
He ordered to stop the prossion [fm1, -] sudently [fm1,-] and cried loud, "Be quiet!
" The people topped crying and they began to be frightened with [pp1,5-2] the emperor.
The emperor said angrily "Yes, I was cheated by the cheats.
But why didn't you tell me early?
It proved all my officials were unfit for their work and they were not honest for [pp1,4-1] me".
Then he faced the officals [fm1,-] .
In fact, everyone laughed at the emperor by heart when they heard that, including the officials.
None of them said a word.
Of course the officals [fm1,-] didn't see the emperor with one eye .
At last, the child shouted, at the emperor "You don't like an emperor!
You just like a fool!
Ha..." Then most of the people took up his words and they also aid the emperor knew his [pr4,3-3] made a mistake, but he didn't accept [wd3,3-7] the mistake because he was an emperor, instead he wanted to drive off the people and the officals [fm1,-] .
He cried, " How dare you said [vp9,3-1] that!
Now, I order you, "Get out"!
Don't lived [vp9,1-3] in this empire!

Now I see, the life of school is instructive and happy actually.

I hoped every day could be like today.

One, two......None of them were ours.
To our surprise, the other three boats had reached the riverside, our oat hadn't gone through the bridge have yet.
A long time passed, our boat was driven towards the riverside.
Though we didn't win, we still felt glad and interesting.
The other students also rowed the boats, because we seldom sported on the river.
That was great!

I had learned [vp6,2-8] Lesson Thirteen, now let me retell the text.
One day Robinson Crusoe caught sight of the footprint of a man's [np4,4-3] in the sand while he was walking along the sands towards his boat.
The island was very silent [ad2,1-] , Crusoe wondered if there were some savages there, he looked round.
At last, he could see nothing at all.
He stared at the footprint, full of fear.
He hurried to step into his cave, and stayed there for some days.
He dare not go out and look for food.
But no savages came.
He decided to go out again after a time.
But just then his old ill dog which was his only friend died.
Crusoe felt very lonely.
He decided to go back and look [vp2, 6-10] the footmark again to prove if the footmark was his.
He found it wasn't his own.
There must be someone elso [fm1,-] on the island.
He was terried [fm1,-] at the result.
Crusoe at once did some measures.
He built another fence round his cave, made holes in the wall and placed his guns in them, pointing outwards.
But he still continued to look for a better hiding-place.
He found one in the rock, which was more than twelve feet high and had a narrow entrance.
He came into the cave, when he suddenly saw two yes glaring at him out of the darkness, he ran away into the daylight quickly.
After a time, he held a lighted stick to step into the dark cave again.
It was the goat's eyes that he had seen.
The goat rolled over and died immediately.
Crusoe was satisfied with the high dry hiding-place.
He placed five guns and much gun-powder there, and made some candles to give light.
So he lived on the island for months and years.
Every day he climbed to a high rock to keep watch.
One morning of autumn, he saw nine savages which were sitting round a fire and eating something were [vp4,17-3] one the shore.
Crusoe was full of fear again.
As soon as the savages had gone.
Crusoe made his way down to the shore with two guns to have a look.
He went towards the fire, he found the bones of a human being among the ashes!
Crusoe made up mind [wd4,1-] to shoot the savages if they came again, because they killed their enemies and ate them.
But ever since then, no one arrived at the island.

I didn't want to go out, but this evening many people would come to my home to have dinner, I had to help my mother buy something.
So in the afternoon I took a [np7,2-1] umbrella and wore a pair of rain-boots to go downstairs.
I had thought that there must be few people in the street.
Though the rain continued dropping [vp4,-] , the floor was very wet, many people still went out from home with great joy.
That seemed a warm air in the cold weather.
I could feel warm in my whole body.
I reached a food-shop, there stood many people, as a kind of food was very popular [fm1,-] , I had to buy it in line.
I hoped it would be fine tomorrow after all.
This week in our class two young women came, who are they?
They are new head teachers , they are from Hua lan [fm2,-] School.
They will try to be a good teacher more than six weeks.
Our Chinese will be insteaded [fm1,-] by them .
To my joy, I should get to know two friends.
How they introduced themself [fm2,-] to us is very interesting.
One of them said [wd3,3-2] her name, then told us her telephone umber, [wd4,14-15] asked us to plone [fm1,-] her, so that we could talk about what we want to speak [wd3,10-0] .
This made us very surprise and happy.
I think two new teachers aren't much older than us.
They must have many ideas and good [cc4,6-1] knowledge.
We will study [wd3,2-6] a lot of things from them.
I really welcome [wd4,3-2] two new teacher [np6,2-0] .
This is the Mid-Autumn Day.
It is a remarkable day.
people [fm3,-] said tonight's moon was very much.
Why the moon was around has a fairy tales .
The fairy tals [fm1,-] is [vp3,5-2] very interesting, old man, young man, child all know this.
Eating moon cake looking [wd4, 3-4] [vp2,3-2] the moon, all this [pr3,11-4] are done every year.
Children are very happy, they take light cage [np6,3-7] [wd3,3-5] to walk around the street, they sing and laught [fm1,-] .
Some people are happy, but some people are unhappy.
I am ones, because I have so many [np8,1-3] many home work [fm2,-] to do.
I have no time to play.
Ever my father asked me to travll [fm1,-] to some place, but I refused.
I want to go [vp2,3-2] to outside, too.
only [fm3,-] thinking [vp2,3-2] the study, I am obliged to think over [wd4,5-0] .It is go to college that I wish to .
Next weak [fm1,-] , our school is to hold the school sport meeting.
It will be time to ... for own class .
Our class has [vp1,-] many boys, a few girls.
Then, all the boys take an active part in this sport meeting.
I also want to take part in.
but I regret I couldn't take part in.
because [fm3,-] of running not fast, throwing not far.
Jumping not hight [fm1,-] .My neigh [cc4,-] classmate, he [fm3,-] Fu zhi took park [wd3,7-8] in running [wd5,13-6] one thousand five hundred metres' [np4,20-1] running.
When I heart [fm2,-] , I looked at him in surprise and dumbfound .Is he able to run so long?
I don't blive [fm1,-] at all.
But he has the courage.
This is very good.
I congratnlation [fm1,-] that everyone taking part in of our class will win.
The No.4 Middle school held the sport [np6,-] meeting last week.
This [fm3,-] meeting separated [vp7,4-2] two times [wd7,6-0] , one [fm3,-] was in [wd3,0-2] firday [fm3,-] afternoon, other was in [wd3,0-2] Saturday morning.
It keep [vp1, 1-6] [vp6,1-4] on a long time.
That day the beginning is [vp6, 4-1] grand.
Six student [np6,1-0] help up our national flay [fm1,-] with five yellow stars pass [vp4,15-2] by the ... when [fm3,-] the hand [wd3,1-1] master declared the sport meeting begining [fm2,-] [vp5,9-0] ,every class pick [vp6,17-3] out some student stood [vp4,8-2] in line, walking the sport- spot, we deely [fm1,-] moved [vp7,2-0] .
Everywhere we can find the [wd5,4-1] laughing.
I paid attention to every-place [fm2,-] .
I was interesting [aj4,2-2] in runing [fm2,-] .
All the students ran very fast.
Something else is [vp6,8-2] also interesting.
The students who took part in [wd4,5-6] were very friendly to each other.
I will remember this sports meeting for ever.
This week we have learned Lesson Five-winter [fm3,-] sleep [fm3,-] .
It induced [wd3,1-7] some animal how to spent [vp5,4-2] the winter.
I have known [cc3,2-9] a great of knowledge about these from the lesson.
we [fm3,-] all know the cold blooded animal must hibernate in winter, but do you know some animal [np6,5-0] need to sleep in summer.
You should be surprised for what's summer sleep.
I have ever read a book about the summer sleep.
Let me tell you.
Because the weather in summer is too hot for some animals to live.
If they movement [wd2,-] all day, they will lose water and be very tried [fm1,-] , until they die from hotten [fm1,-] .
For this they had to sleep, but their sleep's [np4, 2-5] time is shorter than hibernation.
They only sleep two or three weeks then they wake up to find food and water.
I have to go to school for six days in this term.
Then I stay at home for only one day.
it is Sunday [fm3,-] .
How do I spend the Sunday?
Let me tell you.
In the morning I get up later than usual.
I don't get up until eight o'clock.
After I have breakfast, I would go over texs [fm1,-] , till half past ten, and then I watch TV.
In a week I hardly have time to wathc [fm1,-] TV.
Because home words [cc1,2-3] are too many.
In the afternoon I sleep a long time.
At four o'clock, I will see football match in [wd3,5-1] TV.
In the night I will go over [wd4,6-1] , too.
next [fm3,-] I go to bed.
I didn't like to go out to play.
Sometimes I go to library [np6,4-4] and borrow some books.
My Sunday is [wd4,2-1] that .
We had a lesson of English on Friday afternoon.
In the floor [cc1,2-2] meeting room.
It was a young man with glasses that spoke to us.
As a speaker he taught us how to study English very well.
he [fm3,-] spoke wonderful [ad2,4-0] and make me deep feel [cc5,3-4] English is very nessecry [fm1,-] .
What he said" I enjoy Losing Face," let me know English more than before.
I decied [fm1,-] to learn English harder after I heard [wd3,-] this lesson.
I think the note Book of Lesson .
I think the Note Book of Lesson One " How Karl Marx learn English.
" And "How Li Yan learn English:" are different in way [wd7,3-0] .
I received the back [wd3,3-1] one [pr1,6-0] , because I think it will fit me.
New ways are better than old ways.
I think I will beat [cc3,4-3] English before long.
We visited the Xi Zhao Hill last Saturday.
We got to Xi Zhao Hill by bus, having two half hours [cc4,-] ride.
The Xi Zhao Hill is much larger and highter [fm1,-] than any other hill in Guang zhou [fm1,-] .
That day I had a good time.
I saw many things which I hadn't seen before.
There are a lot of fairy tales in differently .
The Hill is so beautiful that it leads to bring many people's comeing [fm1,-] , for example: students, peasants, workers, the [wd5,7-2] foreign friends.
But everywhere monry [fm1,-] is the most necessary.
People there want many monry [fm1,-] very much.
If you reach same place, you must play [cc3,2-4] some monry [fm1,-] for visiting, " No monny [fm1,-] No talk" This word is fit for the Hill .
If you visit our school, the No.
4 Middle school now, you must feel very surprise [wd2,4-0] .
Because you can't see the old school, which you have even [wd3,10-1] seen.
Now our school is changing.
Mony [fm1,-] builting [fm1,-] have been knocked down.
The workers are hard [ad1,3-1] builting [fm1,-] .
All the students try own's [vp2,4-3] best to help.
They give a great deal of good idea [np1,5-0] [np6,7-0] in order to make the school more beautiful.
The work of rebuilting [fm1,-] the school is all the students and teachers' wish.
We hope all of us could live in a quite beautiful great space to earn [cc3,0-1] knowledge.
I think when the school finishs [fm2,-] rebutlling [fm1,-] , I have [vp6,12-2] left here.
I can't see the new school.
But I don't regrad [fm1,-] .
I will try my best to do with the work.
The school will be much beautiful before long.
That day isn't very long [wd3,12-0] .
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning..... And he was going to give his invention to all over [wd5,10-2] the world, because of loving all human [np6,4-0] .
He would give his invention without [wd3,5-1] nothing.
Two men who were cheats, came to the [wd5,7-7] Hunter's home and asked for the inventio [fm1,-] .But Hunter was very clever and careful in his invention.
He found that [wd4,-] two men weren't like the right men.
Then he gave the other papers to [wd4,7-1] two men.
Later Inspector White Sergeane [fm1,-] Bull and Miss Green beleived [fm1,-] the papers had Been [fm3,-] rodded [fm1,-] by [wd4,15-1] two men, they worried about that.
So Hunter Professor [cc1,1-] told them, the papers of this invention were in his hand.
He already have [vp3,2-1] understood what's happen [vp6,7-0] .
He would take the papers to London himself.
The weather turns colder and colder.
The wind blows heavly [fm1,-] .
Many people don't want to get up early in the morning.
They stay in bed and feel warmer than out of bed.
It doesn't [cc3,1-3] a good thing.
Today I learned the nineth [fm1,-] Lesson --- sports and games [fm3,-] .
It says sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work with brains most of the day, and then sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy, they are also very useful for character-training.
We can think how necessary sports and games [wd4,7-0] .
We must do more sports, then build our bodies, that we would work harder, love of our's [pr4,-] county to try our best to make it beautiful and strong .
In [wd5,0-2] this week, many pople [fm1,-] doesn't be happy.
Because the Chinese football term [fm1,-] wasn't won [vp1,8-0] in the football match.
China is a larger country, then there are many people.
Most of them all love football very much.
Everyone hope [vp3,1-0] China [np4,4-6] football term [wd3, 8-6] win [vp3,9-3] in each match.
But things doesn't [vp3, 4] decide for people want .
Our football term [wd3, 2-0] is weak.
I think I can't throw much more wish [cc3,7-3] in football term [wd3,2-0] .
In my studies, there are eight subjues [fm1,-] which have to learn [vp7,7-0] .
There are China [wd3,2-2] , Match [wd3,5-0] , English, physics, chemise [fm1,-] , Histray [fm1,-] ....
I like history best of all these.
Our teacher who teach [vp3,3-2] us history s a men [np3,10-2] of porties [fm1,-] .
He talk [vp3,1-0] very well.
His knowleage [fm1,-] is like a ea [fm1,-] .
I look on him as a good teacher.
He taught us nearly [wd4,3-2] one ear.
I have learned many [cc4,3-1] knowlege [cc3,4-0] about China or world [np6,3-0] .I depended on myself to learn history [wd4,7-0] ago and I didn't hear [cc3,2-2] teacher's lesson.
But now I pay attionsion [fm1,-] to teacher's lesson.
I would put [vp2,2-5] my heart into the lesson.
If you visit our school, the No.4 Middle school you must feel very surprise [wd2,4-0] .
Because you can't see the old school, which you have even seen.
Now our school is changing.
Many builting [fm1,-] have been knocked down.
The workers are bjuilting [fm1,-] .
All the students try own's best to help.
They give a great deal of good idea [np3,7-0] , in order to make the school more beautiful.
The work of rebuilting [fm1,-] the school is all the students and teachers' wish.
We hope all of us could live in a quite [fm1,-] , beautiful, great space to learn knowledge.
I think when the school finishs [fm1,-] rebuiding.
I have eft [vp6,11-1] here.
The school will be much beautiful before long.
That day sn't very long [wd3,4-0] .
The winter holiday was short.
It was only two weeks.
Many homeword [fm1,-] would be done.
I borrowed a lot of books for [wd3,6-1] laberition [fm1,-] .
I read them very carefully, and that I knew what the world is.
Every several days I will go out to play football and basketball with my good friends.
Through the playing, I made quite a few and [wd5,5-2] new friends.
Only in the playing lace, I eel happy yet [wd5,8-0] .
Before we can't [wd3,2-4] [vp6,2-0] be allowed to play football or basketball in school, somebody said that Hay [fm1,-] sth [fm1,-] in school will harm sb [fm1,-] or sth [fm1,-] .
Now I can play long.
In the winter holiday I do [vp6,5-3] all the housework, because my mother and father had to go to work, so [wd5,21-3] I do [vp6,14-1] everything.
Doing good housework is not easy.
I feel [vp6,36-2] very tired.
I try [vp6,42-5] my best to do that.
In the two weeks, I think [vp6, 5-0] a lot of thing [np3,3-0] , which I have [vp6,16-2] to [wd4,6-0] with.
The Spring Holiday, which one year is one time, is 1997 this year .
In this year, there is a great thing that Hang Kang will be returned to our country.
Everyone feel [vp6,1-3] happy with it.
because [fm3,-] of the reason, this spring holiday is very pleasant.
I have eaten a lot of food on [wd3,7-2] several days.
Eating too much will make sb [fm1,-] become fat.
I am afraid I would turn [vp2,2-3] a fat boy.
But the food are [vp3,3-2] very good.
I don't know how to do.
In this year, the goverment [fm1,-] in guang zhou [fm3,-] [fm3,-] don't [vp3, 14-7] allow the people to play a game.
The game is playing fire [vp2,4-0] .I think it was a [np7,4-2] interesting game.
The children play them with pleasnet [fm1,-] .
But the game is a little dange [fm1,-] .This year [np1,1-8] of the Spring holiday is like last year's, there are no new things.
All the people go there and go here all the day except the people whose leg can't walk [cc2,3-0] .
I didn't buy some [pr6,-] new clothes or shoes.
I care a little interest in it .
this [fm3,-] year is cow .
I don't like this animal.
I feel unluck [fm1,-] now.
My famil [fm1,-] will move in the Match [fm1,-] .
Now my home which I live [vp2,5-2] is big, through [fm1,-] it isn't great, it is big.
I have a room for [wd4,5-0] own.
I can do everything I like in it.
The place where we live is old, it isn't tall.
It well be rebuilt and built tall thing .
I don't we would move to where yet till now .
I am afraid the place where we move [vp2,7-9] is very far from my No.
4 Middle school.
Oh, if the place is farer [aj3,3-2] than there.
Such will make me very tired.
I want to cry.
I don't hope that I change the place.
The weather turns colder and colder, the wind blows heavly [fm1,-] .
Many people don't want to get up early in the morning.
They stay in bed and feel warmer than our [fm1,-] of bed.
It isn't a good thing.
I learned the Nineth [fm1,-] Lesson--sports and game.
It says sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work with their brains most of the day, and then sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy, they are also very useful for charcter [fm1,-] tranining [fm1,-] .
We can think how necessary sports and games [wd4,7-0] .
A bad news came from Beijing in February 1997.
Our the [wd5, 1-2] greatest Leader, comrade Dun Xi Ping is dead.
He left among [wd5,2-3] us for ever.
All the country is in sad feeling.
Every one [fm1,-] can't help holding [cc3,6-1] tears, for the great man's death.
His name, which nobody don't [vp3,4-1] know will stay at [pp1,10-2] our heart, comrade Don Xi Ping have put his life the throw into revolutionary affairs since he joined the Chinese Party.
He loved all the people of China deeply.
All the people of China love him deeply too.
I am a student.
I decide to try my best to study.
Comrade Don Xi Ping hoped that he could see Hong Gong [fm1,-] would return to our country till [wd5,5-2] one day.
but [fm3,-] he couldn't see with his own eyes.
I think he regreted [fm1,-] very much.
Our country is getting stronger and stronger, the people are getting richer and richer.
We can't forget comrade Don Xi Ping.
It was he who leads [vp6,11-7] us to go to the new tomorrow.
We will miss the great men [np3, 5-8] for ever.
He is living in our heart.
If you visit our school, the No.4 Middle school you must feel very surprised.
Because you can't see the old school, which you have even seen.
Now our school is changing.
Many builting [fm1,-] have been knocked down.
The worker are [vp3, 2-1] building [vp1,5-0] .
All the students try their best to help.
They give a great deal of good idea [np6,7-0] , in order to make the school more beautiful.
The work of rebuilting [fm1,-] the school is all the students and teachers' wish.
We hope all of us could live in a quite, beautiful, great space to learn [vp1,16-0] .
The weather is quite bad in several weeks.
It rains all day and all night.
Looking at the sky, the sky is not blue, it is deeply dark.
The groud [fm1-] is wet.
Nobody like [vp3, 1-1] this.
That weather bring [vp3,2-3] trouble to people.
The drivers cannot drive much fastet [fm1,-] than before, if he does so, he must be regreting [fm1,-] .
People [wd4,1-6] rather stay at home than go out, because of heavy rain.
The old man must be taken good care of.
They [pr3,9-5] couldn't use [vp2, 4-3] to the weather, the children also must be looked after well.
they'd [fm3,-] better wear enough clothes to keep the cold out, maybe [wd3,-] they would become ill.
It isn't a good thing.
Expect the weather to turn good.
our [fm3,-] school is being rebuilt.
Look, there are two new basketball-port [fm1,-] .
Before that, our school has not got basketball port [fm1,-] .
Basketball is a wild interesting game whose game the people all the country especially the young man, love very much.
In fact, basketball is a good fun, it can make people strong, bring a good time to people.
The human [wd3,1-5] who had invented this game is a great man.
My classmat [fm1,-] and I also like basketball.
They play well and often hold the match.
Now we may play basketball at new basketball- port [fm1,-] .
Last week, the school leader care [vp3,5-4] more for our class.
They sent a new teacher to us.
The new teacher names [vp1,3-1] E. she [fm3,-] ever taught us health- lesson.
She is young, we often see her smile on her face.I found she really [wd4,3-3] a good teacher.
In the morning, she came in our classroom early in order to examin [fm1,-] our morning reading.
She alway [fm1,-] says the morning reading is quite important for us to remember the knowledge, we can learn new knowleage [fm1,-] from it, and he is very kind to us.
She is more a good friend than a good teacher.
This sundy [fm1,-] , it isn't a good day because of little rain.
My family came to the memorion [fm1,-] .
There are more people than last year.
But it is not dirty [aj3,4-3] than last year.
The government has ordered not to allow [wd5,6-3] to burn something [wd3,21-0] .
If all the people who came [vp6,-] there do [vp5,9-1] this, the air will be made very dirty by them.
Something are burned, they give off poisonous gases.
All poisonous gases is [vp3,3-3] harmful for people.
The government's order is praised.
The people hope like this .
Our school held the match of the ten-singer.
This is a good idea.
Many students, who want show their singing take an active part in [vp2,11-0] .
there [fm3,-] are four students in my classroom [wd3,8-0] , they take part in this match.
They all [ad1,1-8] are sure that they could win the match.
At last, only one of them get in the last match.
It is Xu Wei feng who goes [vp1,6-3] on the match.
Nobody could think he would win the match.
But to our surprise, he won.
Leager [fm2,-] mumbers [fm1,-] held a meeting.
The subject is about Hong Gang [fm1,-] recoming [fm2,-] .
They adviced us to write our own name into a piece of long cloth.
All the students take an active part in this.
The leager [fm2,-] mumbers [fm1,-] of every class made [vp6,15-7] a wonderful goods [np1,2-4] post to Hong Cang [fm1,-] .
This prove [vp6,1-1] that all the students of the No.
4 Middle school [fm3,-] take good care for [vp2,3-3] Hong Gong recoming [fm2,-] .
We look forward to the day, 7,1 coming earlyer [fm1,-] .
Our country will become stronger and stronger.
I visited the Tong de Garden with my good friends last week.
though [fm3,-] this place is far enough from Guangzhou.
It took us half an hours [np6,5-0] to got [vp5,1-0] there.
It is wide and great.
I think the Tong De Garden is one of the beautiful places.
Many building [np3,1-0] is modern.
In [pp1,-6] the both side all kinds of trees and flowers are planted.
The people who live there must be very happy.
There have [vp2,1-6] some spots for people having sports.
It is really a good place.
If someone asks you: " what is more important Chinese or English?
" I will answer it is Chinese that is more important than English.
Chinese is not only our native language, but also a base of learning the other subjects well.
Chinese and English both are difficult to study well, but we make progress more rapid in English than Chinese.
So some people would think English is important.
When we study English, we have to translate it into Chinese.
That inproves [fm1,-] Chinese is more important than English.
My new school.
Our No.4 middle school [fm3,-] is really a key school, as we all know.
Our school has a history of sevetty [fm1,-] years.
Our school have [vp3,2-9] been rebuilt more and more beautiful since it formed.
Now there are thirty six classes in our school, and one thousand eight handred [fm1,-] students and more than two hundred teachers.
We are united and friendly.
We love our school because it is big and wonderful, around the schoolrooms stand all kinds of trees.
The teachers are good, they are strike [fm1,-] with students.
students [fm3,-] inspect [wd3,1-1] teachers.
People include [vp4,1-20] the old, the young, the men and the women, are interested in taking an active part in sports and games.
Sports and games are becoming more and more popular in the world.
Because they are of great value.
They could build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat and keep us healthy.
In our country, a plan is being carried out.
The plan named [vp1, 2-11] " All people in China must practive [fm1,-] for their body.
" This plan is welcome.
Sports and games are also useful for character training.
It is hard to say this because my English is very limited.
But sports and game really is [vp3,5-4] more important than others.
Day: Saturday Date: June.
14.
Weather: very hot (30) Today it is a hot day.
At [pp1,2-0] the afternoon the tempeiture [fm1,-] move [wd3,9-4] to about thirty centigrade.
On my way home, I saw sever [fm1,-] or eight children swimming.
They are like fish, and have a good time.
A little girl is learning swimming, the teacher who teaches her is her mother.
When I was a child, I often went to swim.
I remember that time when I sawm [fm1,-] in [pp1,7-7] the end was about ten years ago.
Then I had a holiday in Beijing.
I think that June is [vp6,28-8] one of the best months in a year.
The New School Term.
Now it's September [fm3,-] , the new school term has begun for a few days.
We begin to study the new knowledge.
Last week, we studied a new text--- HOW MARX LEARNED FOREIGN LANGUAGES.
This lesson tell [vp3,2-3] us many ways to study English.
For example: when a person is learnign [fm1,-] a foreign language, he must not always be translating everything into his own language.
If he does this, it shows he has not mastered it.
Now we have just gone into the senior middle school, study [fm3,-] English is felt a bit difficult, but I will keep on studying hard and often ask the teacher [wd4,3-1] some advice on how to study English.
At home, I will do [cc3,2-5] some progress in some time.
My teacher, you say all right?
I'm going to do my best to study English.
The next day is National Day.
And Oct. 1, 2 [wd5,3-4] , is the public's holiday.
We are all at home go [vp4,5-3] over the homework.
In the next week, we will have the test, so we should go over carefully.
after [fm3,-] the new school term begin, we studys [fm1,-] [cc3,1-3] many new knowledge.
The [wd5,0-4] Unit1 has been finished.
I feel the senior middle school's knowledge is difficult than before.
So I must try my best to study hard.
I should try my best to go over it.
In [wd3,0-2] National Day, I'm going to go [wd5,3-2] to travel, but the weather rains [cc2,3-0] .
I only stay at home.
Pases [fm1,-] going over the lesson, I hope to have the test get good mark .
My School.

It is not very big but it has more forty's [wd7,-1] history.
My school is beautiful, but now it is putting [vp2,8-1] on.

But sometimes I also watched TV because I felt studying lessons shouldn't too tired.
After some times [np5,2-5] you should have a rest, or you went over too much in a short time.
You would be difficult [aj1,3-3] to remember it.

Time is very valuable.
Time past quickly.
We will have exams in about one and a half months.
We should make full use of time to study hard.
Because time is very valuable.
The time everybody has is limited.
But why some people could do more work in limited time, and someone couldn't?
because [fm3,-] they dealt [vp2,2-4] the time was different, some people made [vp2,2-3] full use time to study [vp1,1-2] on work, and someone spent the time in chatting, gambling or playing.
They didn't realize that they were wasting their life.

A Diligent Boy.
This was a story once upon a time there lived a boy.
He was fond of reading books.
But he was poor so that he had no money to buy any books.
So he had to walk a long roads [np3,1-] to borrow books from a rich man.
Because he always returned the books on time, the rich man was ready to lend books to him.
The boy read a lot of books in this way.
At last, he became one of the famous writers.
But the rich man's son had only little knowledge.
Jun 14.
It is about at thirty centigrade.
I see eight children swim in the river, and they are almost good at swimming.
One girl is learning swimming with her mother.
I often swim during my childhood.
I have swimming at last in time of having a holiday in Beijing about ten years ago .
I think Jun [fm1,-] is one of the best seasons in a year.It is time to have a composition class.
After the bell rang, the students took their place [np3,4-0] , waiting for the teacher.
But several seconds later, the teacher didn't come.
At the time, some students began to talk [vp1,4-2] each other, some ones [wd5,10-5] read other books, others made noises.
Twenty seconds passed, the teacher entered the classroom, but she didn't make a [np7,4-1] apology.
She picked up a piece of chalk, writing on the blackbroad [fm1,-] "Teacher is late".
Then she turned back to us and said: this is the topic for this composition.

Roads always full [wd2,2-2] of cars such as [pr1,8-2] Thailand's Bangkok.
Old Guangzhou is [vp2,2-2] like that too.
Now the main Roads of new Guangzhou is enough [ad2,1-1] wide for the cars to run fast.
It [pr2,0-4] must thank the government for its working.
STATVE [fm1,-] OF LIBERTY
One of the most famous monuments in the world is the Statue of Liberty.
It was [vp2,6-2] the present that the people of France sent to America in the nineteenth century.
It was [vp2,24-3] made of copper and it was [vp2,32-3] 150 feet tall.
Since it was set up, it became [vp2,6-2] a symbol of liberty for the people of America.
Today Is Too Bad Today morning [np1,1-0] , when it was blur, I went to visit a friend.
When we were talking .

Oh, no, I have [vp2,15-2] no umbrella.

This is a good matter [cc1,4-0] to [pp1,7-2] the develop [fm2,-] of the world's science ad [fm1,-] to [pp1,19-2] the player of computer.
 [fm2,-] Now the factory of CPU had three: Intel, Cyrix and AMD.
Intel is the biggest maker of CPU.
Cyrix or AMD are the promising youth.
In some field, [fm2,-] Cyrix ar [fm1,-] AMD's technology of CPU's [np4,2-1] produce [vp5,3-0] even over vp1,14-3] that of Intel.
Because the competition of [wd3,-] them is very keen, the price of the CPU falls down very quickly.
Even every other month, it will fall scores of dollars.
But that is a good information for us, that means we can buy an advanced computer with less money.
The Worst Holiday
There were [cc3,1-1] holidays in this National Day.
Those should [vp6,1-1] be the universal rejoicing days.
At first, I was so happy when I heard this news, because I could have a rest in those days.
But, when I came to know that there were three subjects would have a test as soon as the holidays went out. [cc2,1-1] .
That meant I would not be able to sleep till the lunch.
I felt my wish was broken.
At last, in the four days, I studied as if I was in school.
I was sure this was the worst holiday from the day I was born.

Reading this, I comprehended something and I felt quiet ashamed that I had had no physical training for more than one year outside the physical cuiture [fm1,-] class.
Every time when I wanted to have a physical training, I always made a pretext to avoid it.
This was a bad habid, [fm1,-] and I wanted to correct it [cc3,12-2] from today.
So, I held my barbell [fm1,-] at once that had been [vp6,10-3] covered with dust and raised it....
The Practice [cc1,-2] Chinese Teacher
Three weeks ago, two practice Chinese teachers came to my class and began to teacher [wd2,-] .
They would taught us Unit 1 and Unit 2.
At first, I wondered if they could teach us good as if the official Chinese teacher, for, being so young and shout [fm1,-] of experience.
But , after they had had some lesson for us, I changed my idea.
They taught well, that was a truth.
They were consicientious [fm1,-] in their practice [wd2,1-1] work.
They corrected our exercises in a careful and thoroughgoing way.
This could be seen from the remarks on our excises books.
They were fit for their job.
They were so good.

Although every landscape have [vp6,11-2] good names, but it always bring vp6,19-2] us disappointment.
A part [cc1,0-2] of people only layed [fm2,-] cards all through the three hours.
I think the most intent [wd7,2-1] thing I did is I left my foot mark on the hill.
For The Coming Success
The terminal examination had concluded for two weeks.
I failed in this examination.
But the unfeeling [wd7,1-1] fact would not make me downhearted.
I looked for the reason that I failed and I found the most important reason was that I had few pressing [wd7,0-1] feeling.
But, now, the feeling is so string.
 [fm1,-] It makes me think out al [fm1,-] kinds of ways to improve the study ways [wd3,1-0] and to arranged [vp5,1-0] the study time more reasonable [wd2, 7-0] .
My motto of today is "All the work today [np1,2-0] is finished [vp6,7-2] within today".
It includes reviewing all the subject today and solving all the question [np6,2-2] about them.I expect the success.

Then the government sent two men to the professor's house for the papers.
But on the way to Dr Hunter's house, they were seized and shut in a house by another two men.
These two came to Dr Hunter's house and asked for the papers.
However, they were too nervous and too anxious to go away.
This was noticed by Dr Hunter, so, the professor gave the impostors some other papers.
They accepted it and soon go [vp6, 5-1] away.
At last, Miss Green, Dr. Hunter's secretary, received the police's phone call about the true [wd2,4-0] , and she told Dr Hunter sadly.

In the world, there're only four countries that can produce films.
They're China, America, Japan, and Germany.
The film factory in China calls [vp7,3-1] Lekai.
A [np8,0-2] Lekai [fm2,-] film is sold [vp1,3-4] only about ten yuan, This makes the foreign films have to be sold in [wd3,0-3] a low price.
In other countries which have no film factory [fm2,-] of their own.Such as in Russia, a [np7,0-1] imported film is sold in [wd3,3-3] about fifteen dollar.
Would the ported films be sold still [ad1,2-4] in a low price, if China lost Lekai [fm2,-] ?
I'm afraid not.
The Winter Holiday
Though we had known [vp6,1-8] that this Winter Holiday could be very short and we would have to make up lessons in it, I had hoped the teachers would give us few homeworks [np5,1-] , then, I could have a good rest to meet the new term.
But all the hopes were broken.
Every teacher but Mr Zeng gave us a lot of homeworks [np6,3-0] .
Oh, my god, [fm3,-] there were only thirteen free days.
In these days, I could have to pay some New Years [np4,2-1] calls [wd3,4-3] to my relatives with my parents , have to finish the exercised [wd2,2-0] .
What a Holiday [fm3,-] !
The Happy Night
On February 6, my parents and I went to the Flower Fair which was in the Yuexiu region.
Although at the night it was raining and sometimes it rained fairly hard, there were so many visitor visiting the Flower Fair.
This surprised us.I thought it was because this year was the Bull Year.
They wanted to devoloped [wd7,0-3] the Bull's vigour: dare not to do the tired things.
Proping up [wd3,1-1] umbrellas, we alked about the busy Flower Fair and the beautiful flowers excited.
The bad weather didn't make us dissappointed [fm1,-] , instead we had a good time at that night.
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival is the Festival of Chinese.
It includes three days.
In these days, the people all over the country are in happiness.
To the children, the Spring Festival means they can wear the [np7,10-2] new clothers [fm1,-] , get the "Lishe".
It's time for them to havest [fm1,-] .
To the adult, the Spring Festival is the busy day [np6,6-0] .
They will go to pay New Year calls to their relatives from this house to that house.
To most people , they will play deep [wd3,1-3] into the night, get up later [aj3,2-3] in next morning.
In a word, the Spring Festival is the day which is full of happy atmosphere.
The Trouble Day
Maybe it knew that we would go to visit our old Classmaster [fm1,-] , it stopped raining at AM 9:00 [wd1,1-] At 10:00.All the friend [fm2,-] had been [np1,6-3] the assembly point, but one, At last, we knew from the phone call that he had forgotten it.
Then Eighteen people set out.
After we leave [vp6,16-3] the teacher's home at 12:30.
We quarrelled about the place where we would [vp9,6-2] have lunch.
At the fast food restaurant we would have lunch [wd1,7-0] .At the fast food restaurant, we threw the ice which in the soft drink to other [pr3,10-1] friends.
When we were happy, it rained again.
We had to rush to a friend's house near here.
But we lost the way in the path.
Oh, the trouble day, why I met it?
The New Beginning
The new term had [vp6,3-6] been on Formally for two weeks.
All customs that in last term Had [vp6,20-2] been restored.
We had [vp6,26-6] to go to school at night again.
Besides this,, we had [vp6,39-4] to go to school at night again.
Besides this, we had [vp6,52-15] to go to school to read aloud the text [wd1,3-0] at AM 7 :30 [wd1, 2-0] , and we had [vp6,74-12] to write the old [cc4,0-1] words from vp2,6-1] memory everyday.
Although we didn't [vp6,91-5] want to do those things, they were [vp6,100-11] the only way to get [vp2,0-2] the [np7,0-1] success in our learning.
There are some good news, too.
Such as the new basket-ball ground will be finished building [wd5,2-0] soon.
There are some new challenges, too, such as the coming examination in our province.
We are getting ready for the new challenges.
Two People Two Result At this weekend, we will have a maths test.
We all were [vp6,8-8] busy doing the maths excises day and night.
This night, Guozongci asked me a question.
When I saw t, I said it was easy, and I had done it.
Then I did t again for him.
Soon, I had some trouble.
I found I couldn't explain it.
How I explained it yesterday?
I thought it over.
At last, I found the rror [fm1,-] is in the printing.
It caped [wd3,1-3] the letter "I".
When I told his [pr4,2-2] this result, he opened his mouth, last [vp4,4-2] fifteen seconds.
Then, he said in a very dejected voice: "I have spent so much time on it.
I had believes [vp6,1-0] that it was a very hard question which few people could work out.
But , now ...... " I thought I was lucky, because , when I work it yesterday.
My eyes were so tired that I believed the question had the latter "I" by mistake.
Otherwise, I would work [vp6,19-3] it [vp1,3-0] like Cuozongci.
The Busy Sunday
This Saturday, there came a bad news that we would had to [vp4,2-2] write composition.
The composition was about how to protect the environment and it must be completed before next Wednesday.
That meant we would have to finish it on Sunday, or we would have no time to do it next week.
But, besides his, I had to do the chemical exercises which had eleven pages, had to do the English exercises which has [vp6,7-2] twelve pages, had to go over the English lessons, had to go over the political lessons for he coming examination on next Tuesday.
Oh, the busy Sunday!
I can't finish all the work.
The New Basket-ball Court.
Since [wd3,0-2] this week, our new basket-ball courts [np6,12-0] had entered the last constructional stage.
They [pr1,21-0] would [vp6,0-5] be finished in two weeks.
That's great.
We could [vp6,35-0] free ourself [fm2,-] from the provisional basket-ball courts [np6,3-0] .
The old courts [np6,8-0] were [vp6,52-1] covered with sands.
After it raided the old courts were [vp6,62-5] always being [vp6,4-1] covered with water.
When the new basket-ball courts [np6,78-0] were [vp6,79-2] set up, we would never feel helpless in face of a task beyond our capability.
We were [vp6,1-4] expecting the day's coming.
Boyzone
Boyzone is the band of Ireland.
There are five members in it.
They are Ronan, Stephen, Keith, Shane, and Mikey.
Last year, They [fm3,-] published the first record of their own.
In this record, there were three hit singles.
It was the hit single [fm2,-] Love me [fm3,-] for a reason [fm3,-] that made them famous.
This year, they published their new record.
Soon the single [fm2,-] Words [fm2,-] in it [fm3,-] climb [vp6,12-4] up the Pop Notice.
In our class, there are some people who like them very much.
We are intoxicated with its melodions [fm1,-] singing.
Pride Make [vp3,-] Fall
I fell again.
I made the same mistake.
It is pride.
In three tests which had been on in this [np9,1-2] two weeks, I lagged behind, because of pride.
It had surrounded [cc3,-1] me for one year.
After I changed [wd3,2-3] it last term, I made a progress.
ut, In this [np9,1-2] two weeks, I follow [vp6,7-4] the same disastrous road.
Of course, I fell again.
Now, I must changed [vp4,1-2] it again.
I must pull my forces together and tart [fm1,-] afresh.
The Worst Luck In [wd5,0-2] this Wednesday, I met the worst luck.
From evening to evening, there were six or seven rains [cc1,-2] of sand blown into my left eye.
The biggest one must be the one that was blown into my left eye on the intersection of Taibao Street I [fm1,-] the evening.
As soon as it entered my left eye, I had to stop my bike.
I stayed on the intersection or several minutes.
But it had not any improvement.
So I had to go only by the left eye.
Cursing the gob, [fm3,-] I get [vp6, -3] to my classroom.
I had a rest for fifteen minutes.After that, I washed out [wd7,1-4] at about eight o'clock.
It took me more than forty-five minutes to with it [vp2,9-0] !
Hong Kong Be [vp6,-] Better, Tomorrow
Today, the Qingma Bridge in HK was [vp6,5-3] brought to completion.
It is the largest bridge in the world.
Its steel ropes are so long that they can circle the earth four times in all.
It has two strata [wd7,3-13] , Cars [fm3,-] run on the upper stratum [wd3,13-0] and trains run on the other one.In the evening, there held a large celebration for that [pr1, 9-0] , including the play of the fireworks.
The grand play is so wonderful that the spectators let out the surprised shout from time to time.
The last act, "Hong Kong will Be Better, Tomorrow"' gave the finishing touch.
Hong Kong will be better, tomorrow.
I believe this will be reality [cc2,2-0] .
The Qingma Bridge's completion firms us.
Who Control [vp4,1-1] Whom?
In the 1990's, the development of computer took on a very high speed.
The competition between the computer company [np3,4-0] became keener.
This made the price if [fm1,-] the computer lower and lower.
And [wd5,0-3] more and more new products appear .
In this side [wd3,2-0] man controlled the computer.
But, with the renewal of the computer., the software developed so fast , that "486" had been unfitted for the software's development.
This made the people who were using "486" or "386" have to change their computer into "586", or they would not use the new softwares [np5,-] well.
In [wd3, 0-2] this side, computer controlled [vp6,0-5] man.
No matter who controls whom, this relation will make the society develop even faster, and it has done [pr1,2-0] .
The Trouble By The Termites [fm1,-] 
The last self-study hours in the evening this Wednesday , wrote down the awkwardest [aj3,1-1] position [cc3,6-6] in the history of my class.
There were a lot of termites.
At the night.
Because they always against [wd2,2-3] to our body, we used all kinds of ways to drive off [wd3,-] or kill them.
Some struck them by hand [np6,-] , some by book [wd3,-] , even some by rule.
Even [ad1,0-4] there was a classmate who put the termites into a bottle.
The other classmates called this "the tea of chrysanthemum".

The teachers are excellent.
They are strict with the students, and the students respect them.
After The Flood
As we all knew, the great flood had [vp6,3-2] broken out in Conghua and Huadu.
This is the largest flood in Guangdong 500 years.
But, out of my estimation, the victims of the natural disaster didn't [vp6,23-6] show too much lament.
Their calm [wd2,1-2] shook me very much.
As soon as the water turned back, they took an active part in rebuilding their house [np6,8-0] .
From them, I saw the strongwilled [wd2,3-0] ; I saw the active life.
In the disaster area, there is a lot of rice field which wasn't [vp6, 12-1] submerged by the flood.
It still grows well.
This is a good omen.
It means they will have the [np7,5-2] good harvest.
June, 14 Afternoon Nearby 30 degree centigrade
In this afternoon, it was very hot.
Outside the windows, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river.
It seemed that most of them were good at swimming.
There was a little girl learning swimming, too.
Her mother was teaching her.
This made me think of my childhood.
At that time, I often swam, too.
About ten years go, [fm1,-] when I was spending my holiday in Beijing, I swam for the last time.
June is the best month of a year, I believe.

My Friends
When I was a child, I had many good friends in my contry [fm1,-] side.
We studied and played together.
Then I was so happy.
However, at the age of ten, I had to the city which is named Xinxiang.
I was lucky to make some new friends here [wd3,14-] .
In a school of Xinxinang, I spent three years as a pupil.
Those days were [wd4,3-5] most happy of my life, because there are [vp6,11-5] many good friends around me.
Now, I hope very much that I can see them again.I still remember that [wd3,4-7] day which [pr5,s-] I first came to school.
When I came into class and sat down, my Chinese teacher introduced me to all the pupils who were in my class, then they looked at me, I was so afraid, I thought they must be laughing at me.
 [fm3,-] , they told me, "Welcome to our class, you have been [vp6,2-] a pupil of our class.
" After I listened [wd3,4-5] to this, I was so exciting [vp5,9-] , but I only laughed and said," Thank you!
Thank you !
" three [fm3,-] years later, I left my school, I began to study in a famous Middle School in Xinxiang.
I made many new friends but I also missed [wd3,s-] many friends.
From making friends, I really know what the lift [fm1,3-1] is.
Life of people can't be good and also can't be bad all the time.
If you know the meaning of life, you must know how to live and how to make friends.
from [fm3,-] now on, I will try my best to make more friends, to make better friends.
I hope that everybody also can make more and better friends.
in [fm3,-] that case our life will change [wd3,3-4] more and ore happy , we also [ad1,2-6] will change [wd3,4-4] more and more friendly.

She did lots of things for me, and so did I. we [fm3,-] did many things together, such as swimming, study, even succeed [wd2,s-] or fall [fm1,2-] and so on.
that [fm3,-] time we used to be happy, but then everything was changed [vp7,3-] .
She had a strange illness, and [wd4,1-3] the same time, I was studiing [fm1,-] computer.
So I left her and I also knew I had hurt her.
I think I have a lot of friends, but she is the best.
after [fm3,-] many years, now I think I lost her, but she don't [vp9,2-2] lose me.
Because those years I rember [fm1,-] her all the time, because she is my best friend, because I love her .

ZHAO MIN English Study
in [fm3,-] schools boys and girls are leaning [fm1,-] languages.
Do you know how many languages there are in the world?
The teacher told us there [wd4,5-2] about 1500, she also said that English is one of the most important languages because so many people use it, not only in England and America, but in other contries [fm1,-] of [np7, 5-1] world, so study [vp4,1-6] English is very important for us , if we study English well, it will be very useful for us.
some [fm3,-] girls who study English found that it is difficult to study English.
For example, hare [wd7,3-5] some difficulty in produacing [fm1,-] some world [wd3,6-] , make [vp4,5-5] this grammer [fm1,-] into other grammer [fm1,-] and so on.
because [fm3,-] of these reason [np6,4-] , they found English is very hard to learn.
The teacher told us that who find English is hard to learn as they don't find the best way to learn [np7, 4-2] foreign language .
Which is the best way to learn a foreignage [fm1,-] ?
We know that we all learn our own language well when we were still children.
if [fm3,-] we learn a second language in the same way , it won't seem so difficult.
How does a small child do?
He listen [vp3,2-4] to what people say and he tries to guess what people say.
When he wants something, he has to ask for it.
he is using the language, thinking in it and talking in it all the time.
So we learn English should be speak it as much as possible and using and thinking in it as many [wd3,7-3] as you can.
If you that, I think you will learn English very, and find it easy.
I hope all the boys and girl [np6,s-] will learn English well.
MARX AND FORETGH SANGUAGES
Karl Marx was a man of great learning .
he [fm3,-] had wide knowledge in foreign languages.
Marx knew several foreign languages.
He needed them for his revolutionary work.
He could read [wd4,3-5] all the main European languages, and write in French and English.
He said:" A foreign languge [fm1,-] is very important in one's life.
" Marx was born in Cermany [fm1,-] .
when [fm3,-] he was very young , he was forced to leave his motherland because of his revolutionary reasons.
he [fm3,-] stayed in France for a time [wd3,7-] , but before long, he had to move on again.
In 1849 he went to London and looked upon it as the base of his revolutionary work.
Marx had learned some English before he went to England.
When he got there he found that his English was not good enough, so he worked hard to improve it .
he [fm3,-] made rapid progress and soon he began to write articles in English for a newspaper.
In fact, in one of these articles his English was so good that Engels wrote him a setter [fm1,-] and praised him for it .
when [fm3,-] he wrote the Civil War in France, he had mastered English so well that he was able to write in it.
in [fm3,-] the 1870's, when Marx was already over 50, he began to learn Russian because he wanted to study the situation in Russian .by [fm3,-] the end of six months he had learned enough to read articles and reports in Russian.
In one of his books, Marx had this to say about has to learning a foreign language.
" in [fm3,-] the same way, the person who has learned a new language always translates it into his own.
Only when he can use the new language without thinking of his own language , we can say that he can learn a foreign language.

my [fm3,-] father is forty-four years old.
He is [np7,s] worker and works in a big factory called Xing Fei.
When I was two years old, he was working in Bei Jing [fm1,-] .
one [fm3,-] day the electrycal [fm1,-] [wd2,2-2] hit him and he was quickly taken to hospital.
He sleeped [fm1,-] two days and he woke up at last.
I was so glad though I was only two years old at that time.
When I was a little bigger [wd3,6-5] , father [fm3,-] often worked in factory, so he had no time to play with me.
He played with me , told me stories and taught me characters, when he was freed my father very much.
Three years ago, we had known my father's heart was ill. We were so ad but he wasn't sad like wd3,s-] he didn't know the thing.

I have a lot of friends, from when I'm a childe [fm1,-] I thought everyone must have friends.
so [fm3,-] I got everywhere I can make friends.
when [fm3,-] I stayed in the childrens [np6,2-1] ' house [wd3,3-] .
I found a girl who is [vp6,s-] beautiful and lovely.
I wanted to make friend [vp2,s-] with her.
later [fm3,-] I knew her name is Zhao bo .
she [fm3,-] is a good girl.
We knew each other and we became good friends.
when [fm3,-] I left the childrens' house [wd3,5-] and went into school.
I left with [vp1,s-] Zhaobo, however, I remember her for ever .
then [fm3,-] I founded [wd3,3-2] Pan Ling, which [pr5,6-6] has a pair of big eyes and a lovely mouth .
she [fm3,-] very clever and got very well with her studies.
We studied each other,played [wd4,-] each other.
We are good friends .
but [fm3,-] when we were in the Grade 4.
Her family moved to AnYang.
so [fm3,-] we must be devide [fm1,-] [wd3,10-] .
we [fm3,-] were crying [vp6,7-] .

could [fm3,-] you make [vp2,1-3] friend with me?
An English Joke
when [fm3,-] I was young , I had ever made a joke.
At that time I was about twelve years old.
I first went to the Middle School.
The first lesson was English, the teacher taught us some sentences which used usually [wd3,9-] .
I recorded then [fm1,-] though I didn't know what they meant.
The next day I went to the English teachers' office to take my homework back.
the [fm3,-] teacher who taught me English asked me: "what's your name?
" I didn't know what she said, but I remembered some words.
So I thought for a moment , and said :"I'm twelve!
" the [fm3,-] teacher smiled to me I think :"the [fm3,-] teacher was [vp6,5-6] smiling , my answer must be right.
" So [wd5,-s] I was very happy, because I said a right answer by myself .
but [fm3,-] when I know the truth, my face turned red at me [wd5,2-] .
I said to myself: "you [fm3,-] are very foolish, you mustn't make the same joke!
You must learn English hard and well!
" so [fm3,-] I was interested in English from then on.
I must thank to [wd5,-] this joke, because it eruacrage [fm1,-] [vp6,s-] me to like English and learn it hard [wd3,10-] .
I think the joke was [vp6,s-] very good.
CHINESE LANGUAGE
Chinese is spoken by the largest number of people in the world .
as there are over 1200000000 people in the [wd5,s-] China .
but [fm3,-] why the most popular language in the world is English, not Chinese?
there [fm3,-] must be a political reason in history.
China is one of the oldest countries in the world.
Long ago, Chinese language was very famous.
Many people who lived in other countries were sent abroad by sea to China in the Tang period.
They studied Chinese language and the good ideas on work .
tens [fm3,-] of thousands of people said that China was the strongest country.
Also, China was considied [fm1,-] to be the largest market in the world.
During the Qing period, scores of westerners went to China.
but they were no longer kind.
They looked down upon Chinese , taking up many land whick [np3,5-3] [fm1,-] belonged to china.
they [fm3,-] also made a plan for taking up all the world.
English is spoken in the place which had been taken up by the westerners.
However, Chinese is more and more important today.
Many people begin to study Chinese.
Maybe Chinese will be the most popular language one day.
My favourite Song
have [fm3,-] you heared [fm1,-] of this song: "Happy birthday to you.
" I think you must say "yes ", because this song is very popular and common on birthday and it's easy for us to sing.

So I imegimed [fm1,-] the lovely time.
However, I still remember when I have [np6,s-] my birthday of 14.
Something happen [vp3,s-] to me.
On that day I received a letter from my parents they said they were too bust [fm1,-] to go [wd3,8-6] home and to [wd5, 9-3] celebrate my birthday.
I could not believe it, because I have [vp6,8-9] been look forward this day for a long tome, how dispointed [fm1,-] I was!
I walked on the street lonely I wanted to cry.

Lei Kai A FAITHFUL POG [fm1,-] 
more [fm3,-] than seven hundred years ago, the Prince of Wales had a very big and brave pig, Gelert.
One day the Prince wanted to go hunting with his men.
He wagged his tail and jumped u0p [fm1,-] to put his paws on the Prince's cheat [fm1,-] .
Then the Prince saw the blood on Gelert's jaws and head.
"what [fm3,-] have you done?
" the Prince said.
he [fm3,-] rushed into his home and looked for his baby son.
The cradle was lying in [wd3,s-] its side on the floor.
The clothes were tom [fm1,-] and there was blood on them.
"so [fm3,-] you have killed my son!
" the Prince said angrily.
" you [fm3,-] unfaithful pig!

The prince can [fm1,-] out of the house and saw his son lying on the ground unhurt?-if [fm3,-] you of [wd7,3-5] to Mount Snowdon in Walas ,people will show you where Gelert is buried.
There is a sign by his grave.
It reminds people of a brave and faithful pig.
my [fm3,-] country is China, with its capital Beijing.
China is in the east of Asia, and is the third largest country.
In the eastern part is rather flat ,although there are hills in the northest [fm1,-] and in the southeast of it.
in [fm3,-] the western part has many mountains, for example, Ti'an mountain [fm3,-] Qi lian mountain [fm3,-] , and so on.
China is made up of 32 provinces, for example, my hometown He nan province [fm3,-] .
Hu bei province [fm3,-] , and so on.
in [fm3,-] China, most people live mainly on wheat and rice .
in [fm3,-] the northeast, people grow wheat.
And in the southeast.
People grow rice.
Because the weather is different .
In winter , here is cold , and in summer, here is hot .
In China the southern part have [vp3,s-] much [aj3,s-] water than the northern part.
So, the southern part should [vp8,s-] grow rice, and the northern should [vp8,s-] grow wheat, China have [vp3,2-2] many production [wd3,4-4] , for example, teas [np5,7-1] , China [fm3,-] , coal, oil, pears, and so on .
I think China is great, and I like it very much , and you ?

here [fm3,-] , I tell you a story about Du Qiu niang.
She was a farmous [fm1,-] dancer in Jin Ling of Tang period.
At young old [wd7,3-] , she recognized [wd3,s-] Zhu Ying.
they [fm3,-] were after play together.
after [fm3,-] a few years, Zhu Ying had to [wd4,4-4] chang'an to take a [np7,2-1] exam, and then he was beaten to death.
Du Qiu niang married Li Qi , who was [np7,s-] king of Jin Ling.
Befor [fm1,-] long, Li Qi wanted to [wd4,4-4] emperor of Tang period so he was beaten, however [fm3,-] ,Du Qiu niang was arrived [vp7,5-3] in ching'an [fm1,-] and came into Hong'gong.

So I like it very much.
HAND SIHNS [fm1,-] LANGUAGE
there [fm3,-] is one language that is for use in every country in the world.
Also, neither so young nor so old .
Short and tall, also either so short or so tall, thin and fat; also neither so thin nor so fat .
it's [fm3,-] every body [wd3,s-] 's second language.
it's [fm3,-] easy to learn and easy to understand.
But you can't hear it.
it's [fm3,-] sign language.
When you ware [fm1,-] to a friend who is across [wd3,5-3] by the street, you ate [fm1,-] hsing [fm1,-] [np7,s-] sign language.
When you smile to someone, you are saying, "I want to be made [vp7,s-] friend," but you are not speaking.
When you rise [vp1,3-4] your [wd4,4-3] and in class, you are saying," Please ask me, I think I know the correct answer.
" Babies who can't talk can pornt [fm1,-] at think .
polsee [fm1,-] [fm3,-] man who wants to stop traffic holds up his hand.
He's to use [vp6,s-] [np7,s-] sign language.
Now you see however, either there or here .
both you and me , the hand signs language is me.
How many sign language do you use everyday .
TELEVISION
television [fm3,-] has mow [fm1,-] come to nearly every family in the world.
It has become a very important part in the [wd5,s-] people's life.
many [fm3,-] school [np6,s-] in China have television [np6,s-] .
School children in some part of China always watch TV.
Some of [wd5,2-7] feel that television is good for children because it helps them learn about their country and the world.
It also helps children to do every thing [wd3,s-] better in the [wd5,s-] school.
Other people feel that television is bad for children.
they [fm3,-] feel that there are too many programes [fm1,-] about love and crime on TV.
And that even programmes of education don't help children's enducation [fm1,-] .
If children watch too much TV .
They don't a lot important things about their study .
Children of three to five need to study their own language and talk with people.
If they watch TV, they don't need talk [vp5,s-] .
They only need to listen.
So that they couldn't speak their own language very .
When school children watch TV, they read a lot less [wd7,s-] .
Because of this they don't learn to read or write as [wd5,s-] quickly at school.
All children want to watch TV some said that children needed time to play in order to learn about the world.
when [fm3,-] they watch TV, they play less.
They also have less time to do with their parents and friends, and they have less time to have sport.
Recently, many families in China decided to stop watching TV for a month or more.
Tat [fm1,-] first it was difficult but soon a sot [fm1,-] of good changes.
the [fm3,-] children read, played, and exercised more, and the family became full of joy.
but [fm3,-] at the end of [np7,55- 8] month all the families began to watch TV as much as before.
not [fm3,-] [wd3,s-] one family is able to give up television completely.
SAY English
which [fm3,-] language is spoken by the largest number of people in the world?
Of course, the answer is Chinese.
However, why do we the Chinese students have learn English, that's because English is the most widely spoken in the world.
So we are very lucky, we can speak both of them, though some of s speak English not very well.
English is spoken in many countries and areas, for example, the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and HongKong.
in [fm3,-] [wd4,1-2] modern world, English becomes more important and more important [aj3,7-] .
In everyday life, you can use it.
many [fm3,-] things with instruction is [vp3,5-2] in English, such us [fm1,-] "made in ?-?-,turn on, turn off.
" Some times [wd3,2-6] we wath [fm1,-] TV or see [np7,6-1] film, that [pr1,s-] 're also in English.
if [fm3,-] we go broad, first we must be able to speak English.
If not, you can't be allowed to go.
so [fm3,-] we must learn English hard, if we have some diffecince [fm1,-] we can't [vp9,7-2] afraid [wd2,8-1] it.
I think if we learn hard, we can master English whis [fm1,-] is the most widely.
MY HOUSE
my [fm3,-] house is not very big, but I like it very much.
If you get into my house, on your right is a book shape [wd3,1-] .

THE UELLOW [fm1,-] CRANE TOUER [fm1,-]

it [fm3,-] is 51.4 metres high.
In the halls of the first four storeys there are many.
Prictunes [fm1,-] .
Portrants [fm1,-] and wall-paintings.
they [fm3,-] are about fairly [fm1,-] tales, Chinese history and the history of the tour [wd3,5-6] .
do [fm3,-] you know when the tower was first built?
And why do we call it "the Yellow Crane Tower"?
there [fm3,-] is a legend that long.
Long [fm3,-] ago are old man named Wang Zhian rode on the back of a yellow crane .
flew away from the tower and later became an tmmortal [fm1,-] being .
it [fm3,-] is also said that anther [fm1,-] man raved [wd3,3-3] .
Fei wei wei retuatted [fm1,-] to the toner [fm1,-] to have a rest with the help of a yellow crane.
Another story goes like this: a [fm3,-] window [wd3,2-10] by the name of xin [fm3,-] set up a public house by the Suake Hill in WuChand.
A Taoist often came to drink here.
Each time he was allowed to drink without payment.
Once before leaving .
The Taoist drew a yellow crane flew down off the wall and danced happily immediately after the people dapped [wd3,3-2] their hands .
On hearing the new [wd7,s-] many .
Many people cane [fm1,-] here for a drink.
Mrs Xin got richer and richer.
So the [fm1,-] decided to build a tower in menoy [fm1,-] of the crane.
it [fm3,-] was named the Yellow Crane Tower.
in [fm3,-] fact, the Yellow Crane Tower was first built more them [fm1,-] 1,600 years ago.
That is in the taring [fm1,-] year of the Three-kingdom period.
It stood on the south bank of the Ching Jiang River in Wu Chandg.
in [fm3, -] October 1981 the government decided to rebuild the Tower and on the top of the Snake Hill stands a new mang [fm1,-] nifrcent [fm1,-] five-storiyed [fm1,-] Yellow Crane Tower .

in [fm3,-] the United States if you want to invite a friend to dinner you must tell him the place and tine [fm1,-] one or two weeks before hand.
at [fm3,-] the same time you should tell him who else besides him will come to the dinner.
If you are the person invited and you accept the invited [wd2,4-] you'd better keep your promise and go to [np7,6-3] dinner on time.
at [fm3,-] least you mustn't [vp8,2-14] change your mind at your pleasure if something unexpected really prevents you from coming, you must tell the host or hostess about it several days before the dinner for at that time the host or hostess must have begun to go shopping and prepare for the dinner it is always considered impolite to tell the host or hostess that you are not able to came [vp4,6-4] at the last minute.

He sent out hundreds of men to bring snow and ice from the mountains.
The Roman emperor Nero used to use the snow and ice to make cold drinks.
Traveler Maco Pdo brought back recipes for chilled and frozen milk from China.
Hundreds of years later, ice cream reached England.
It is said that King Charles I enjoyed that treat very much.
There is a story that be [wd3,6-7] ordered his cook to keep the recipe for ice cream a royal secret.Today ice cream is known by the world.
Americans alone eat more than two billion quarts a year.
But I don't think ice cream is a healthy diets [np6,3-] , because it's high in fat and sugar.
sugar [fm3,-] is not a necessary part of a healthy diet.
Though ice cream is very delicious, but [cj1,s-] you'd better eat less.

When I wrote the diary, we had finished the mid-term examination.
We could have a rest at home in [wd3,0-2] two days.
At [wd3, 2] the afternoon I always go [vp6,7-2] to bed.
I was very tired.
I had to give up playing.
In the spare time .
I would watch TV or listen vp2,1-1] music.
Except that, I would go over [cc3,1-2] the knowledge.
One night I listened [vp2,1-3] a [np7,0-2] English song.
It called [vp7, 1- 2] " here [fm3,-] waiting" [fm3,-] .
Miss, you help me?
Please write down the first word.

When we got there, we traveled the "sky lake" first.
After lunch we began to climb the mountain.
We felt very tired because of climbing the mountain.
In the bus we were almost asleep.
December 7.
The weather became cooler and cooler in this week.
If I had worn the clothes enough [wd1,2-0] , I shouldn't have got a bad cold.
It affected my study and living.
But I wouldn't give in it [wd5,4-0] .In this weather we must have sports.
Otherwise we will feel cooler and cooler.
I chose to play football on Saturday.
That ay we didn't give up playing football until it became dark.
After playing football, I felt very warm.
But when I went home, I changed my clothes at first.
Otherwise I must [vp9,1-2] got fever.
By the way, can you tell me what is " Right here waiting" mean .
December 7.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he as going to give his invention to the government.
This invention of his will greatly benefit the whole world, so two government officials would come for the papers at eleven o'clock in the morning.
But two thieves shut the right men in an empty house and took away their cards.
And two impostors got to the [wd5,1-3] professor [fm3,-] Hunter's house at half past ten.
As they looked too nervous and were too anxious to leave, the professor didn't trust them.
He only gave them some other papers, and they left in a hurry.
Shortly after that, two police officers came to his house.
They said that the two men were impostors, and they must try hard to catch them.
But he professor said it was not necessary.
Because he still kept he papers on his invention .
December 15.
I like to listen [vp2,1-1] music and like to sing songs, too.I usually listen [vp2,1-2] Chinese songs more than English ngs [fm1,-] .
But I also very [ad2,2-4] like some English songs.
"Yesterday Once More", " Say You, Say Me", "Right Here Waiting", "Loving You" are very wonderful.
I like them very much.
I don't only like these songs.
I don't know some songs [np4,1-1] name [np6, 2-0] .
But I think everyone will like these songs.
Though I don't know some words .
I often sing them.
e must often listen [vp2,1-2] English songs and sing them.
It can improve our English.
December 21. Who attended the acting in our class spent some time in practising.
Though we didn't try our best to practise, we practised very seriously.
We didn't leave school, until it turned dark.
But the other classes, they spent every night to practise .
I think that it isn't well [wd2,5-0] .
If they waste much time to practise.
It must affect their studying.
In [wd5,0-2] this time our main duty is [wd4,5-1] study.
The end of term is coming, we shouldn't waste time to do the others things.
The weather turned colder and colder.
Some students must [vp9,-1] Wear clothes.
I hope they don't have a cold.
Because that will have effect in their studying .
Finally I wish we can enter the finals.
December 29.
On Saturday morning who attended the acting in our class went to the theatre at 8:45.
We went there early in order that we have [vp6,8-5] enough time to make up.
We spent two hours on [wd3,4-2] making up.
At last we must [vp9,-] go to act.
But someone affect [vp6,2-1] us.
Then we failed.
All of us were very disspointed [fm1,-] .
Though we failed, we couldn't discourage.
 [vp7,2-0] The final exam is coming.

We always say: " We are always the BEST!
"
January 5.
The final exam is coming.
we [fm3,-] have nine days to go over.
I will try my best to pass it.
But my English base [cc4, -2] isn't good.
I forgot the words very easy [wd2,5-0] , and I didn't remember again in time.
So I was afraid to make sentences.
My English [cc4,1-3] feeling isn't good.
Perhaps I didn't read enough.
Perhaps I didn't do my best to study English.
Though that, I will go over it carefully.
My chinese [fm3,-] base [cc4,2-2] isn't good.
I must go over it carefully, too.
Only nine days !
The time isn't enough.
I didn't want to write so much.
I'd better go over now.
My winter holiday
The date was February 1.
It was Saturday, my first holiday in winter.
When I was doing my chinese [fm3,-] homework, my father was cleaning the kitchen .
My father had to clean alone because my mother had to go to work that day.
Though I was very busy, I regretted I had never given him a hand.
Though that, I had never made him disappointed.
I became a cook and cooked some food to eat together.
He was very happy.
I promised if I had spare time.
I would do some housework.
This winter holiday seemed that we had some time to rest.
But in fact wasn't like that.
We had plenty of homework.
We must finish it quickly.
We must prepare [cc3,2-3] the new knowledge and go [cc3,1-4] over the old knowledge in this winter holiday.
We had only thirteen days to do it so that I had almost finished the homework before February 1.Except maths and physics, I must [vp9,1-9] wasted a long time to work out every question.
I think I will [vp9,3-2] very light-hearted in February 7.
I will receive some money.
I will have spare time to rest.
Finally I wish everybody happy Spring Festival.
The Spring Festival
February 6 was the day before the Spring festival.
I had prepared some sweets and some cookie [np6,1-0] to past [wd2,9-3] the Spring Festival.
In the evening the supper was very plentiful.
I ate enough.
After supper my family went to the flower market.
There were a lot of flowers.
Plenty of people looked like a sea.
All kinds of flowers made the road very beautiful.
There were some market [np6,1-6] on each side of the road.
We could go for some food or buy something.
The date was February 7.It was the first day of the Spring Festival.
I congratulated my parents on everything as soon as I woke up.
My parents gave me two "red bags".
There was some money in the "red bags".
They wished me grow faster and study well.
After breakfast we went to give [cc3,1-3] the relative congratulations.
At that time I could receive some "red bags".
I almost did the same work in several days.
I felt very light-hearted.
Though that, I must go [cc3,2-3] over the knowledge.
I shouldn't do nothing in several days.
Break Away The Habit February 1 was the first day of the winter holiday.
I almost finished my homework.
That day was Saturday.
I used to watch TV or listen [vp2,1-1] music.
But I knew I shouldn't waste time.
So I reduced to listen music and watch TV.
But I still watched TV in the evening because I had formed the habit.
Finally I decided to break away [wd4,4-2] the habit.
Every day I permited [fm2,-] myself to watch the news in the evening.
Every evening I spent out four hours in doing homework.
In the public holiday [np6,-0] I watched TV at most one hour.
I will break away [wd4,3-2] the habit before go [vp5,1-2] to school.
At that time I think I can break away [wd4,1-2] the habit completely.
I won't watch TV every day including the public holiday.
What's the mean [wd2,-] ?
One day mother and I went to a restaurant for some food.
I looked around the restaurant after I sat down at a table.
I saw a man who can [vp6,5-4] not speak sit down at the other table beside us.
The waiter asked him what he wanted.
The man opened his mouth, put his fingers in it and took them out gain.
The waiter soon brought him a cup of tea.
The man moved his head from side to side.
The waiter took away the tea.
In a moment hi brought a cup of coffee.
The man again moved his head from side to side.
At last the man put his hand on the stomach.
At that time I understood what's the mean.
He wanted some food.
In a few minutes there was a large plate of meat and vegetables in front of him.
After that I learned his signs.
I wanted mother to suppose what I wanted.
But mother had seen that [wd5,3-3] what had happened and ordered some food which I like [vp6,5-0] .
March 9.
It was our turn to be on duty last week.
It was the first week at [pp1,-3] the next term.
Everywhere was very dirty.
A lot of leaves spreaded [fm2,-] all over the table.
Though hat, we were not afraid to clean them.
We were afraid to get up so early.
Every morning we must get to school before 7 o'clock.
Some of us didn't have breakfast until the second class was over.
Every day my team must clean the leaves.
I thought my team was the most careful in our class.
In that week all of us were very tired.
But that week had gone [vp6,4-0] .
We could sleep enough.
March 15.
We handed in some books for some poor children and some people in the country.
It was the first time of the new term.
Perhaps it was the last time.
But it was very useful.
I thought the books were more useful than money, because we handed in all kinds of books.
So the poor children could learn [cc3,1-5] the knowledge of all sides.
This could make them recognize this world quickly.
Some ways could make the people who lived in country improve the agricultural production, and improve their living condition.
March 23.
Recently, I was surprised at two pieces of news.
The first piece of news was about the clone experiment.
When the person of world heard the news which the clone experiment has succeeded, everyone was very surprised at it.
Since the sheep was reproduced in British, everyone has been afraid of seeing a person will be reproduced.
Though a lot of people were against this experiment, some people were for it.
They thought this experiment could [vp9,4-3] reproduced some organs what the patients needed.The second piece of news was about examination.
We must have a hearing [wd3,-] test in the examination.
I was afraid to have a hearing [wd3,-] test.
So I hope Miss Lin can give us a lot of chances to hear English in order that I can improve my hearing.
March 30.
Guang Zhou [fm2,-] is a modern city.
It had been [vp6,2-3] a beautiful city.
But today it isn't more beautiful than before.
The smog in Guang Zhou [fm2,-] was sometimes so thick and filled with pollution.
I think the factories and homes burned the coal was a major cause.
The fog have [vp3,2-4] so many harmful chemicals.
People who lived [vp6,2-10] in Guang Zhou [fm2,-] saw the sky and found it wasn't blue.
It often have [vp3,2-2] some fog.
So we must begin to solve the air pollution problem of GuangZhou.
 [fm2,-] Otherwise it must do harm for our health.
Another problem of Guang Zhou [fm2,-] is the pollution of the Zhu Jiang [fm2,-] River.
If we do not solve the water pollution problem in time, the fish will no longer live in the river.
I am eager o swim in it in the future.
April 6.
The date was April 4.
We were going to run around the street in the morning.
It kept on in the morning.
I thought we didn't need to run.
So I got to school at 7:30.
When I got to school, a lot of students who were our grade were waiting in [wd3,0-2] the first floor.
They were talking about if they must run in the rainy day.
At last a teacher told us to walk with raincoats.
We had to walk instead of running, because he street was very smooth [wd3,12-] .
So I thought it was worth running in the rainy day, because it had lost its meaning [wd7,15- 0] .
We talked everything with each other in the street.
When we walked about five hundred metres, the teacher told us we needn't go on walking.
Then we must [vp9,s] come back to school at once.
So we were very angry.
It made us waste a little time.
I wondered why we should be sent to run.
April 13.
I have two tortoises in my home.
I like them very much.They ave become my good friends.
They are not longer than a finger.
But they are very lovely.
I spent 30 yuan on them.
They have been here for a year.
They half- hibernate in winter.
They needn't a lot of food.
They hardly makes [vp3,2-2] any movement.Sometimes I will play with them.
Sometimes I will observe their action.
I find they like swimming and eat a lot of food.
When I study in [wd3,0-3] a long time, I will go to see them.
After some time I will go on studying.
April 19.
The weather wasn't fine in this week.
Sometimes it was sunny.
Sometimes it was cloudy.
When I left home.
It was sunny.
But when I got to school, it became cloudy.
So I had to take the raincoat from time to time.
But I was very angry.When I took the raincoat, it didn't rain.
When I didn't take the raincoat , it rained.
So I must take the raincoat in [wd5,0-2] all day.
I come to know when we do everything, we don't give up until we finish it.
We must insist on studying hard.
April 26.
We had to study in chemical laboratory in [wd3,7-2] four days.
There is a playground in front of the chemical lab.
Every time many students play or have a lesson in [wd3,0-2] the play ground.
There was a lot of noise affected [vp5,6-2] our study.
It often drive [vp3,2-0] us mad.
I was afraid the football hit [vp9,-] the top of the house suddenly.
Though it had a lot of noise.
We could play after class.
After class we could [vp9,3-2] played badminton .
Someone played board game.
Someone played game in [wd3,0-3] the play ground.
All of us liked it very much.
Four days had past.
I was very happy.
I could leave there.
May 2.
The date was May 1.
That day was Labour Day.
My family and my grandmother, [wd4,6-6] my aunt went to Victory Hotel for breakfast.
My uncle or my aunt used to lead me to the restaurant for breakfast in my childhood.
My framily [fm1,-] and my grandmother's family often go the Hotel for breakfast in the festival now.
So have lost interested in the food of breakfast.
Now , when I go to the restaurant or the hotel for breakfast, I must buy a piece f newspaper.
I wouldn't have a lot of breakfast.
I would rather read the newspaper and have a cup of tea than eat something.
After breakfast we went shopping.
At noon, I had lunch in my grandmother's family.
Because I wasted a day, I had to give going to the BaiYun [fm2,-] Mountain.
But I think we will have some changes to play together in the future.
May 11.
We have had a new playground for a week.
We can play on it in spare time.
We only play basketball on it.
But every day there must be a lot of students on it.
After school some students would play basketball on it.
They didn't go [vp6,2-5] home until turned dark.
Though it was raining.
They still kept [vp6,2-3] on playing basketball.
 [wd4,0-5] Saturday some student [np6,s] would come [vp3,4-7] to school and play basketball on it.
They made [vp6,1-4] the school very busy.
It was difficult o see so busy before the new playground had [vp7,11- 1] completed.
But I hoped [vp6,2-5] it wouldn't affect their study.
May.
18.
My New School.
My school is a key school.
It has a history of seventy years.
Many graduates had become [vp6,3-2] famous people.

The students who study in it must study hard.
Their teachers must be proud of them.
May 24.
It was [vp6,1-6] difficult for me to learn English.
Though I was [vp6,2-7] weak in English, I found it interesting.
I believed [vp6,1-4] I could study well.
I have studied English for three years.
In these years I read more books and writed [fm2,-] articles in English.
I studied much harder so that I could improve it rapid progress.
After a few day, I tried to write articles in [wd3,5-1] newspaper.
I had ever [wd3,-] given [vp6,3-1] up.
I still carried on a newspaper.
May 30.
June 14.
Today the temperature was about thirty.
I saw about seven children swimming in the river.
They were almost [wd7,-1] good at swimming.
But who studied swimming first time or wasn't good at swimming, he must swim in the pool.
A little girl studied swimming in the pool, and her mother taught her.
I used to swim in my childhood.
I thought June was the best one of the year.
About ten years ago, I spent holidays in Beijing, it was the last time that [wd5,5-2] I swam.
June 15th.
Litter: my dear friend: My name is Wen Hua.
I am a student of No.1 Middle School in Beijing.
I had [vp6,1-15] to tudy far into the night, because I had a lot of homework every day.
Cars must all keep to the right side of the road in Beijing.But in London, cars must all keep to the left side of the road.
Almost [wd4,-1] people who live in Beijing go to work by bus or by bike.
We work five days in a week, and every day we work eight hours.
More and more people play in [wd3,0-1] outskirts in [wd3,0-1] weekend.
Count Stars
Tonight I work deep into the night gain.
Having gone over my lessons, I began to look at the sky through the window, instead of going to bed immediartely [fm1,-] .
After several days which with terrible weather, this night began turning nice.
You see, there're many twinkling stars in the sky.
One, two, three, four ...... oh, there're so many stars that can't count out how many they are.
Why there're so many stars in the sky?
I don't know but I think: the same as the stars, knowledge is also inexhaustible.
So I must try my best to study.
June 14th.
Sunny.
This afternoon was very hot, the temperature s about nearly [wd3,1-1] 30.
Through the window, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river, many of them are good at swim.
Among of them, a little girl was learning swim, and her mother was teaching her.
Then I thought that my last swimming was in Beijing when I spent my holidays about ten years ago.
I used to swim in my childhood, but now I haven't swam [fm2,1-] for about ten years, I think June is one of the best months in a year.

All Thess [fm1,-] Things Are To Be Answer [vp6,1-] 
For No one will forget the War of Resistance against Japanese aggression (1937-1945).
No one will forget that miserable times and [cc1,2-] seasons.
That's our Chinese shame!
How can us [pr4,2-1] forget!
In the days, many people were killed by the enemy; many women were raped by the enemy; and many riches [wd2,1-5] also were robbed by the enemy.
The Japanese Fascist brought with [wd5,3-4] heavy sufferings to Chinese and ever Asia.
But the Japanese Aggression are preparing [cc2,4-6] for the other sinister plot again when they have not pay [vp6,4-6] back for their criminal act still.
( To be continued)
All These Things Are To Be Answered for (continued)
In these days, all kinds of traces tell us ---- the Japanese Militarism will stage a come-back!
Some Japanese right wing elements had put up a light- house in Diao YuDao in July.
And the Japanese prime minister paid his respects to the JingGe Shen she,.... We wish the Japanese government don't do the foolish thinks again, because the new China is not the one of old.
All the people of Chinese [wd2,-] will not let it go!

The Pond In My Home
My home has a little pond-- a goldfish pond.
There are colour [cc1,-1] fish, peacock fish, dong yang knife fish and there two Bazie tortoises in it.
Over [wd3,0-7] the pond there's a man made [fm2,-] hill.
A waterfall drop [vp3,-] down from the hill into the pond.
In the water there's much send [wd3,1-0] , stones, corals and some water grasses in it.
All of them make the pond very beautiful.
The goldfishes [np6,-] lead [vp3,-] a freedom [cc1,-] life, but don't safe,because the dong yong [fm3,-] knife fish will eat the little fish.
So I set apart of them.
Now they live all [ad1,2-1] happly [fm1,-] .
Cold Autumn
Autumn is a beautiful and lovely season.
Many people like it very much.
Autumn is also a harvest season.
In autumn many leaves turn yellow, and many fruits [np5] have riped [fm2,1-] .
paddy [fm3,-] fields turn gold and [wd5,4-6] like sheet of gold sea.
The whole world turns a gold world.
Autumn is also a nice and cool season.
People feel very comfortable.
But it's also easy to catch fire, so people have to take [vp2, 1-2] care tinders [fm1,-] .
Even though this, I think Autumn is the best season as usual.
The Football Game
The football game is the first game in the world.
All over the world millions of people take part in the football game.
As much [np8,0-1] people do, I like play football and watch football matchs [fm2,-] too.
In our school, many students play football matchs [fm2,-] after a day of study at school, and so does [vp3,1-1] I. I felt relaxing [vp5,2-2] and exciting when I was playing the close game football with my classmases.
 [fm1,-] I felt very exciting [vp5,3-0] when I kicked the football into the ball door.
Sometimes I watch football matchs [fm2,-] in [wd3,0-1] home, including the Chinese and the foreign countrys.
 [fm2,-] As all the football game fans do, I like the world [fm3,-] Cup best.
Such as these, football is a part in my live [wd2,2-0] .
The Professor And His Invention Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of is invention.
And he was going to give his invention to London himself, but his daughter was sorry her father was not able to do that.
So two men from London would come to take the papers to London.
Before long two impostors came in .
be [wd5, 0-2] Professor Hunter saw through them and gave the wroung [fm1,-] papers to them.
Then two policemen came in for catching the two impostors because they shut the men from London in an empty house and took away their cards.
And then he would take the papers to London himself.
Haven't Passed The Test
Again I haven't passed the English test again this week, even though I have done hard in it [pp1,-] .
But I think I have maken [fm2,-] progress.
In some part .
For example I have done right ever seventy percent in the ingle choice.
Before it I only passed.
I tried to find out the reason from the test.
I think I reviewed without ever all, because I have done very bad in read and fill up.
I want to make bigger progress.
Even though it will takes me long time completed it.
I'll try my best and I'll succeed.

I think the art festival this year will [vp9,7-7] more excellent than the one last year.
I'm waiting [vp2,1-3] the art festival.
The Bookshelf In My Grandma's Home My grandma's home has a bookshelf and all the books are mine.
The bookshelf is over my desk and on the wall which in front of the desk.
It's about one metre high, one metre wide and trenty [fm1,-] centimetres thick.
There are about one hundred books in [wd3,-2] my bookshelf, but the book about learning is over fifty percent.
Then other books are all kinds of dictionaries, navels, [fm1,-] poems and so on.
All these books [cc4,2-5] are my riches [cc1,-2] in knowledge.
I could not have [cc3,3-3] so much knowledge without book.
So I like the bookshelf for book [wd5,4-0] .
The Test Of The Term [cc1,1-1] End The test of this term [cc1,1-1] end is coming.
it's a change to me because my test before it was very bad.
My achievement [cc2,1-10] stood in the lower reaches of river in my class.
hat achievement wasn't what I had hoped.
So I want to make a good achievement in the next test, now I wait till it.
I must catch the change.
Now I must study harder than before.
Or I will not make a great progress.
And as the same importance.
I must pay attention to have a good rest.

The New Year Of 1997.
The new year is coming.
the [fm3,-] city is overwhelmed with joy, and the people all [wd1,1-3] are preparing some foods for the new year and cleaning their house for the now year too.
So everyone is very busy but happy.
The same as passed, the weather is very cold this [pr3,-1] days, and with little rains.
Everywhere full of the beautiful scenery of spring in our Guangzhou.
Everybody is waiting in hope [wd4,1-4] the New Year's coming.
Because the New Year isn't the New Year passed.
It's the New Year of 1997.
It's not an ordinary New Year.
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival is the most important festival in China.
In the Spring Festival many people feel the happies [wd2,4-3] in a year and extraordinary a child do.
People would [vp6,1-17] buy some goods for the Spring Festival before the Spring Festival and name them New Year goods.
In [wd3,0-4] the New Year's Eve, every family must have the New Year supper the whole family.But this [pr3,-1] years many families like to have New Year supper in restaurants.
People always like to go to the flower market after New Year supper in Guang zhou.
(To be continued).
The Spring Festival (continued)
The flower markets about several hundred metres long, and there all kinds of flowers in it.
In the flower market [fm1,-] people always like to by some chrysanthemum blossoms, peach blossoms and some basins of gold orange.
Then the New Year come.
During the days people is always busy visiting year.
Children will receive a lot of lucky money.
So boys and girls like the Spring Festival very much.
After forteen days the YuanXiao day is coming.
and [fm3,-] with the day passed, then the spring festival is over.
Such is the Spring Festival in China.
My Winter Holiday
My winter holiday only has thirteen days, but I think it's a solid winter holiday.
In this winter holiday I must finish much homework, every day I do my homework, over three times and then go over my lesson, include during the Spring Festival.
During the Spring Festival I haven't visited year so many times as the same last year for the so much homework and rain.
This days I am going to finish my homework of the winter holiday, so I feel so relaxed.
The new term is coming.
I'll welcome it full of energy.
After Study By Oneself
In Evening
Every evening after study by oneself I come home with Yuanyoungxi, Liangjiaqu and Chenguoyi together.
Sure, this evening isn't exception.
During [wd3,0-3] the way home, we talked while we rided [fm2,-] bicycle.
Always we talked about earning, film, football match, basketball match and any others.
Now, we are talking about today's home work of methematics.
 [fm1,-] Before long I got to my home and have to say goodbye to them.
I just had a good time age.
The talking makes me very relaxed and joyful every evening.
Whiteboard
This week every classroom in our school fixed up white boards instead of blackboards.
The white board is made of iron.
We use black water pen instead of chalk, then the history of teacher' using chalk is over while a new history begins.
Of course, white board is good for people's healf [fm1,-] , but like every new thing always has shortcomings.
White board need to improve too.
Through I am sure about the new thing ----white board has good future [np7,2-] without limit.
How Funny Is He
It was night.
There was [vp3,1-4] just a few people in the street and there were few cars were seen once in a while.
 [,9-0] Four students let out of school ago.
Now they were going home by bike side by side in the street by bike [wd5,9-0] .
They were talking about something.
Laughing voice was sent out from them now and then, suddenly there's a pile of sand in the street ahead, Yuan said to the other one ---- Feng : look out!.
.." but Feng didn't understand and looked at his friends as before.
Of course, you all know what happened later: Feng stoke on the pile of sand.
Feng isn't foolish, so we only say him: how funny hi is.
But in any case it made us had a happy night that night.
Beijing In My Eyes
Beijing has many kinds of communication tool.
But one of them is used widely in any other city and few in Beijing.
This is motorcycle.
I envy the Beijing's people very much at this.
Though motorcycle run very fast, it's very dangerous.
Many motorcycles in city also will hinder conditions and communication tool for public use.
Now motorcycle is forbad many great cities [fm2,-] in the world.
Beijing go faster than any other city this in China.
When you walk on the street in Beijing, you well felt very safe and peaceful.
As a great city in the national in the future, Guang zhou should begin to think about it.
Red
Red make [vp3,1-2] people warm.
Though in cold weather, hen you see red thing and you will feel warm .
Red is fire's colour.
Red is revolution's colour.
During revolution's revolution [wd7,2-0] , red mean [vp3,1-2] new life.People like red.
China needs red.
When red is all over the country, the revolution will be won.
At last, people's red blood made the revolution won.
Later the national flag was dyed into red by people's red blood.
When the national flag wave in the country, the red sun is rising from the old east.
The country exists for ever.
The Singers Match In Our School
The preliminary of the singers match in our school was holded [fm2,-] this afternoon.
After the seventh lesson ended, the four singers in our class including me went to he music house immediately.
Three classmates finished singing, en it's turn to me [wd7,4-0] .
I sang the song named "I Am Chinese".
I sang the song only the high tide [cc1,-] part.
Because of the limiting f time .
I thought that I could enter the final after finished [vp5,1-1] singing.
Though I know the final is nothing with me, I glad to join in the match, [,7-0] because it gave me a chance to practise.
In The Finals
Today I took part in the finals of the singers [cc1,-1] match because of the extra number.
The finals include [vp3,1-] three parts: introduce my self, singing a song which you select, singing a song without accompanying in some parts.
Though my head teacher had [vp4,-] gave me some advices [np6,-] ,I feel I sang in the finals not better than in the preliminary, perhaps I felt critical in that time.
But to my surprise, I successed [wd2,-] finally.
I became one of the "ten reat [fm1,-] singers" in our school instead of extra number.
Have A Lesson In Noice
This week we had lessons in the chemical lab because the [wd5,0-2] Grade Three had modern examination in our classroom from Tuesday to this weekend.
The chemical lab is very bad for us to have a lesson.
Because when we were having a lesson, the students who in the other class were play [vp6,-] sport's game out of the lab.
Sudently [fm1,-] you would heard [vp6,5-20] a great noice [fm1,-] from the top of the lab, that is a football hited [fm1,-] the top of the lab weightly [cc5,6-] .
Now we will say good-bye to the lab and we know a quite condition is very important for us to have lessons.
The World Cup Table Tennis Match
I saw the Men's Team finals in the World Cup Table Tennis Match after study on my own in school last night.
The finals was [vp3,2-7] between our Chinese team and French team.
The points after the first two measare [fm1,-] words was 1:1.
So the third measare [fm1,-] word was very important.
In the third measare [fm1,-] word who is Wang tao our team's main forces won the first plate and took the lead in the second plate.
But Wang tao relaxed a little, the points turned into 21:21.
People was very critical at that time and points rose one after another.
As main forces Wang tao managed to win the plate.
And the points was 31:29.
The world record was broken!
Finally our Chinese team won the men's team finals.
They showed he heroic figure of our country's ball again.
A Terrible Night
I didn't study myself the night before last in school, though I had reached our classroom that night.
What's the reason?
Now I'll tell you.
The night is a terrible night.
Heavy raining, gale, lightening and thunder clap kept people in trouble riding on street.
Even severe, Tai bao zhi street was covered by water and the water level was about half a metre.
hat do you suppose?
Yes, you are right.
We could hardly go through the street.
Sof [fm1,-] when I got to our classroom .
I already looked like a hen in the water.
Then Miss Lin asked us to went [vp5,3-1] back.
What a terrible night!
Now you know the reason.
Right?

The life of Karl Marx
Karl Marx was born on May.
5th, 1818 in Germany.
he [fm3,-] studied at elin [fm1,-] University and lived in Germany, France, UK, and Belgium.
He moved to London in 1849.
He wrote many works, such as : The Civil War in France, On Capital and Communism Manifest, and so on.
He wrote articles about housing problem [np6,2-4] of the poor people and the hard life of the peasants.
He studied Russian, English, German, [wd4,5-0] French.
His political idea is [vp6,3-1] Communism.
Last week I was not lucky.
I was not satisfied with my results in [wd3,2-2] some subjects.
The results gave me a message that I hadn't put my heart into study and there's nothing had been worth pride.
Since the new term started, I haven't study [vp6,2-1] hard as I did last term, but some good results covered my problems.
This time the problem was shown, it struck the warning [cc1,-1] clock for me.
Now I am at the crossroads, if I went along this road, I must fail one day, if I take a correct attitude forwards study, I still have a big [cc4,-1] hope.
It is not too late to mend the fold [wd7, 1-0] even after some of the sleep [wd3,5-3] have been lost.
I have even written some articles to attack somebody and some systems.
Miss hinted that my way to suggest is not correct and sensible.
I still believed [vp6,2-0] sb's [fm2,-] argument is [wd5,2-3] hold water deeply, but at the some time I admitted my manner and some sentences in my articles are so extreme and excessive that they will make sick [cc4,-] effect and hurt somebody.
I say sorry to anybody that my articles have striken.
I know my view is too sharp, but I don't think my thesis is wrong in some question [wd3,-] .
I keep my suggestion.
I thank Miss, you make me know that some things are one of my business, so it is not necessary for me to speak at great length on some questions .
All the world are in the [wd5,1-1] contradictory.
I'd better put my heart into my study.
Going into the state The "Five-subject Test" will come in half and two months.
Four of them have already been finished teaching and began reviewing four weeks ago.
At first, I couldn't grasp [cc3,2-2] the spirit on [pp1,-] how to go [cc3,2-3] over my knowledge, so I was pulled [wd3,-] by them.
As time went on, I started to master [cc3,3-2] some ideas and I felt I was going into the state.
There are about two months that we take up our gauntlet : for a diligent student, the spare time was so full, but for a lazy one, it was little, which one I changed, it's depent [fm1,-] by me.
I decided to be a diligent one.
The streets I have been in the [wd5,1-3] No.4 Middle School or almost five years, the streets around the school have no change, too.
They are narrow and tattered in the ordinary times, the sick conditions of them are double in the rainy days.
So it is difficult for us to pass.
Now it is the rainy season, in the streets, there is mud, sand and dirty water here and there.
And one street which I usually pass to go to school is been repaired.
There are some large holes and they block the traffic.
So I am forced to pass: the other street to come or go to school.
Why can such streets have been laid here for five years and no one step out and suggest?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Football and I
My father is a football game an.
Under the influence of my father, I was interested in football game, both playing and watching.
As time went on, my interest in football became more and more.
When I became one student of our class, I found that there were a lot of football game fans in it.
So we had the same topic of conversation: football.
The football movement in our class improves so quickly.
And a group of master of football grow up.
I don't play football so good, but I still take an active part in it.
I wish the football movement in our country would be stornger [fm1,-] and stronger.
Last week, two new basketball playgrounds were finished building.
This made me happy.
We haven't seen a perfect basketball playground for four years, we didn't have enough palace to play since we were in grade Two.
So it was worth having a celebration.
In the other hand, the whole school was in deep sorrow at the news of our headmaster's death, for the people had come to love him as an inspiring leader and a wise, warm-hearted man.
Mr. Wang is one of the greatest of all the leaders in our school.
We believe that the living must finish the work of Mr. Wang.
We remember him for ever.
The tests of experiment.
Last week, we had three tests of experiment of biology, physics and chemistry.
In the ordinary time, I don't think it important to do experiments, so I didn't put my heart into it.
So last week I was in a frantic rush to deal with three different and difficult experiments.
I was so worried about that I would fail in them.
In order to pass the xam I went to the lab to demonstrate the experiments before the text.
Thank goodness, though I was so skilled and there were some accidents through the exams, but I still could pass the text.
My new school
My school is a key school with history of seventy years.
Many students graduated from it have been famous men [,8-0] .
y school is big and beautiful.

Most of them are [vp6,3-3] master [np6,6-2] of swimming.
How happily the were playing!
Among them there was a little girl, her mother was teaching her how to swim.
Seeing this scene, I remember that I used to swim in my childhood.
How wonderful the days are!
I have never swam [vp6,3-0] since I spent my holiday in Beijing ten years before [wd3,2-0] .
I think that June is the best [wd7,s-] moon [wd3,4-] in one year.
Because the weather is fine, and people can have so many sports outside .
One night, when Tim was sleeping in his bed, a fire near his house was broken [vp7,6-1] out.
He woke up quickly and telephoned [cc3,0-3] 119 for help.
Then he found his friends to go to the burning house [,10- 0] .
They tryed [fm2,-] their best to put out the fire.
Later the firefighter came.
They worked togeter [fm1,-] .
A moment later, the fire was put out.

Dear May: Thanks you for your letter.
I am sending you a few advice [np5,2-] about gardening.
First examine soil and ask your neighbours which plants grow best.
Sow seeds at the correct time of the year.
Don't grow plants in the same time year after year.
If you remove weeds before planting plants, the plants will grow taller.
Turn the soil over with a fork then sow seeds in the soil.
Then the plants will grow well.
Please write me soon.
Yours Li Baoling

Through the trains [wd3,-] , we can improve our English.
We will try our best at it.

Because I will attend the running of the 400 metres .
This is a trial.... later I have finished the running.
Though I am the last one .
I am very pleased with this match.
I try my best to do it.
Playing [vp2,-1] computer.
After a busy week, I can play [vp2,-2] my computer.
Sitting at the desk, I turn on my computer.
The [wd5,0-1] first, I check my computer and find it has not mater [fm1,-] .
Then, I enter the windows and play the games---chess.
My father likes it very much.
Because it an play with my father and it is more than the chess.
It also has the luchy [fm1,-] game and the End [cc1,-] Game, it's very funny.
I like it, too.
Finish [vp4,0-2] playing chess, I put a disk into the CD-ROM.
This disk is an encyclopaedia.
It can lead me to travel through the [wd5,1-1] China.
It is a good "book".
At last, I listen [vp1,0-1] the music by the computer.
Computer is a good entertainment and tool.
Many people study it now.
My father also study [vp3,3-0] it .
I think that I must try my best and do it better.
Say Good-bye to the practical teachers [cc4,2-0] .
Before six weeks [pp1,2-] , they just came to our school.
Who are they?
they [fm3,-] are the practical teachers [cc4,2-0] .
They are from the [wd5,0-8] Guangdong teachers [fm3,-] training [fm3,-] college fm3,-] .
They taught us Chinese.
During this period, they tried their best to teach us well, they are very conscientious, and they are our teachers, they are also our friends.
They often talk with us after class and often help us to do everything in class.
Now, their practice [cc2,1-2] has finished, they will be away.
We have [cc3,-2] the party with them to see them off.
At last, we give a present to each of them and they also give us a good persent [fm1,-] --- a football.
We are so happy, but we are unhappy too, we wish the practical [cc4,1-1] teachers have a good coming [wd3,-] .
How to learn English.
This Saturday afternoon some people who are from the Hot Youth Corporation came to our school.
They taught us how to learn English.
We are all interested in it.
They said that it is [vp6,4-4] important to speak English.
For Chinese people, spoken English is the most difficult, but is is also important.
They also said: "when [fm3,-] we speak English, we must speak it loudly, clearly and quickly.
I think it is right.
Before [wd3,-] , I considered written English is [vp6,4-0] more important than spoken English.
I don't like to speak English from time to time.
Now I begin to know that is wrong.
So I will stick to speak [vp5,4-4] English loudly very day.
I think I can do it well.
Have a trip.
Today is Nov.23.
We are together have a trip [,5-0] .
We go to HSCHIAD HILL.
We are all happy and excited.
 [wd4,0-2] Sky is blue , he sun is shining, the water in the lake runs loudly.
First, we came to the Tian Lake.
There, we watch [vp6,2-2] the acrobatics.
It is say [vp7,2-7] wonderful that we looked with fixed eyes .
Later, we came to another places [np6,-] that we watch many scenes.
For example : the monument, the CUI ROCK, the Bai Yun Grotto.....
The time runs [cc2,2-2] very quickly.
At three in the afternoon, we left the HSICHIAO HILL for Guangzhou.
We are [vp6,1-5] unwilling to part with it, but today we are so happy.
Play a play.
On Friday, I take part in English extracurricular activities.
Afer [fm1,-] the aural comprehension .
We began to play a new play.
The play's title is "who is the [wd5,2-1] stronger " Miss Liu divided us four groups and let us act one character of the play.
I am in the Group 2, and I would act the "ice".
This play's main idea is: There is [vp3,1-5] ten characters in the play, the cat, the mice, the sun, [wd4,11-1] the wind.
They wore [fm1,-] quarrelling [vp1,4-4] who was the strongest.
At last, they all understood: "we all have our place, we all have our say.
" Tough [fm1,-] [cj1,0-2] this time, I didn't play this play.
But I also understand: We are [wd5,1-4] have the strong point and have the shortcoming too.
If we face the strong point and the shortcoming correctly .
We are the strongest people in the world.
The professor and his invention
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the government.
Because Professor Hunter was not strong enough to go o London, her daughter didn't let him go to London himself.
So the goremment [fm1,-] was going to sent two men to take his papers.
They could come [wd4,0-3] eleven this morning.
But at ten thirty, two man [np6,1-0] came [wd4,2-0] his house to get the papers.
They were Dr. Brown and Mr. Rose.
They were impostors.
They seemed to be nervous and were to anxious to get the papers, so professor didn't trust them.
He gave them some other papers.
After two men got away, the Sergent [fm1,-] Bull and Inspector White arrived [vp1,2-2] professor's house.
They asked [wd3,1-9] them that the two men weren't the right men.
But professor asked them not to worry bout his invention.
The papers which two men had taken were not the real ones.
At last, professor [fm3,-] Hunter decided to take the papers to London himself.
I love Beijing.
In 1993, my parents and I went to Beijing.
When I got to Beijing, I love this city at once.
Because it is an imporant [fm1,-] and beautiful city .
Beijing is the capital of China.
it [fm3,-] is the centre of politics, economy and culture.
Owing to the open-door policy of our country [wd2,7-0] .
Great changes have taken place since 1978.
Many buildings and houses have been put up.
In 1992, we held the Asian Games in Beijing.
Through this sports meeting, many countries made [cc3,-2] the friendship and exchanged each other.
Beijing is also a beautiful city.
There are many famous wonders and spots, such as the Great Wall, the Beihai Park, the Summer Palace, and so on.
We have travelled some to [wd7,4-1] them.
They are very beautiful.
I love Beijing and I hope that she will be made better and better.
My Future.
I am a [np7,0-2] ordinary girl.
But I decid [fm1,-] to be a teacher of meddle [fm1,-] school.
Tjhi [fm1,-] is my dream since I was a child.
Someone said, as a teacher, he must work with the student [np6,5-0] , it is very trouble.
But I don't think that [wd4,-] .
It is very insteresting [fm1,-] and happy to word [fm1,-] with the children , isn't it?
Now, there is [vp3,1-6] not many teachers in our country.
Many people didn't want to do a teacher.
Because they thought it is hard to do .
I think it is true.
But I am not afraid.
I can do [cc3,2-2] a teacher---- a good teacher in my future.
A good girl At the street corner, a group [wd4,1-2] young men were playing chess.
At that time, a blind man with a stick came towards them.
Being blind, he touched one of the young men on the foot.
The young man stood up with anger and shouted at the blind man.
Just then, a young girl came up.
She glared at the young man and took the blind man by the arm and led him across the street.
All the other young men stood up dumbfounded and look [vp6,6-3] at the girl.
This time, they all felt sorry.

Sunflowers
Have you ever seen sunflowers?
I'm sure you have.
They are growing here and there, before or behind houses, along roads or around the fields.
A sunflower looks like a tree.
But it's a kind of grass.
It comes up in Spring and has seeds in autumn.
Its flower smells wonderful and its seeds (we all say that it is [vp3,1-2] sunflower seeds) are nice to eat and can also be made into oil.
The most interesting thing about a flower is that it always faces the sun.
In the morning when the sun rise [vp3,3-0] , its face turns towards the east and in the afternoon towards the west still acing the sun.
when [fm3,-] I was a puiple [fm1,-] , my classmate and I often plant [vp6,5-2] the sunflowers.

LETTER TO A PEN FRIEND June 1, 1997.
Xiao jun, Thank you for your letter.
I am sending you a few pieces of advice about gardening.
First, you must examine soil and see if it is good to grow vegetable.
And then, you ask your neighbours which plants grow best and when the correct time of year is to sow seed.
Second, make a plan for growing plants.
Don't grow plants in the same place year after year.
Third, remove weeds often and your plants will grow taller.
Fourth, turn the soil over with a fork e you sow seeds.
Well, I just know these.
I hope I can help you and you will plant the vegetable well.
Best wishes.

Dear Fanny; Thank you for your letter.
I am sending you a few pieces of advice about gardening.
First examine the soil in your garden.
If the condition of the soil is not good, you should improve it.
You can ask your neighbours how to do it.
Then sow seed in the soil at the correct time of year.
You should listen to the report or ask your neighbours about the weather, because it's important for you.
Don't grow the same plants in the same place year after year.
You can make a plan to change the crops in your fields.
Remove the weeds sometimes so that the plants will grow taller.
You can turn the soil over with a fork to destroy the weeds.
Well, I must stop now.
Best wishes.
Yours, Lu Shujuan.

Aswan Dam
Three of the biggest man-made projects in the world are the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt and the Aswan High Dam, which is also in Egypt.
The High Dam at Aswan was completed in 1970.
It was built for several reasons.
first [fm1,-] , the River Nile used to flood large areas at the same time every year and destroyed houses and crops.
The new dam controls the waters of the Nile so that they now run regularly all through the year.
Second, electricity can now be made from the water which rushes through the base of the dam.
Now about 20-50Egypt needs is produced from this dam.
The dam which is the biggest in the world, is 3,830 metres long.
It is 980 metres wide at the base and 40 metres wide at the top.
The lake that has been made by the dam is about 500 kilometres long.
Before they began to build the dam, people already knew that there were going to be several problems.
As a result of the dam, the water level of the lake was going to rise by 63 metres.
It would be necessary to move 53,000 people from their villages.
Also around the area of Aswan there are a lot of important old temples, which date [vp6,1-5] from about 1250 B.C.
these temples were in danger.
When the dam was finished, many of them would be covered by the waters of the new lake.
One of the most important temples in danger was the one at Abu Sibel.
It was carved in the rock and had on the outside four large stone figures, each of which as 20 metres high.
Engineers studied the problem and suggested several different plans for rescuing the temple.

Something about the Lesson " All these things are to be answer [vp7,6-1] for" This week, we have learned the new lesson already.
When I read the wholely [fm1,-] story, I didn't think so the matter the boy and his sister had done [,12-0] .
I thought if I was that beautiful girl or the little boy.
I didn't do that.
If I was the girl, I will [vp6,6-6] pretend to marry [vp1,0-3] to the nobleman.
And after I became the nobleman's wife, he mustn't take precautions [np1,0-1] me.
So I will find a chance go give some poison in their food [,12-0] .
When the nobleman died, I am to burn their house and farm.
After I have done [vp1,3-0] , I died by myself.
If I was the boy, I didn't force the nobleman to draw upon me [wd7,13-0] .
On the contory [fm1,-] , I will make friends with that nobleman, and I will find a chance to take my sister leave the noleman's house.
But nothing else, the two noblemen were dreadful.
They must answer for they had done to the boy and his sister [,12-0] .
I showed sympathy for the boy and his sister.
The National Day
October the first is our country's Birthday.

On every street, the shop [np6,1-8] , the factory [np6,1-6] had put [vp6,8-8] up the national flag [np6,2-4] for a few days.

It was very possible for us to study English.

I thought that would be interesting [aj4,5-2] in it.
I hoped I would have a good result in the Middle Exam.
The sport which I like best.
Sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting fat, and keep us healthy, and give us valuable practice in helping the eyes, brain, and muscles to work together.
So we like the sports very much.

HAPPY New Year Miss Lin Gillian
Greatest Changes
This Monday, when we got to our school classroom.
we saw the classroom had great [wd2,1-1] changed.
There are many white boards.
Instead of the old blackboard .
Because the new while [fm1,-1] board is in great use for the teacher .
They don't breathe he ash of chalk.
This will help their health.
But this is the new thing.
We don't be used [aj2,-1] of looking [vp1,-1] this.
I think after serval [fm1,-] days, we will write the [wd4,3-5] white board in large letters.
I like my school
My school, Guang zhou the No.4 Middle School, lies in the west of Guang zhou City with a history of seventy years.
There are a classroom buildings [np6,2-0] , a lot of lab building [np6,4-0] and a library in it.
e have thirty classes of six different grades.
There are over wo hundred teachers and over two thousand students in my school.
The school offers twelve courses, including chinese [fm3,-] , English, mathenatics [fm1,-] , physics, chemistry, biology, politics, music, art, P.E., computer, and English typing.
It's nice school [np6,2-0] and we all love it.
Change
Our family lived in Guang zhou for many years.
And for many years, Guang zhou was a good place to live.
The streets were clean.
The parks were safe.
The people were friendly.
But Guang Zhou changed.
Today the streets aren't clean.
The parks aren't safe.
The population is increasing.
he reason which made his change is the other provinces people.
hey though [fm1,-] Guang zhou is a very good place to make money.
So lots of them came to Guang zhou to work.
The increasing population made [cc5,-2] rubbish increase.
Because not all of them can be invited, so some people go to steal or rob.
This made Guang zhou not safe.
I think they are too disgusting to stay here.
The Importance.
Last night, I had [vp6,3-3] seen [wd3,4-2] the newspaper.
From the newspaper, I knew that the NMET will be have listening text in next year.
And the important is must add the result of listening text up to the NMET [,14-0] .
So we must pay attention to training our listening.
When I heard this news, I began to decide a plan to train the listening.That is I will listen to the radio when I get up from go to school [,7-0] .
During this period, I will listen [vp2,0-4] the type [wd3,6-3] of the lesson.
I think it is useful for me to improve the listening.
Miss Lin, can you give good iders [fm1,-] to improve my listening except this?
I think you will give me some advice, will you?
Thank you!
Miss White: Good morning!

My New School
My school is a key school.
It is seventy years old.
Many students who were gratuated [fm1,-] [wd4,4-4] have been famous people.
My school has 36 classes now.
And there are 200 teachers in it.
y school is very big and beautiful.
Some trees stand around the chool building.
It has two school buildings and one lab and a big playground.
The playground, which we often play on it [wd5,7-0] , and have many exercises.
The teacher teach [vp3,2-1] well.
they [fm3,-] are strict with us.
They have rich experiences, we all show respect to them.
My hometown My hometown lies in the south of Yang dong Couty [fm1,-] .
It stands beside the low green hills.
It has more than 90 families.
There is about 500 people.
Great changes have taken place in my hometown these years.
Some new houses and new schools have been build [vp7,3-0] .
An food processing factory has been set up in the west of it.
The crop have [vp3,2-2] been good.
so [fm3,-] the agricultural production is going high.
Some peasants buy the motorbikes.
They are becoming richer and richer.
My home town is very beautiful and the people in it were [vp6,11-2] very kind.
So I love my home town very much.
June 14th.
Sunday  sunny.
This afternoon is very hot.
The temprature [fm1,-] is about 30c.
I think this time is good for swimming.
I see some children swimming in a river.
Some of them are good players.
In the middle of the river, a little girl is learning swimming.
Her mother teaches her how to swim.
When I see this scean [fm1,-] , I think about I often swim [vp6,5-3] in my childhood.
The last swimming was in Beijing in spending my holiday ten years ago.
I think June is the best month in one year.
I like June very much!
There is going to a lecture on June 4th.
That day is Wednesday, and the lecture will begin at two o'clock.
It will be lasted [vp7,3-2] two hours.
The lecture will be held on the big playground.
The lecture is given by Professor Wilson.
He is an English teacher of Hang zhou University.
he will speak on the difference between the British English and American English.
Please come on time.
And when the lecture over , you can come back your class and have a discussion.
That's all.
Thank you.
The world is strange and unfair.
Women can be elected beauty, but men havn't.
Every woman wishes to be beautiful.
So they join every select beauty match [cc1,2-] .
If she wins he match, she will cry out : "oh [fm3,-] !
I get it!
I get it!
" From then n, her life will be changed.
Because she has "changed" into a beauty .
Though men have strong muscles, handsome looking, ense [fm1,-] of humor and learned brain, they have to be audiences.
And because of these, they couldn't "change" their lives.
And this is why men must work hard at their works [np5, 2-0] .
Aha!
Sex!
help [fm3,-] each other
We are very lucky.
Because we have completed body .
Somebody will think it usual: every one has a completed body, nothing strange.
But the deformity hope to have completed body very much.
They have each drawback.
They would be lame, blind, deaf or dumb.
Because of these, they havn't [fm1,-] the happness [fm1,-] like the ordinary persons.
On ordinary days, they have more difficulty than any other person when they do things.
They would be treated unfair without any season .
They are innocent.
No body wants to be a deforming person.
If a man have [vp3,3-1] hair, he won't want to be blunt [wd7, 12-0] .
We should help each other, especially to the deformity.
When they are in trouble, they want that anybody would help him.
If we help them at that time, they could feel warm in their hearts.
Let's help each other, [wd4,4-5] make the world full of warm.Boss Many people want to be a boss.
But after they become rich, they don't know how to act as a boss.
Here, let me teach them.
First, he must " throw away" their wifes [fm2,-] who help and stay with him when they [pr3,16-3] are in trouble.
So they can lead different woman back home very night.
Second, he must call for a taxi or buy a car when he goes out.
It is very "cheap" to ride a bus.
It coundn't [fm1,-] show that they are bosses.
Third, because of a boss, you must speak some English words in your talking.
At [pp2,-1] less, you must know "OK", "Yes", "No", "Very good" and so on to show your "knowledge".
Last, you must make some cards with your name.
when you see everyone, like beggar, neighbour, pedlar (D?).
So everyone will know you are a boss.
After this, you are really a boss.
Rain
The rain will never stop.
Raining, raining, raining, from morning to evening, from evening to morning, it still rains hard.
I don't know where the water comes from.
The ground always is wet.
If a little piece of ground is going to be dry, a heavy rain will make it wet again.
Because of rain, umbrella, shoes, rainboots [fm2,-] and rain coat can be seen everywhere.
The shop which sell them has [vp3,5-2] many [np8,0-1] business.
The shopkeeper is very happy for these.
Ah!
Raining, Raining, Raining again!
terrible [fm3,-] women
There are some women.
They haven't powerful mucle [fm1,-] , smooth teeth and lots of money.
But when men see them, men will turn soft like a sheep.
If the women call [wd3, 3-4] them to the west, men dare not go to the east; if the women all them to it, en dare not stand.
All the men's money must be handed to he women every month.
If the men want to use a fen, first he must make a report.
With the women's permitting, then hey can receive he money from the money and use it.
But it is interesting at the men like these are [wd5,9-3] always become rich after several years.
People name the women " tiger wife".
My New school My school is a key school which has a history of 0 [wd7,11-0] .
Its [np4,0-5] many graduates have become famous person [np6,4-0] .
Look!
There are thirty-six classes, 1800 students and more than 200 teachers.
Our school is large and beautiful with trees around it.
school has two teaching-building [np6,1-0] , a build [wd2,1-2] of experiment and a big play [cc4,-] ground.
Now, students are doing excesics [fm1,-] on the play ground.
Our teachers are excellent.
They are strict with students and the students respect their teachers.
I like this school.
Pencil-box.
I wanted to buy a pencil-box.
When I got to the shop, "oh [fm3,-] !
My God!
" most of the designs of the pencil-boxes were for girls.
A girl with long hair was playing with rabbit; Bon Bon Cat and so on .
Oh!
Who is Bon Bon Cat?
A cat can throw bombs and make a very loud noise "Bow"!
or a cat can eat bomb hen the bomb explodes in its belly (??).
Fortunately, I didn't buy the "Bon Bon Cat".
I bought a pencil-box------ "Con Con Monkey"!
June 14, 1997.
Saturday sunny
It is hot today.
In this afternoon, the temperature is nearly thirty centigrade.
There are about seven or eight children are swimming.
Many of them are ood t swimming.
A little girl is learning swimming, and her mother teaching her.
I remember that when I was a child [,7-0] .
I ofter [fm1,-] go [vp6,4-1] swimming.
My last swimming was about ten years ago when I was spending holiday in Beijing.
I think that June is one of the best month [np6,4-3] in a year.
Time.
Time pass [vp3,1-1] fast.
A week is over again in the nervous exams.
he final exam is coming nearer and nearer.
But I feel that I ill have many things to do.
Perhaps I am lazy.
It is because I haven't firmly grasped [cc3,3-2] the time.
I like thinking, illusion.
And this wasted me many [np8,3-1] time.
So, I have done less work.
The final exam is coming!
Work hard!
Beginning of the new term After a very short " inter holidays" which had only laten [fm1,-] for two weeks, having finished the homework which was so much that we must do it all through the holidays, we began to have the added classes [, 36-0] .
In fact it is as pressing as regular classes.
So our new term began.
And we became busy by then.
Only after few days, the homework that the teachers gave us became more and more.
The most serious one is Chinese.
We must finish almost twenty pages of an exercise book which was just handed out two days before.
In the second week, we had three exams.
This term seems to be a very busy term [wd6,8-0] .
Going bankrupt
It was [vp6,1-8] only two week [np6,1-0] since the new term began.
But we had paid [vp6,3-5] a large number [wd3,2-2] of money.
At first we must hand in the money for registring [fm1,-] .
In this term it raised [vp7,s-] to almost 00 an.
The notice said that it was because the price of paper had en risen [vp7,7-0] .
It also said that there was almost 100 yuan overspent.
How can the teachers take decisive action without asking for approval and only report it later as a fait [fm1,-] accompli [fm1,-] !
How can they use our money that haven't [vp3,7-3] been handed over!
It was said that the reward of the added classes would be collected fore [fm2,-] long.
It takes 80 yuan.
If it go [vp3,2-3] on like this, we will go bankrupt sooner or later.the [fm3,-] whiteboards Now the teachers in our school needn't be harm [vp7,1-] by the dust of the chalk any more.
It is because that the blackboards [fm1,-] in our school was changed to whiteboards last week.
The students sitting the front of the classroom benefit [fm1,-] from it too.
After the whiteboard was use [vp7,4-0] , the air became cleaner than before, but after used some times , the white board becomes dirty.And the white board is hard to be dry.
This prevent [vp3,1-5] us from writing on it.
This must be settled by the ones on duty by keeping the cloth dry.
Close the door
On [wd5,0-2] last Thursday, when we were having a chemistry class, dust [wd7,0-6] was burned on the play ground.
The smoke and the smell went upstairs and came into the classroom through the backdoor.
We were sitting near the back door.
The smell make [vp6,2-2] us uncomfortable.
So we closed the door to keep it out.
Soon after that, our head teacher, Miss Lin, came and asked us to open the door.
We told her about the bad smell.
But she insisted that we must open the door.
Then there came gust.
The smell of the lavatory was bring [vp7,-] to us.
As soon as we were going to close the door, Miss Lin came and prevented us again.
And we were scolded for it.
Running
This Thursday we were told that there would be running surrounding [wd3, 1- 4] the Jin hua street on [wd5,0-3] the ext day, so we had to come to school at 7:10.
In [wd3,0-2] Friday morning, it rained very hard.
I thought that the running must be given up, so I wnet [fm1,-] to school at the time we have [vp6, 8-6] the morning reading on ordinary days.
When I got to school, I saw many students of the No.11 middle school running along the road.
In the school, I was told that we had to run, even in rain.
After having run several hundred mertres , the rain became harder and harder, so that we can stop [vp6, 9-1] running.
Chess
Now we have little [np7,1-] thing of entertainment to do in our room.
It lies [wd3,-] in our head teacher.
In these days, we had been [vp6,5-4] forbidden to play football unless it was on [wd3,0-4] the phsiclal [fm1,-] training class, forbidden to play the Five Pieces Chess, even forbidden to play the Chinese Chess .
But soon we found another game to play.
It was the Flying Chess.
Though it seemed very silly, we thought it fairly interesting in the games we can [vp6,9-0] play.
Everyday, as soon as the class is over, serval [fm1,-] groups of classmates get together and play Flying [fm3,-] Chess [fm3,-] .
This make [vp3, 1-2] me think that the Flying [fm3,-] Chess [fm3,-] will be forbidden to play sooner or later.
Questions and answers
The year 1997 has come.
On July 1, Hong Kong will be returned.
It's great day for China, so we held a questions and answers match bout Hong Kong to celebrate .
The match was divided into two parts.
The first part was the problems essential to be answer [vp7,4-0] .
Every group must pick out five of the problems and answer it [pr3,8-0] .
at the beginning, the match was fair, but as time went on, some classmates began to shout and prevent the other groups from answering question.
The second part was the problems to try to be the first to answer [,13- 0] .
Because of the fourth group's cheating, they won at last .
Since it is just a game, why not play fairly and happily?
Too much homework April was going to end, and the examination of graduation was coming.
every [fm3,-] subject made full use of all the time to give classes and reveiv [fm1,-] .
All the things were carried on in a hurry.
Besides the curriculum's quickly going on, the homework was so much that it became terror.
Every day there would be some exercise papers handed out, such as Chinese, physece [fm1,-] , chemistry, English...., all the time had to be used to do the paper.
To finish all the homework and paper, we were made to be of great urgency.
Every day there was full of work around us.
How terrible it was!
In the chemistry lab.
Last week the [wd5,0-2] senior three were going to have the simulate examination.
Because there were too many students, the classrooms were not enough.
So the [wd5,0-2] senior two had to lend them the classrooms and moved to the lab to have classes.
Having classes in the chemistry lab was very unconvenient [fm2,-] .
It was trouble to get boiled water.
The lab was very far away from the mansion, so every morning we went to get boiled water group by group.
This would late to the morning reading [,6-0] .
It was very bad [wd3,-] for the teacher to get there to give us lessons.
They must [vp9,1-2] got down from the fifth floor long before the class began, and get back to the fifth floor after class.
The only conveniet [fm1,-] thing was to play balls.
When the class was over, many students would rush out and play basketball, football .... Nearly half of the play ground was occupied by us.
The experiment exams This Tuesday and wedesday [fm1,-] there will be experiment exams of physics, biology and chemistry one after another.
This took us into the tide of experiment [np6, 4-0] .
The physics lab and the biology lab opened for us to some practice [wd2,8-0] these days.
But there were so many students in the lab hat it became confusion.
This brough [fm1,-] us much diffculty [fm1,-] in doing experiment.
He [fm3,-] mot [fm1,-] trouble thing was to see the video recording of physics experiment.
It would be [vp6,2-5] showed [fm2,-] at [wd5,1-3] last Tuesday night.
his made the students didn't need to go to school at night stayed at school [,14- 0] .
But at that night, after waiting for more than half an hour in the basement, we were told that the videocorder [fm2,-] didn't work.
We had to see it on Friday afternoon.
Imminent as now, the teachers never let us be free.
They gave even more homework and exams.
How can we review well?
My new school
My school was [vp6,2-3] a key school with a history of seventy years.
Many students graduated from our school had been famous.
The school has thirty six [fm2,-] class [np6,2-0] .
Altogether, there are about one thousand and eight hundred students and more than two hundred teachers and workers.
Our school is large and beautiful.
Many green trees are planted around the school building.
In the school, there are two building [np6,1-0] for teaching, one building for experiment and a large play ground.
The students can have sports on the lay ground.
The teachers in our school are excellent.
They are very strict with the students.
and the student respect them.
Playing Basketball Since the basketball [cc1,1-1] court was built in our school, the tide of playing basketball came into being in our class.
Many classmates play basketball after school, at noon and in the evening.
Our head teacher, Miss Lin, forbids them to do that and stops them by all the ways.
But the tide last [vp3,3-4] to the night now.
On Tuesday night, six students of our class played basketball after the self-study at night.
When Miss Lin passed by and noticed it, the students dissipated at once.
But at last they were captured eventually.
Playing basketball is a good deed, but playing late into the night is too excessive.
June 14, 1997.
Sunny.
Today was very hot, the air temperature was nearly thirty [wd4,-] centigrade.
Walking near the river, I saw some children swimming in it.
most [fm3,-] of them swam well.
A little girl was studying [wd3, 0- 1] swimming, teached [fm2,-] by her mother.
The weather was so hot that every body wanted to have a swim.
I used to swim in my childhood.
About ten years ago, I had the last time of swimming while I was spending my holiday in Beijing.
Since then, I had never had [vp6,5-2] a swim.
I regarded June as one of the best month [np6,5-0] in a year.
The fourth week.
Time is leaving [cc2,2-1] quickly.
I have had English classes for four weeks.
Before this week, I was very afraid of you when you asked somebody to answer your questions.
Because my English is not so well [ad2,5-0] , speaking is worse than writing.
Then I thought: ther people will laugh at me when I give a wrong answer.
I will fell [fm1,-] sorry for this.
In this week, I found my classmates didn't laugh at me after you asked me.
I thought: in act, I am afraid of you for I doesn't [vp3,7-2] believe myself.
If I try my best, nobody laugh [vp3, 1-2] at me and they are friendly to me.
So I decide; I must study hard.
Don't let my teacher and parents desappoint [fm1,-] .
The fifth week.
Because National Day is coming, there are four days for rest.
What will to do in these days?
Except shopping, playing, watch TV, go over the homework .
Have any else [,2-0] ?
Yes, it is sports.I often didn't [vp6,2-12] get up until 10 o'clock when I needn't go to school ago.
One day my father talked with me about this matter.
Through father's words, I knowed [fm2,-] it wasted time for I got up late.
I must get up early and have [wd3,0-2] some sports.
It's helpful for [wd3,2-1] me.
Then I do so.
When I came into the stadium the first .
I thought it is [vp6,3-9] pleasant o breathe the fresh air in the morning.
There liked a beautiful picture.
There were green tree [np6,3-0] , green grassland, the orange sun, little birds and the happy people in it.
How good was the feeling!
Ever since then, I insist [vp6,-] to get up early and have [cc3,-] sports.
The six Week
A very unhappy thing was happened [vp7,5-3] in this week--- my little tortoise is dead.
I cried for it over a night.
Though he didn't come into my home so long, my family got on well with him.
We have been good friends.
I had had two tortoises before "my friend" died.
But perhaps they have made friends with Karl Marx.
Then I liked "my friend" than before because he was the last one and I very [ad2,1-9] regard that I hadn't taken good care of them.
So I tried my best to treasure him.
But I couldn't change the thing, the little tortoise [wd4,-] still as died .
I lost a good friend.
He leaves me for ever.
I couldn't excuse me.
But I hope dear tortoise can find his friends and become happiely [wd2,10-0] .

All the people of Guang zhou did some cleaning for it.
people [fm3,-] worked as one and tried hard to make Guang Zhou cleaning.
There were just two days for rest, my family began to do some cleaning.
I like health, but I don't like to clean.
I believe it is a hard work.
But when I saw my Dad and Mum worked [vp5,7-1] carefully, I couldn't free [cc3,2-2] my hands.
Then I did with them.My job was cleaning the windows.
When I was cleaning, Mum said to me: " Should we take a watch [wd7,-] for cleaning the windows quickly?
" " OK.
It's [pr2,0-4] sure I will win.

I tried to make the windows cleaning in a few times.
At last, the winner was Mum, but I was praised by them.Because the window of I cleaning were very bright .After that, I didn't hate do some cleaning any more.

Today is happy and exciting [cc4,4-0] .
When the sports meeting began, we had the ceremony of entering.

It was very intructive [fm1,-] for us.
The Ninth Week.
Miss Lin handed out the English test paper yesterday.
I got 71 marks.
Though I passed this test, I believed 71 marks was very bad.
This test was for Unit 2.
It only has two lessons' knowledge.
How a few contents !
But I only got 71 marks.
The examination will come soon.
In that time, how I can...if I can catch up with other classmates in a short time, I must study hard [ad3,s-] than before and give up bad habits.
What is [vp3,1-3] my bad habits?
It is slow to do things.
I often do things slowly than others .
Example: doing homework, doing housework, even clearing up my school-bad ...
This test paper was done so bad, the important reason was this.
I try to give up it [wd1,5-0] .
I must study hard.
No pains, no gains.
The Tenth Week.
My house has a " garden in the air".
There are many flowers in it.

I like them very much.
When you go into it in early morning, you will feel the air is very fresh.
After water the flowers, some drop of water slide follow the flowers [,11-0] .
In the sun, it looks like some crystals.
That is very beautiful.
In the autumn wind, leaves shake slightly.
And looks like to say " Good morning" to you [,8-0] .
When you breathe the fresh air look at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy is it [wd1,3-0] !The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me much [cc4,-] knowledge about plants.
Example : How to plant flowers?
How to manage them?
When do they bloom?
Why people say " last briefly" ?...
And it tells me the important thing is not to pluck flowers and take good care of them.
The Twelfth Week.
In this week, I became a farmer from a student.
The feeling was very interesting and intructive [cc4,6-0] .
I was happy and worried before we set out.
Happy, because we have just taken the exam, now we can loose .
Worried, because the military training was very tired, I afraid of this as tired as the military training [,17-0] .
When we reached the base, and began to work, I found to become a farmer was tired [aj4,7-0] .
But there was happy in it [,5-0] .
I worked with the classmates, we sang together, smiled together, all the unhappy thinks were forgeten.
Through this farmer's work, I learned [cc3,0-4] a lot of knowledge.
I think I can't forget it in my life.
The Thirteenth Week.
On Friday afternoon, our class had a meeting for choose [vp5, 6-4] the monitor and cadres.
It was the first time since we came to this class.
So we were so glad.
Because this meeting was a democratic work-style .
It can be shown [vp7,3-2] our ideas.
We can choose the monitor and cadres who we all like the [wd5,8-1] best.
It can be given [vp7,3-6] all the classmates a fair chance.
Because our eyes were clear .
If you do the work very good and really put the heart into how to help classmates .
We can see.
Everyone can prove oneself and find one's shortcoming at the same time.The result was shown.
It proved our ideas was very right.
My good friend Xuan Yunsheng had the most ballots.
All the people believed her [pr4,4-4] can accept this work.
She was very happy.I was verry [fm1,-] happy for her, too.
I must learn from her.
The Fourteenth Week.
We went to Pei lei cinema and saw the film on Saturday this week.
I believed it was very bored [aj4,5-4] before I saw it.
But my idea was wrong completely.
The film was exciting and moving and angering [fm1,-] .
When I saw the Chinese severely scolded [vp5,6-2] the Japanese, I was exciting [aj4,2-0] ;when I saw : the Chinese common people left their home and become [vp6,8-2] a fugitive; the children left their parents, no food, no clothes, cried on the street; the old person saw their lands became ruins and cried bitterly, I was very moving [aj4,3-0] .
When I saw : the Japanese named himself " the king of the Heaven", they made trouble out of nothing, tried to agression [wd2,-] China and impudented [wd2,-] to make China pay for the war reparations, I angered [wd2,-] very much.
Though Japanese likes strongly,Chinese are never afraid of them.
In the end, we united and be [vp4,-1] winner.
As a Chinese, I must remember July 7th , 1937, must remember the Chinese history.
I must place the interest [np6,4-6] of the country above everything else.
The Fifteenth Week.
I took part in the team of geography in the seventh and eighth lessons on Friday this week.
It was very interesting.
I wasn't interested in geography all along.
Then the base [wd3,2-3] is very bad.
In the junior middle school, I was absent-minded to have the lessons of geography [,15-0] .
At that time, geography wasn't diffucult, I depended on my memory to have [vp1,-1] tests.
And often passed them [, 3-0] .
But in the senior middle school now, understanding is very important to learn geography, so I want to get good grades is impossible [,22-0] .
So such were the facts, I believed I can't change it.
I known [fm2,-] my base [wd3,5-2] was bad, this was fact.
But since I took part in the team of geography, I came to be interested in geography.
It told me a lot of knowledge about the earth and something in the earth.
Some think looks like very strange ago, but now it made me understand the fact and the truth.
Now I believe it isn't very difficult be [vp5,7-3] learn geography better.
The Eighteenth Week.
The Emperor's new clothes Long long [wd6,-] age there loved [wd3,4-2] an emperor, he cared more for the beautiful clothes thatn [fm1,-] for anything else.
The cheat knew the emperor liked fine few clothes, then they came to tell the emperor that they were the best weaver [np6,4-0] and they can weave [vp6,2-17] a kind of cloth which the people of stupid or unfit for their office could not see.
The foolish emperor believed them easily and gave them some gold to let them weave the cloth for him.
The two cheats set up two looms and pretended to work day and night.
After some time, the emperor sent his old Prime Minister to see how the cheats were getting along with his cloth.The old Prime Minister went to see and could not see anything.
But he didn't want to let anyone know he was unfit for his office.
Then he told the emperor the cloth was very wonderful.
Before long the emperor sent another official to see the cloth again.
The official could not see anything, but his anwer [fm1,-] was as same as the Prime Minister .
The emperor was very pleased when he heard the official's words.
So he decided to have new clothes make of the splendid cloth for the procession.
The procession began.
The emperor walked in the street and have [vp6,7-3] the "new clothes".
Many people pretend [vp6,2-4] to see the clothes, but suddenly a little child said: " He has nothing on!
" His words was whispered from one to the other.
At last, the braver people cried they couldn't see anything at all on the emperor.
The Emperor heard the cries and he knew that the people's words were true, but he went on the procession to keep [wd3,1-2] his face.
The Nineteenth Week.
In this week, all the items of our chool's art programme have passed the first try.
My class there were a lot of programmes have entered the last match.
And some programmes of our class have won the prize.
Example: we won [wd4,1-1] first place on the programme of flowers.
And we won the third place on the programme of the handicrafts.
These was a [np7,0-2] exciting news for us.
It also greatly encourage [vp3,3-1] us.
Through our school's art programme, we can see everyone loves our class, and school very much.
They aren't only speaking but also doing.
They took an active part in this art programme.
They didn't mine [fm1,-] if they couldn't win the prize.
The important thing was they could try their best for class.
Then everyone rehearsed again and again, no one mined [fm1,-] tired and hard.
Such is our class, it is making progress.
The Nineteenth Week We took part in our school's art programme in the Peilei theatre today.
We shared in the pleasure of it.
as a NO.4 Middle School's student, we were proud of our art programme had so high level [,17-0] .
But all the thinks [wd2,-] could not leave [cc2,6-9] teachers and students' hard exercise and the others' support.
Example: In my class, Ao Jingya, Tao Xin, Chen Xiaocong, Ye Jiaqing, Li Yongming and Lui Siming made sixty-one card [np6,1-0] on which there were-and [wd7, 10-0] ---.
In order that our class could make a good atmosphere .They went on doing this work until 10 clock last night.
Today on the art programme, when Liang Shaoying was singing, all the class Two's students put up our these --- and ---, and shaked [fm2,-] them [wd7,24-0] .
At this time, we moved [vp7,4-1] deeply, I thought Liang Shao ying was, too.
This was the most support for her, and she must be encouraged greatly.
I deeply wish our school's art programme will be made better and better, because it has many people's support.
The Twentieth Week
My mother is a common woman, she has the Chinese women's nature: kind, good nature, honest, hard working and thrifty.
And she is impatient, then she hates [cc3,-1] slow very much, and she does what she ays at once.
It sure that is not a shortcoming but I believe it is a big shortcoming.
Because I often do things slowly .
I am different [aj2,-1] for her, no ways, I am often taught by her.
She grow [vp3,1-3] old and querulous.
Then my ear is worse .
Example: Sometimes I got up late, she must [vp9,1-3] :" Dan, be [cc5,1-1] quickly!
be [cc5,0-1] quickly!
now [fm3,-] is 7:30!
" " ah [fm3,-] ,7:30?
God save me!
" I think aloud and get up at once.
When I look at the watch, it shows 6:40.
OH!
My mum!
When I dress, her voice is said again: " Dan, be [cc5,0-1] quickly!
It's so late.
You will [vp9,1-3] late for school if you don't hurry.
Do you dress ok?
" " ok [fm3,-] !
I'll be all right.
" Two minutes passed, she says again: " The breakfast will be cold.
Quickly!
" ...
This is my mum.
though [fm3,-] she sometimes so trouble , but [wd5,9-8] I know she loves me, loves our family.
So I love her, she is a very good mother for me.
The Twentieth Week The End of The Emperor's New Clothes In my hildhood, I have read [vp6,5-2] this story.
Though many years have passed, I still remember the story.
But my idea for [wd3,-] it is different [wd4,-2] that time.
When I was only a little girl, I ought the honest boy was very kind, and he was as young as me, so I very [ad2,1-2] liked himm [fm1,-] I believed the emperor went back his palace,he knew himself was worng and regreted m2,-] .
So he gave his place to the little boy and the boy became a good emperor.
This was my beautiful hope for this story in my childhood.
Now I became a student.
I see and study the ings more than before.
So my idea for this story has been changed [vp7,7-0] .
Now I believe the emperor wanted to keep [cc3,1-2] his face and held his head higher, then he couldn't see the road.
At last he didn't care and fell down.
Because he had nothing on really, so [wd5,6-5] the stone cut his skin.
Sham was punish him [vp7,2-] .
Though he tried his est to keep [cc3,1-2] his face, but [wd5,9-4] at last he couldn't.
perhaps [fm1,-] after many years, my idea will change.
But I still believe the emperor was wrong.
Because the story ells us: Fact must hit down sham [fm1,-] .
The New Term
The First Week.
On Saturday, I went to my grandmother's home after the school was over.
When I got there, I saw my little sister whom I haven't seen [vp6,8-3] so long time [pp2,2-] .
She is only two.
How [wd3,0-5] a little and lively girl!
I like her very much.
When I saw her to play [vp5, 5-2] a toy, I thought [vp2,1-5] my childhood, and my toys.
Though I didn't have so many at that time, I still played so happy [wd2,4-0] .
And I often played games with my good friends.
At that time, I usually stayed at home with Dad and Mum in the evening that I couldn't play with [wd4,-] friends.
So I like the night of power cut [wd3,7-0] .
In this evening, I could leave my home to play the game of "1/2??2?
" and "TT1/4"... How [wd3,0-3] a happy night!
I needn't [vp9,1-1] worried, needn't do home work ... Now, my childhood was [vp7,2-1] passed.
What is near me is not the toys, but the books and the school bag .
I doesn't like [vp3,2-0] the night of power cut [wd7,9-0] , because I must go over the homework.My little friends are the same as me, they must study.
.. but I doesn't [vp3,1-2] feel unhappy.
My parents work hard for me, they give me many things, including my happy childhood, without them I have nothing.
But [wd3,0-11] a person in the world, he can't always take from others, he ought to give to others and his country.
If I do it, I must study hard now, though I can't play as before, I still happy [,2-0] , because I study for my duty.
The Second Week
Xuan Yun sheng and me is [vp3,5-5] a pair of good friends.
We have got to know for seven years.
Though some years were [vp7,3-1] passed, our friendship didn't change.
The feeling what [pr5,2-8] she gives me is very kind [cc4,8-] and clever.
She has a pair of big eyes, and a big and high nose.
She tells me her nose likes her Dad [wd7,7-0] .
Her hair is often plaited on the [wd4,-] , I believe this fits her.
She isn't very beautiful, but is very little.
I often smile and say to her: " Brother, (We call each other: Brother) your face is young for ever, it doesn't grow old.
" Xuan Yun sheng likes smiling, sports, reading, listening to the songs, watching TV, sleeping (she often say [vp3,2-2] to me: " Brother, I really want to go to bed!
") and ... and helping others.
She is a good monitor in our class, and she is a good friend to me.
I will care [vp1,2-1] her and study her.
The Third Week What matter is paid attention to the most recently is President is elected in Taiwan [,14-0] .
The result of electing is Li Denghui of the Nation Party winning.
Through [fm1,-] I'm a student, I still know Li Denghui is a schemer.
He wants to prove that he gets wide support through this electing, then he can make China has no way for him and he will be free to keep TaiWan as a country.
But he is wrong.
Out country even doesn't afraid of America and Japan, of course, we don't afraid of him [,15-0] .
China won't change the Chinese people's hope.
If we are right, we don't change our idea forever.
Tai Wang is China's territory, Li Denghui doesn't obey this fact, even begs America and Japan to help him.
This likes a man begs others to hit his brother [,9-0] .
What a cheap man!
I have still remebered: Four years ago, when Li Denghui was elected President the first, he told all the people that he would try to help to unite China and Tai Wan [fm2,-] .
But now, his deeds is different,what he have [vp3,2-3] ever said "completely, What a big lie!
" through [fm1-] Li Deng hui is elected President, the fact hasn't changed, China must be unite!
The Footh [fm1,-] Week
I became to like to kick the huttlecock recently.
In fact, I had [vp6,3-7] liked it when I was a pupil.At that time, I often played with my classmates, and even with mum.
I have taken [vp6,2-10] part in the match of kicking shuttlecock in my school.
When I went into the middle school, the studing [fm1,-] was ore difficult than before, and the homework was more and more.
f I was free, I would rather watch TV, Because I usually have a little spare time to watch TV .
Then after a long ime, I didn't grasp how to kick the shuttlecock [cc6,-1] nearly.
But when I studied in the senior school, I found the boys of my class are [vp6,7-4] good at icking shuttlecock.
When I see they kick so happy [wd2,6-0] , I can't help rying.
So I buy a shuttlecock and kick with the girls.
The girls in my class look like shy very much, but when they are playing, they won't shy [wd1,2-0] .
They told my that they liked to kick shuttlecock as me before.
Kick [vp4,0-10] shuttlecock after the class was ver is a good thing.
It can make us happy and light, and it is helpful for our riendship.I like it very much.
The Sixth Week.
The League members in our grade will go to?1 omorrow.
I want to make a paper flower this night, it is for expressing the words of my heart.
When I make it, I think the struggle of Guang Zhou [fm2,-] on 12.
11.
1927.
A lot of soldiers lost their lives for our country and people on that day.how [fm3,-] great they are!
Now the??
?
?is very wide and beautiful.
But it is the place where struggled sharply sixty-nine years ago.
There were many soldiers lost their lives at there.
The earth was dyed red by the soldiers blood.
As the person of Guang Zhou [fm2,-] , I must remember this history.Our happy living is changed by the great soldiers' flesh and blood.
Without them we have nothing.
So we can't take the good conditions for granted.
We must care our happy living [wd3,-] .
The paper flower is finished, I will put it in front of the "?
?1" and wish the soldiers who were buried were silent to " sleep" forever.
The Seventh Week.
The Footprint One day, Robinson Crusoe walked along the sands towards his boat.
On the way, he saw the mark of a man's foot.
'Is it a savage?
' Crusoe thought.
He was terrified by the footmark.
And so he hurried home---the cave.
When he thought [vp2,2-2] the footmark, he was afraid to go out, even for food.
He stayed in his cave for some days, but no savages came, and he became to feel more lonely without friends, because his dog was dead.
So he decided to go back and look if the footmark was made by himself.
But the foot print wasn't his.
So there must be somebody else on the island.
Then he decided to look for a cave where he could hide if savages came.
When he found a good place and stepped into it, suddenly he saw two eyes glaring at him.
He hurried out to hit a strick [fm1,-] .
Now he stepped back into the cave and found it was an old sick goat.
One morning, Crusoe found nine savages on the shore, they sat round a fire and ate something.
After they went by two canoes, Crusoe found the bones which the savages ate were a man's.
Then Crusoe made up his mind to shout [wd3,-] the savages if they came again.
The Tenth Week
My house has a " garden in the air".
There are any flowers in it.
they [fm3,-] are planted by my dad.
I like them very much.
When you go into in [wd4,1-1] early morning, you will feel the air is very fresh.
After watering the flowers , some drops of water slide follow the flowers [, 7-0] .
In the sun, it looks like some crystals.
That is beautiful [cc6,-2] very much.
In the wind, leaves shake slightly.
And looks like to say "Good morning" to you.
When you breathe the flesh air, look at the plants and do some sports in the morning, how happy it [pr3,19-1] is!
The "garden in the air" gives me much interest and tells me much knowledge about plants.
Example: How to plant flowers?
How to manage them?
When do they bloom ... And it tells me the important thing is not to pluck flowers and take good care of them.
The Fourteenth Week
THE STORY OF WELLIAM TELL.
Many years ago, Switzerland was ruled by Austria.
The hunter William Tell was same the other Swiss, not taking his fate lying down.
One day, William Tell came to Altorf with his son.
He saw that a pole was placed in the marketplace.
He knew what had happened: The governor who was sent by the emperor of Austria, placed his hat on the pole and ordered the Altorfers to bow before it.
but [fm3,-] William Tell walked past the pole without bowing.
So his son and he were caught [wd3,2-3] to the governor Gessler.
Gessler thought out a cruel plan in order to punish them.
He ordered Tell shoot [vp5,3-2] at the apple which was on his son's head.
Without saying a word, William Tell drew two arrows and splited [fm2,-] the apple in half with one arrow.
How brave!
And his son was brave, too.
If the arrow shoot [vp8, 3-5] at him,he wouldn't bow.
Facing the emperor, William Tell and his son were calm and brave.Their courage [cc2,1-5] quickly got round througout Switzerland.
The Swiss were [vp7,2-1] encourage, they rose up and forced the Austrain soldiers to go from Switzerland.
My First Teacher.
My first teacher, who taught me in the Primary school .
We called her Miss Le.
Though she was the "first", I almost forgot her.
Because she didn't teach me so long and she was a very common teacher .
It said [vp7,1-7] that she went to foreign country later, so I haven't seen her for a long time.
I only remember a little thing about her: She was thirty-five years at that time.
She was from the north of China, but she could speak the language of Guang Zhou [cc6,-2] very much.
She taught Chinese, and the classes which she gave [cc3,4-3] were not interesting.
But I still remember a small thing about us clearly; one day, Miss Le checked our homework.
I didn't finish for playing.
At that time, I was in Grade One, still a little child.
But Miss Le didn't think about this.
Then she let me stay in classroom after school over [wd5, 2-0] .
I cried, but I must obey her.
After I did the homework for ten times, she let me go home.
I was first punish [vp7,3-0] , I will remember forever.
Because it made me know: I wasn't a little child, I was a pupil, I must study hard .
I can't forget this thing, so I didn't forget my first teacher completely.
One Morning
In The Summer Holiday.
One morning in the summer holiday, I woke up early.
But the sun has rised [fm2,-] up.
My bedroom became bright.
I didn't went [vp6,2-0] to sleep again.
Then I got up and go [vp6,5-4] out of the balcony.
The balcony was covered by the sunlight.
The morning sunlight made me feel comfortable.
In front of the building which I live [wd4,7-4] is a big tree.
I thought that many little birds in it.
though [fm3,-] I didn't see one, I heard the voice that the birds was singing [cc3,8-0] .
Their voice was not so good, but this was happy for me.
The wind blowed [fm2,-] at me, oh!
So cool !
Perhaps only in the morning, summer doesn't make us feel hot.
Because I usually go to school, so [wd5,6-7] I seldom feel such a good morning.
Then I must thank [vp1,2-4] for the summer holiday!
The sun rise [vp3,2-4] up higher and higher.
The street was [wd5,1-2] became busy.
Many people went to work in a hurry.
Morning is a new beginning.
Though I am in summer holiday, shouldn't I miss a new start?
OH!
A new start----Let us care [wd3,-] it together!
My Grandpa.
My grandpa is eight [wd3,2-3] three years old.
He is thin [cc6,-2] very much.
But his health is good.
because he gets up and does morning exercises at five o'clock every morning .Though he is old, his mind is still clear.
If someone don't [vp3,2-4] know my grandpa's ge, they [pr3,8-9] can't guess that he is such an old man.
My grandpa often smile [vp3,3-0] , especially when we go to see him.
He likes reading.
He often tells me some great men, the custom of some places and the [wd5,1-3] other interesting things.
Sometimes he tells me his past to teach me the truth of living.
My grandpa care [vp2,2-4] my studying very much.
But he seldom asks me the mark of the exam.
He said to me: " The important thing is that you really grasp [cc3,2-2] the knowledge.
" So he not only gives me some advice about how to treat (?
?y) the studying correctly, but also collects some articles about the ways of studying to me.In fact,my grandpa is only a common old man.
But he is my mum's daddy and he is kind to me.
So in my heart, he isn't a common man.
Ideal
Ideal, perhaps everyone has one.
Because it is important for everyone .
But when I was in my childhood, I wasn't clear what was [wd1,4-2] my ideal.
In my heart, the good thing was too much [np8,4-0] , I didn't know what was the best.
when I saw a doctor, I thought that doctor could save many lives, so I wanted to be doctor [np6,4-0] .
When I saw the PLA man, I thought that he was so honour for defending our country, so I wanted to be.....
I seldom thought about the deal after I became a student.
But what I see and think is more than before.
Our society isn't perfect like my hope.
One day, I uddenly thought I must be a judge or a reporter.
As a judge, she can defend the fairness [wd3,-] .
As a reporter, she can report "the illness" of the society.
Perhaps this is my ideal.
But I really want to realize it.
Ideal mustn't be great [wd7,-] .
But it must be helpful for our society and people.
My ideal isn't great, but I still try to realize it.
THE NEW TERM THE THREETH WEEK
Today is my grandpa and grandma's birthday.
Their birthday is in [wd3,3-3] the same day.
my [fm3,-] grandpa is just elder [wd3,-] than my grandma for [pp1,-] ten years.
Today all my uncles, antys [fm1,-] , [wd4,7-5] cousins went to my grandpa's home.
They were happy, but the best [wd3,-] were my grandpa and my grandma.
Looking at the children of own [wd4,5-0] , weren't they happy?
I haven't seen them for some time because of the busy studying.
I felt sorry to [wd3,3-1] them.
They missed me very much, and often asked my mother how I live and study [vp6,8-0] .
Today, when I wanted to explain that I was very busy, they said to me: "Dan dan, to our joy the best, not you come to see us constantly, but you study hard and get a good school report.
" " I must do what you said.
" I answered with my heart, full of moving [wd3,-] .
Though my grandpa and grandma didn't have [cc3,2-4] a lot of knowledge, though they can't give me some advice on the studying,they have helped p6,21-0] me --- give me support.
Thank you very much, my grandpa and grandma.
I hope you get [wd3,3-3] a good health forever!
THE FOURTH WEEK
Because National Day is coming, I have a holiday for four days.
What will I do in these days?
I don't want to only [ad1,4-11] do the homework at home or go to bed all day, so I ceide [fm1,-] to do the sport in the morning.
This morning I went to stadium shich [fm1,-] is near my house with my friends in [wd3,0-2] 6:45.
Though it was early, many people have come [vp6,7-4] here to do exercise.
Look, a group of old women are dancing, fans in hand.
How young they are!
Look, on the grass there are some children of not more than ten , they are playing a plastics football.
How little they are!
Running [vp6,0-8] 800 metres, we played a game of badminton.
Perhaps we haven't played it for a long time, so we played it badly at first.
But after some time, we played so good [ad2,3-0] and we were exciting [aj4,2-2] very much.
An hour passed.
Tired as we were, we didn't ant to stop.
Why?
Perhaps because of the good weather, the green trees, the kind old women, the little children and the good holiday.
Perhaps we didn't for what , only for our happy feeling.A altogether, everything were [vp3,1-1] beautiful and everything make [vp3, 1-0] us happy.
What a happy [cc4,2-3] sport it was!
What a beautiful morning it was!
We love the sport, the morning and our living [wd3,8-0] .
THE FIFTH WEEK
There are lots of things which made me move in my living.
For example, my parents encourage me when I feel sad, my friends help me when I am in trouble, and so on.
though [fm3,-] the things are small, they can give strength to a person who is in trouble.
I still remember it happened in [pp1,-] last two years: One day I had a high fever suddenly [ad1,5-3] in the school.
I hadn't a little strength to do everything [pr6,7-0] , and I almost lay [wd3,2-1] down.
At that time, my good friend, a nice girl supported me and took me to a hospital.
She didn't leave until the doctor finished seeing me.
It was eight in the evening.
We have not had supper, and I felt terrible [vp6,8-0] .
When I wanted to cry, my friend said to me: " Insist on!
insist on !
let's go home.
" Looking at her, I knew that she was tried [vp7,2-2] very much, the same as me.
I was encouraged and I gathered the strength to walk...
Though it was a small thing or a short word, I must thank it for giving me strength.
THE SIXTH WEEK
Our school takes the sports meeting every year, have had it for several years .
But every time there was something that made me moving.
In this week, all the students of our class were busy for [wd3,8-4] preparing the sports meeting.
Who were busy the most were the seventeen boys and girls [,10-0] .
They epresented [fm1,-] our class to 3?3?.
This was a good chance.
These girls and boys took care [cc3,-] 3of this chance very much.
We could see: In the class of P.E.
after the school over [wd5,3-0] , in the evening studing of our own, they practiced [wd2,1-3] on the playground.
And they buyed [fm2,-] the shirts themselves in order that they can wear [vp6,13-3] the same clothes to 3?3?.
Oh!
They tried their best for our class's success.
All the students of our class must thank [vp1, 7-2] of them.
THE SEVENTH WEEK
I read [vp6,1-7] a story about loving our homeland recently: During the course of the war of rising up [wd7,10-0] the Japanese.
Ji Hong chang (1/4ao* ) has been asked [vp6,5-3] to visit America by the1* * 3.
At that time, in West people's eyes, China was a bad race.
Then some chinese [fm3,-] felt themselves inferior (?
) because of this.
One day, Ji Hong chang went to a post office with his friend.
When the postmaster knew that they were chinese [fm3,-] ,he sneered: "China?
I don't know China.
Where is it?
Ha ha..." Ji Hong chang's friend felt him inferior and said to him: " Why did you said [vp6,3-4] you were a Chinese?
You should say you were a Japanese, then you can get the foreigner's respect.
" Hearing these words, Ji Hong chang turned red with anger at once.
He catched [fm2,-] his friend's shirt and shouted: " Don't you think it is a disgrace as a Chinese?
But I think it is a proud [wd2,5-7] that I am a Chinese.
I will not be a slave of foreigner forever!
" Soon he went home and took a piece of wood, and wrote some things on it: I am a Chinese.
Then he put it in front of his chest, and went to the street holding his head high.
THE EIGHTH WEEK
Today is Friday.
It is the same as usual days: We must go to school.
But our new teachers will leave us today.
Our two new teachers are so young, and they are nice [cc6,-2] very much.
Though they stayed with us only three weeks, they have made friends with us.
They are Chinese teachers.
But they taught not only Chinese but also the truth about living to us.
They are good teachers.
The lessons which they taught were interesting and we were interested especially.
After the class, they played with us.
We regarded them as our friends.
Today they will leave us.
I can't write my words to express my idea.
But I know: though we maybe [ad1,1-5] will not meet each other, I will remember them and the time that we stayed [wd3,8-2] together forever.
THE NENETH WEEK
"Hello, It's Huang Xiao dan.
Who is that?
" "Hello, It's Xuan Yun shen.
" "What's the matter?
" I asked.
"Oh, no matter.
I only want to talk with you.
Are you free now?
" Xuan Yun sheng said.
" I'm doing homework now.
But since you want to talk with me, then I give some face to you .
" I answered.
"That's great.
I went shopping with my mum last night.
We saw two men fright [wd3,4-0] .
Can you guess what have happened?
" she asked.
"A thief stole the eople's wallet?
" I guessed.
"Oh, no.
The reason why they fought was a man knocked [vp2,2-3] the other's shoulder.
only [fm3,-] for this, they quarreled at first, then they didn't give in, at last they fought.
" She said.
"Oh, ..." I wondered : Weren't the two men fools?
In Guang Zhou, which is a beautiful and modern city, there are some people such as these, they really made us disappointed very much.
THE ELEVENTH WEEK.
I like sports, all kinds of sports are insteresting [fm1,-] to me.
But it is swimming and table tennis that I like the best.
In summer, when I jump into a pool, I feel very cool and happy.
his is one of the reasons which [pr5,6-3] I like swimming.
The other is that my mum told me swimming can [vp6,6-5] make us stronger and taller.
Swimming not only makes us happy but also does good to our bodies.
Can't I like it?
 [vp9,3-] I not only like to play table tennis but also watch table tennis match.
Table tennis match is very exciting.
It gives me [cc3,-1] relaxation.
When I watch a table tennis match, I feel proud.
Because the Chinese sports often win the match .
I like Wang Tao and Deng Ya ping very much.
I like the [wd5,2-2] other sports, for example: basketball, football, volleyball and o on, they all can keep us healthy.
THE TWELFTH WEEK.
The teacher of biology told us: If we felt bad, we should do the other things, in order that we could forget the unhappy things.
I agree [vp2,1-2] her words.
Because I often do so .
When I am unhappy, I will choose sleeping first.
And eating is a good was [wd7,5-3] for me, too.
Because I needn't think of anything in sleeping .
After sleeping , though I can't forget all things, my feeling becomes quietly, my train of thought become clear.
At that time I can know what has happened and what I should do.
This was [vp6,s-] is often useful, except [wd4,0-8] sometimes I can't manage the matter at all.
Eating is a way as useful as sleeping.
But it does a little harm to my health, so I rather choose sleeping.
When I eat, I feel that I can do what I want to do.
How joyful it is!
At this time, I can forget the unhappy things.
Sleeping and eating are the good was [wd7,6-15] for forgeting [fm1,-] the unhappy things, but the best was is trying to make myself happy, not angrying [wd2,-] for a small thing.
THE THIRTEENTH WEEK.
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS INVERNTION [fm1,-] .
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the two men from the goverment [fm1,-] , in order that everyone would be able to benefit from it.
but [fm3,-] two impostors shut the two men from the goverment [fm1,-] and came to the professor's house to take away the invention.
They pretended [vp1,1-2] very well, and they believed that nobody could recognize them.
So after they got the invention, they didn't think whither the invention was right or wrong.
They thought that they had been success [wd2,6-0] !
But the old professor was more clever [aj3,1-0] than the two impostors.
The invention which he gave them was the others papers.
Because he recognized that they were not the right men from government .
So when the other people were worrying about the invention, the professor was relaxing.
Because his invention was still on his desk!
THE FOURTEENTH WEEK
I got ill this week.
The illness and the medicine made me sad.
And I always wanted to sleep and had no energy in studying.
Sometimes I really wanted to put my heart into the exercises very much, but I couldn't.
At this time, I wish that I had had a good health.
And only when I was ill, did I know the health was important and sports was of great value.
But I often forget this.
n spare time, I'd rather watch TV, listen to the songs, read books or go to sleep.
Now I unstand [fm1,-] that the health is the base [wd3,-] of studying or working.
he exam of this term will come soon, I must take care of myself to build a good body and full confidence.
My Winter Holiday
The winter holiday, I always imagined it was relaxing and wonderful.
I has planed [fm2,-] where I would [vp6,7-10] go to play with my friends and how I spent every day.
I enjoyed myself when I thought [vp2,2-1] this, even in the exam.
But when the winter holiday came really, I found my idea was impossible.
Because my winter holiday was too short, it only had 11 days.
And I had a lot of things that must be done.
Such as: doing housework, doing home work, going over the text...Though these things weren't so wonderful, they brought me a valuable winter holiday.
In facts [np2,1-0] , they gave me much interesting [wd2,4-0] :when I saw the windows that were washed, I felt so happy.
Though it was a small thing, I could help my mum.
when I finished my homework, I felt satisfied.
Because I didn't lose the time in watching TV all day .Oh, I almost forgot a thing.That was, I has planned to finish reading three world famous works.
Now I has finished two.
I decided to read the last one.
But in fact, I couldn't understand them so well.
An Interesting Story
Today, I read an interesting story, it was talked [wd5,-] about: A young man had a new girl friend.
In order to impress her, the young man invited his girl friend to go to a world-famous restaurant one evening.
They had a very good supper, and they danced until midnight.
How wonderful this evening was!
They enjoyed themselves very much.
But at last, the waiter brought the bill to the young man.
When the young man saw how much he had to pay, his face turned [wd4, -2] white as a paper.
The waiter saw this, he thought the young man might faint, so he quickly brought a glass of ice-cold water and emptied over the young man's head .
Then he took the bill back and added to : ' Ice water: 50P' though it is an interesting story, it is instructive to me.
I have learned the texts"The Lost Necklace" and "The Emperor's New Clothes".
These tests have the same meaning as this interesting story.
That is : we shouldn't care much for honor and money.
If we do, the bad result will belong to us.
We must be honest.
The Spring Festival.
To children, the most happy [aj3,2-0] day in a year is the Spring Festival.
I like the Spring Festival very much.
But the reason why I like it is not the same as before.
In my childhood, I wondered why the Spring Festival was so special and all the people were different as usual [wd7,-] .
But it didn't matter.
I would forget this question soon.
Because there were so many things which made me happy .
For example: the beautiful new clothes, lots of suger, the flowers in all kinds of colors, the?
?, the interesting game with my little friends...
In my eyes, all the things were perfect.
How I wished the time could stop at that moment!
Now I am sixteen, not as [wd5,-] a little girl.
I still like the Spring Festival.
Because I can visit my relatives and talk with them .
I like the feeling when I stay with them.
How warm the feeling is!
We are often busy and have no time to visit each other .
So we are this special day very much.
To Chinese, reunion is an important thing.
My Father
In my childhood, I was afraid of my father.
Because I seldom saw him smile .
When I grow up, I unstand [fm1,-] my father is strict with me.
Perhaps he thinks I am not a child and I can unstand [fm1-] [cc3,2-2] many thinks [fm1,-] ,he talks with me more than before.
Through our talking, I know him a lot and I was afraid of him no longer.
In fact, my father like [vp3,2-1] smiling.
Sometimes he says [wd3,-] the joke to us.
His joke is not so interesting,but he still smiles louder than us.
He like [vp3,1-2] writing poems.
When he was young, his poems were often published.But as his daughter, I don't like this at all.
Why?
Otherwise, my Chinese maybe [ad1,2-4] is very good now.
Like many fathers, my father can repair lots of things,for example: light, washing-machine, radio, bicycle...
He is espected for this by my mother and I [pr4,4-0] .
This is my father, he is only a common man.
But in my heart, he is great.But in his heart,what he beleives me [,7-0] ?
On Duty.
It was [vp6,1-8] our turn to be on duty this week.
it wasn't [vp6,1-3] the first time.
But this time had some thing different from the last time.
Why?
Because our school is being built now .
So there are a lot of holes in the ground.
And there are many leaves falling into them.
Cleaning the ground was our duty.
So we must pick up these yellow leaves.
It was a hard and troublesome work [np5,4-0] .
But all of us never mind.
Though the yellow leaves were wet and dirty we tried o pick up every one.
In our heart, we believe our chool is very beautiful.
Though there are a lot of bricks and earth on the ground.
It is still beautiful.
Because a modern high building will stand here soon .
I think that we needn't do the cleaning so tiresome [wd2,-] at that time.
The Air Garden
There is an air garden on my house.
But I haven't gone [wd3,2-5] to it for some time.
Because I was busy very much .
Every day I must leave home in the morning and come back in the evening.
If I have spare time, I would rather stay at home and o some reading.
Today I suddenly wanted to go to the air garden.
So I did.
Ah!
Only two weeks!
Our air garden has changed a lot.
There were so many yellow leaves on the ground two weeks ago.
Everything looked like sleeping.
Today, any kinds of plants have come up.
The color of the small shoots is light green.
They are soft.
On the other hand, some plants have bloomed.
The colors of the flowers are very beautiful.
There are red, yellow, white, light red and light green.
All the things are new and soft.
You must be comfortable when you come into this green place.
So I was.
 [vp6,-] The feeling which the nature gives for is new [cc4,9-] and happy.
I love such feeling as this.
I love the nature, for I can forget all the trouble in it.
Take Good Care Of My Eyes
We had a medical examination this Saturday.
I couldn't be calm until this Saturday.
Because I always worried about my eyes .
My eyesight is not so good.
I must wear a pair of glass [np6,3-0] when I have class.
I can't see the whiteboard so well without the glass [np6,9-0] .
But I didn't pay attention to this.
I still didn't do the eye exercise, and still put my head low when I did my homewoek [fm1,-] .
So when I knew the examination was coming, I worried that my eyesight would be found worse than before through the examination.
That would be a bad news for my parents and me.
I said to myself: 'If I pass the examination, I will take good care of my eyes.
' At last, the report of examination told me that my eyesight was the same as before.
How excited I felt at that time!
But at the same time, I found most of my classmates' eyesight was not so good.
they [fm3,-] must wear the glass [np6,3-0] , too.
his was a bad thing.
Were we too hard at study?
I decide to take good care of my eyes.
I hope my classmates are the same as me.
I hope that I needn't worry about my eyesight in the next medical examination.
A group of English students will visit our school.
So the eadmaster gives me a report about the English students' action, and let me tell them what they will do in the coming days.
So I introduce that.
In [wd3,0-2] Monday morning our headmaster will meet them and will introuduce our school' condition.
In the afternoon they will be invited to visit the scientific building and the library.
On Tuesday they will visit the Great Wall with our school students.
Mr Zhang will tell us the interesting thing about the Great Wall.
In the evening, we will take a party in the room [fm3,-] 402.
On wensday [fm1,-] we will have a meeting.
We can talk about the experience and ideas of the study with each other.
On Thursday they will leave for Xi An by train at 9:45.
Learning How To Ride Bike.
I was eager to grasp how to ride bike [np7,1-] .
So my dad decided to teach me.
From then on, he taught me after he went home every day.
though [fm3,-] I often got a heavy fall, I ill learn [vp6,8-3] by my heart.
I didn't stop learning.
So two weeks later, I could ride bike without my dad's help.
One day, I first rided [fm2,-] the bike following my father on the street.
I was much careful and I said to myself from time to time:' Take it easy!
Take it easy'.
I will succeed!
My dad always noticed me, but he didn't help me when I was in trouble.
He only said to me that I should look ahead in stead of looking at the bike.
At last, we went home safely.
My dad praised me and I was excited very much.
I succeeded!
My mum smiled and asked me if I was so worried just now.
I pretended to be calm and said "no".
but my father said: 'A lying girl.
But I was worried more than you.
'
April 26th.
"Hello!
It's Huang Xiao dan speaking.
Who it it [wd6,-] ?
" " Hello!
It's Xuan Yun sheng.
" "What's the matte [fm1,-] ?
" I asked.
"Oh, no matter [np1,1-] .
I only want to talk with you.
Are you free now?
" she said.
"I'm doing homework now.
But since you want to talk with me, I will give [cc3,-2] some face to you.
" I smiled and answered.
"That's great!
I went shopping with my mum last night.
We saw two men fright [wd3,4-0] .
Can you guess what has appened?
" she asked.
"Ah, I often see and hear these things.
Did a thief steal a man's wallet?
" I guessed.
" Oh, no.
why they fought was a man knocking the other's shoulder .
only [fm3,-] for this, they quarrelled at first, then they didn't give in.
at [fm3,-] last they fought.
" She said.
" Oh..." I wondered: weren't [fm3,-] the two men foolish?
In Grangzhou [fm1,-] which is a beautiful modern city, there are some people like these.
They really make all the Guang zhou's people disappointed very much.
May.
6th.
I'm doing my homework at this moment.
But I'm thinking about another thing --- the three holidays which has just passed.
Our study is hard and we are often busy.
So I thought my holidays would be relaxing and wonderful at first.
But in fact I didn't feel happy in these days.
For what?
Because --- because I have done a wrong thing .
My mum's heart was sad.
And how I regretted [wd2,-] at that time!
I should not have done the wrong thing.
Why not think it over before I did it?now [fm3,-] perhaps my mum has forgotten this thing.
She loves me deeply.
I'm sure that she will pardon me.
But I can't pay off what I have done.
I can't pardon myself in [wd3,4-2] some time.
It is no use regretting what has been done now.
So I know what I can do is treat [vp6,8-3] my mother well.
I decide trying [vp5,2-5] my best to do it, and I will not make her sad any longer.
May 12th.
Our headmaster Wang died.
He lelf [fm1,-] us forever!
When I heard his bad news, my heart [cc2,-1] sang.
I couldn't imagine that he left this world so fast.
All the people said that he devoted himself to our school's development and he was respected by the teachers and students.
I knew this.
But what he impressed upon me wasn't this.
In my heart I always thought he was a very kind man as if he wouldn't scold his students.
I remembered he had given a talk to us on a meeting about the problem two years before [wd3,2-0] .
Finishing his talk, he went and sat down near me.
He asked us how we studied and if we would continue studying in the NO.4 Middle School.
How kindly he said!
He only asked and collected our ideas, and he didn't order us to do anything.
At last he encouraged us and wished us would get a very good result.At that time I was thinking that he was like our friend more than our headmaster.
All the things have passed.
It only remains some memory.
But this is enough to encourage us studying hard.
My New School
Being a new student, I went to my new school and felt excited.
When I came into the school, I felt the air was special [wd3,-1] fresh.
Because my new school was large very much, and there were many big trees around it .
My school had [vp6,2-0] three high buildings.
One was for our experiments, the other two were for our having classes.
Though my school had [vp6,1-4] thirty-six classes and there [wd5,1-3] a wide playground .
It was very valuable for students to develop their body [np6,3-0] .
Look!
There were some students playing basketball on it.
Seeing all the things, I could imagine how wonderful were [wd1,5-7] the following days which I would have.
n fact, I always took pride in my new school.
Because it was a key school and it had a history of seventy years .
It said [vp7,1-12] that there were many famous men and women graduating in my school.
So I thought that the teachers must be very good and they were strict with their students.
Since there were such good teachers, the students must be clever and respect their teachers.
My New School
My new school is a key school which has a history of 70 years.
There were many famous men and women graduating from my school.
My new school is beautiful and big.
There are so many big trees around it.
It has two teaching buildings, one lab building and a big playground on which some students are doing exercises.
That [pr2,0-6] is valuable for students to develop their bodies.
Now my school has thirty six [fm2,-] classes, one thousand eight hundred [fm2,-] students and two hundred teachers.
In my new school, the teachers are very good and strict with us.
So we respect them.
Dear Peter: We're so glad you're coming to join us on Sunday.
Here is how you can find us.
When you come into the gate of the People's Park, you may go down the rode [fm1,-] which is near a small river.
So a few minutes later, you well find [vp6,2-5] a bridge over the river.
Crossing the bridge, you should turn to the right, and you can see a small hill which is not far away.
Then you keep on going towards it.
When you reach the foot of the small hill, you should turn [wd3,s-] over the hill.
After doing that, you can see a small woods [np6,2-0] , then, we will wait [vp2,2-4] on you in it.
June, 14 Sunny
It is nearly thirty centigrade this afternoon.
So hot the day is!
I see that there are about seven to eight children swimming in the river.
They are mostly good at swimming.
Look!
A little girl is learning how to swim with her mother's help.
I like swimming, too.
I used to swim in my childhood.
I still remember the last time that [pr5,6-7] I swam was about ten years ago.
At that time I was spending my holiday in Beijing.
The days in June are very hot, but I like them.
I believe that June is one of the best months in a year.
Our Monitor
Our monitor's name is Zhang Wei hua.
He is seventeen.
He is not only our monitor but also the head of our school's football team.
He is one point seven three meters high and seventy kilogram [np6,1-0] .
He is fond of music and is goot [fm1,-] at sports.
So he is strong very much .
As a league member, he respects teachers and often helps us when we are in trouble.
He is active to join our school's actions.
What a good league member he is!
A piece of advice
I think everyone in our class wants to improve your [pr3,7-1] lesson.
But how to do is a problem.
Now, I'll tell [cc3,1-5] you a piece of advice.
A piece of advice on how to improve you [pr4,3-1] lesson is "Make notes ".
"Make notes" is different to "Take notes.
" For example, in English class, teacher [np6,0-2] always writes some important things in [wd3,4-1] blackbord.
 [np7,1-] We must "Take notes".
But we must also "Make notes".
What the teacher said is more important than those on the blackbord.
I hope everyone "Make notes", but not "Take notes".
Please keep the school clean.
It was [vp6,1-7] a month since the new term began.
We clean the school every week, but I always find [cc3,-1] dirty in some place.
I think it must be make [vp7,5-3] by few [np8,7-1] students.
we [fm3,-] must look on our school as our home, and make it clean.
It is easy for us to do it.
Pay attention yourself.
Don't throw the waste on the floor, throw it into the dustbin.
I think some time later, our school will turn clean.
Also you can think if we don't do that, the rubbish will do harm to our health.
Let us try our best to keep our school clean.
Guang Zhou's [fm2,-] weather
Guang zhou's weather always changes.
Do you agree with me?
I think some say "yes" and some say "no".
beg [fm3,-] you to hear my explain.
I think everyone have [vp3,1-4] the same to [wd3,3-] me.
For example, the day you went out, the weather was good, the sun was shinning, you enjoyed it very much.
But when some time had ted [fm1,-] ,the weather changed quickly.
the [fm3,-] sun had hidden, just a moment, it was raining hard.
How disppointed [fm1,-] you are!
Perhaps the worst think [fm1,-] to you was [wd4,-] you forgot to take a raincoat.Ha Ha!
How foolish you re!
I'm sure you will think when you go out in Guang Zhou [fm2,-] in summer, the worth [cc4,-1] thing is to take a raincoat.
The sport's spirit
The NO.4 middle school's sport meeting [cc2,6-2] has past [wd2,5-0] .
But in the meeting, I found the ports spirit.
I didn't know him, but his spirit deeply marked n my heart.
I still remembered the thing.
At that time, he joined the running of 1500 metre [np6,3-0] .
The weather is hot and the sun is shining [vp6,8-0] .After 800 metre's running, he was so tired that he couldn't keep the high peed.
By and by he as left to the end.
His sweat droped down.
He wiped the sweat away and went on running.
Suddenly he felt [wd3,2-4] down on the ground.
All the people were shouting at him and encouraged him.
He didn't give up.
He did what he could to raise himself.
Finally he raise [vp6,2-4] up and continued running.
Everyone claped their [pr3,2-1] hands.
However he was the last to the end, but he just like [wd7,11-2] the winner.
His spirit had already in everyone's heart.
I and my book
I like reading book, because it tells [cc3,6-3] me some knowledge and also tells [cc3,0-3] me some advice.
I like reading book [np6,3-2] about science.
The book about science can tell me the strange thing I don't know.
The book just like windows, I can look though [fm1,-] it and look around the would [fm1,-] .
The book is also like a teacher.
It often gives me some advice on how to learn the object such as English, maths, chinese [fm3,-] ... Not only these but also it gives me advice on how to do good deed, how to help others.
From the book, I have learn [cc3,2-4] [vp6,2-2] some knowledge.
Do you like reading books?
My friend
Last week I was walking in the street.
Suddenly I heard a voice : " Hi, How are you?
" I stopped and turned around.
Oh, it is my old classmate.
Xiao jie is [vp6,2-8] my classmate when I was in Primary [fm3,-] school.
Now he isn't my classmate, but I still remember him.
We are the [wd5,2-6] good friend [np6,4-0] in school.
After [cj1,0-2] say "Hello", he told me is past and told me his new school, new friend, new thing.
I let him to my home [,5-0] and invited him to have dinner.
In the afternoon, he left.
Before he left, he gave me his new address, and new telephone number.
I was so happy because I could meet him again.
He is always my good friend.
Mid-exam.
We will have a mid-exam in a week.
It is the first exam when we are in Gread [fm1,-] Two.
Everyone will try his best to catch [cc3,6-3] a good mark.
so they are working hard in [wd3,3-2] their lesson.
You can see them in some place, such as in the classroom and even in [wd3,2-2] the road, they are doing some studying now.
How diligent they are!
After class, you can always see some of them still in the classroom, doing exeicies [fm1,-] or quarreling at [wd3,2-1] something.
We will also try hard and try to do the best.
because we think we are always the best .
Autumn's trip
This autumn we went to Xie chao Hill for the trip.
Last Saturday, the weather was good, the sun was shining.
When we reached Xie Chao Hill, we couldn't held [wd3,2-1] crying.
How beautiful Xie Chao Hill is!
The hill and the lake were green, they looked nice.
We held a high breath, the wind was so cool that we were feld very good.
we walked alone [fm1,-] the road and heard some bird crying sometimes.
After a walk, we arrived at a place where it looked like a park, there had [wd3,1-2] some store [np6,1-0] and we did some shopping .
We were [wd5,1-3] enjoyed this trip, and we had a good time.
Clock
I have a clock.
He is my good friend.
He has a round face.
On it there has [wd3,3-3] a beautiful picture.
He has three hands which move around day and night.
So he is so busy all the time.
He can [vp9,1-1] rang, when the morning comes, he well [vp6,1-5] ranging and wakes me up.
He just like [vp3,2-1] shouting: "The sun rises up, you must get up.
" Sometimes when I look at the clock, I always think: " the clock doesn't feel tired, he still working [vp6,2-1] quietly.
His spirit is worth studying.
He is just like a model.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning, because he had completed the papers of his new invention which everyone would benefited [vp9,2-2] from it.
he decided to give it to the government.
Two government [wd3,1-5] would come for the papers.
But at half past ten, two impostor [np6,1-0] came for the papers.
The professor didn't trust them and gave them some wrong papers.
After some time, the police came and told the professor that the two men were impostor [np6,4-0] .
To he police surprise, the professor said it was not necessary, because the papers he gave them were wrong, he still got the papers on his invention.
English.
English is the most important language in the world.
We must try our best to improve it.
Many country [np6,1-0] speaks [vp3,4-1] English and look on English as their mother language.
When we are in other country, you [pr3,6-3] will find that English is useful.
You must speak English and only English can make people understand.
English is also useful in our country.
When you see the foreigner, you can say hello to him and also when you do besines [fm1,-] with other country, you must speak English.
English is the language that many country [np6,1-0] uses [vp3,3-1] it .
we must work hard at English.
Computer.
Computer is a modern machine.
In 1946, an american [fm3,-] professor whose name was John W. Mauchly invented the first computer.
Computer improves quickly.
today, many families have a computer, and new computer is more smaller [aj3,1-0] than the first one.
Computer can do much [np8,0-1] things such as doing business, shopping, relaxation and so on.
computer [fm3,-] can also do much [np8,0-1] things that people can't do so that it is very useful for me, for us and for all the people.
Computer will have deep effect on my life.
A new year.
1997 will come in three days.
Now, I wish everyone happy new year.
In the new year, I will do best than the last .
I'm a student so I will try hard in my lesson.
In 1997, we will have five subject's [np4,1-1] exams.
It is important for us to do it better.
The exams have deep effect on my life.
Everyone in our class wants to collage [wd2,-] [fm1,-] after school [wd3,s-] , so in 1997, we must try hard.
I think it is easy to say but hard to do.
But I also think e will do it better than last, because we're always the best.
The Spring Festival
The spring Festival is the important day in China.
When it comes, people begin going shopping and doing cleaning.
On that day, people get up early and put on their new clothes.
The younger greet the older.
The older give " lucky money" to the younger.
They visit each other and their friends.
During these days, people all enjoy themselves.
We ought to learn from Lei fen [fm1,-] .
This month is a memorable month.
In this month, we ought to learn from our model --- comrade [fm3,-] Lei fen [fm1,-] .
Lei fen [fm1,-] was a good man.
He had given [vp6,2-11] all he had to our Party, our country and our people.
He tried to serve [vp1,1-3] for the people, doing what he could to help others.
When you are [vp6, 2-10] in trouble, he always put his heard [fm1,-] in helping you.
As it known [vp7,2-2] to all, Lei fen [fm1,-] is our model.
We must always learm [fm1,-] from Lei fen [fm1,-] .
His spirit will [vp9,2-4] always in my mind.
I will never forget him.
Spring Spring is comming [fm1,-] .
When the weather turns warm, [wd4,s-] when everything comes up, spring is comming [fm1,-] .
Walking in the street, you will see all the thing [np6,2-0] have great [cc6,-1] changed.
New shoots of tree comes [vp3,4-3] up from the stem.
All shoots are green when you see them, you will feel [wd4,-] natural.
The wind is comming [fm1,-] toward you and brush your face .
The shoot sways in the wind.
It looks like some one is shaking hands with you.
The sun is shinning [fm1,-] ,giving all shoots energy to the earth,and the hold world turns very warm.
Our biology teacher When we talk to [wd3,3-15] our biology teacher--- Miss Yu, everyone in our class will sing highly for her teaching.
In our biology class, we are not absent minded, we listen carefully and take some note.
Miss Yu always lets us into the sea which has [cc3,1-2] much knowledge [,13-0] .
She often gives us many example [np6,1-0] in lesson and we enjoy the things very much.
By and by, we love biology.
Poor knowledge as we have [cc3,4-0] , we always have some question in many kind f biology, she tries her best to explain to us.
Miss Yu is a ood teacher, she leads s to succeed.
Pollution
When you are walking in the street, you'll feel terrible.
This only because of the poisonous gases .
In the street, cares [fm1,-] run on.
At the end of the car, the poisonous gases are given off.
The poisonous included CO, SO2, O2 and so on.
Million [np6,0-4] of tons of waste and porsonous [fm1,-] gases are sent into the air with the smoke.
These do harm to our life.
Scientists try to find ideas to do with the gases.
For example, Don't permit cars sent out the gases, plant more tree.
I think all the things must be done by the people.
Everyone must try his best to change it by himself.
Raining [wd3,-] day.
The weather in Guang zhou in spring turns [wd3,-] quickly.
the sun shines in the morning, but it is a heavy rain in the afternoon.
When it rains, it is trouble [wd2,-] for everyone to take an umbrella.
Because of the heavy rain, the street is so wet that everyone have [vp3,1-3] to walk carefully than ever.
After raining , the street turns cleaner and cleaner.
The weather is cool and you will feel well.
The sun appears in the sky and the street turns warmmer [fm1,-] and warmmer [fm1,-] .
School's singer.
" The school's singer [np6,2-7] will have a atch in a week.
" It was [vp6,1-10] an interesting thing for all the students in our class.
There were four students in our class joined the match [,9-0] .
We all wished them succeed.
The four players tried their best to improve their voice so that they could get the good result.
At the day when he match began .
They all put their heard [fm1,-] into t. everyone sang high praise for them.
Finally, Xu Wei feng on the match and he could join the final match.
We wish him succeed in the end.
A chess match.
There will be a chess match in a month.
It is an interesting thing that this match is between a man and a compter [fm1,-] .
This man had [vp6,2-5] won more than ten time [np6,3-0] .
But this time, he is challonged [fm1,-] by a computer.
The computer is made by IBM company.
It can work millions of times in a second.
How far [wd3,10-2] it is!
You can suppose that the match will [vp9,2-7] much exciting than everyone else.
I think this match is not only a chess match but also a match between a man and a machine.
Computer is made by a man, it can do more work than a man.
But without command, it can do nothing.
So a man is much clever than computer.
The man will win the match at last.
Zhu jiang River Pollution.
When your [pr4,1-5] walk along the Zhujiang River, you will smell a terrible gas from the River.
This will o harm to our life.
I think you may have a question: why the river turned dirty.
This because of the thing what the people had done .You can see someone throw waist thing to the river sometimes.
When time pasted [wd2,2-0] , there are some rublish [fm1,-] on the river.
The water turns black and tastes bad.
So we must try our best to keep the river clean, not throwing anything to the river, only we do it, the river be able [vp9,3-2] turned dear.
The table tennis's world cup.
In this month, there is a table tennis match in Britain.
Many country [np6,1-0] send their sporters [fm2,-] to join this match.
I think this match must [vp9,4-4] very interesting and citing.
Our country's sporters are good at this game, so every sporter [fm2,-] wants to win the match.
But they must be challenged by sporters [fm2,-] who is [vp3,3-3] in other country.
As we all knew, last time our team got all golden [wd4,4-0] .
This team will try their best to succeed a second time.
Everyone in our country wishes our team succeed again.
Basketball playground
Last week, a new basketball playground completed [vp7,4-0] .
How exciting [aj4,1-2] we are!

Every day at 7 o'clock, when one reach [vp3,2-1] school, many students has [vp3,2-5] played games on the playgroune [fm1,-] .
At 7 o'clock P.M. many students still played [vp6,3-1] game in [wd3,4-2] the playground.
I think playing basketball is good to our health, but playing for a long time is harm to our health.
Many students played basketball, forgeting [fm1,-] to have dinner or supper.
It is harm to our stomach [np6,1-0] .
I think we must play in a [cc4,2-1] fit time.
My New School
Our school is a key school.
It has a history of over seventy years.
After graduation, many students became a famous man [np6,5-0] .
Now our school has thirty-six classes, 1800 students and more than 200 teachers and workers in our school .
Our school is big and beautiful.
Around the school there are many trees.

The teachers in our school are excellent.
The students loved [vp6,2-4] there school and teachers.
A basketball match.
Last week we had a basketball match.
It was an exciting match.
This time our class VS class Four .
The students in class [fm3,-] Four are good at sport.
They also good at basketball [,4-0] .
They are taller than our class and their technology of basketball is stronger than us sn4,7-0] .So when the match began, they played at high speed x,9-0] .
The sponter [np6,1-5] [fm1,-] of our class try their best to prevent the class to get [vp5,4-1] mark.
When they get a mark, everyone in our class hit their hand together [wd7,12-0] .
At last, class [fm3,-] Four won the match.
In fact, our class played well.
June 14  hot [fm3,-] 
How hot today is!
In the afternoon, the tempiture [fm1,-] almost reached 30C.
This afternoon, when I was walking along the river, I saw seven or eight children swimming in the river.
In [wd3,0-6] them, some were good at swimming.
As I seeing [vp6,2-0] , I noticed a little girl was learning swimming, the one who teached [fm2,-] her was her mother.
Seeing this, I couldn't help thinging [fm1,-] about my younth [fm1,-] [fm1,-] .
I used to swim in my childhood.
I also remembered [vp6,2-7] my last swimming was ten years before [wd3,6-0] .
At that time, I was spending my holiday in Beijing.
I regarded June as a good month for swimming.
THE SPORT I LIKE BEST
The sport I like best is to play table tennis and badminton.
How joyful to have a game of table tennis or badminton after a day of study at school [, 17-0] .
It can make us relaxing.
It is great value [np1,1-] for us to play table tennis or badminton after school.
Playing table tennis or badminton can build our bodies, prevent from getting too fat, and keep us healthy, give us valuable practice in helping the eyes, brain and muscles to work together.
Another, playing table tennis and badminton are also very useful for character-training.
It is help [wd2,-] to study.
Speaker's Selection
There is a speaker's selection in our school.
Many students take part in it.
Luo Qing Jun and Ye Tia ing also sign up.
The selection way will [vp7,3-2] be change.
There will be plentys [fm1,-] of prizes.
The winner will be given the prizes.
I think it will be colourful.
In fact, the speaker's selection is a great valuable amusement or us.
For example, it can increase [cc3,2-2] our knowledge, improve our expressing power and thinking power.
I hope more and more students are able to take part in it.
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS INVENTION
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the country.
He decided to take his papers to London himself, but the trip was too much for him.
So there would be two men come for the papers [,9-0] .
But at half past ten, There were two impostor [np6,1-0] came for the papers.
Professor was so clever and careful.
He didn't give the real papers to them.
He only gave them some papers put behind some books on the shelf , and they left in a hurry.
Shortly after that, there were two policemen came [vp4,-] for the case's information, but the professor said that it was necessary to catch the impostor.
Then he explained it to the policemen.
At last, he decided to take the papers to London himself.
WHEN WE LEAN ENGLISH WE MUST DO AS AN ENGLISHMAN
When we learn English we must do as an Englishman.
First, we cannot speak English with our language order .
For example, we can speak [wd3,2-8] "I like it very much" but cannot speak " I very like it", we can speak " I write the letters with a pen" [wd4,-] cannot speak "I use a pen to write the letters".
So we must do as an Englishman when we are learning English, and speak English in English order.
How to speak English with right order?
We should read English aloud every morning as possible [pp2,6-0] , which helps to train the language sence [fm1,-] .
And tell story with our language, because it can force us develop our mouth muscle [,14-0] .
MY FIRST DANCING
This week we had [vp6,3-6] gone all out to practise dancing that was my first dancing.
I had never joined [vp6,3-14] in the Art Festival of school since I studied in N0.
4 Middle school [fm3,-] .But this year I have to take part in it for our class.
We didn't go home after school so that we may [vp6,9-5] have more time to pratise [fm1,-] .
Although we are all hard we think it is very valuable, so we have no murmur.
I believe that we will secceed [fm1,-] by the effort.
THE ART FESTIVAL OF SCHOOL FINALS
This Saturday, the Art Festival of school had [vp6,7-5] been on in Peilei Theatry [fm1,-] .
We are all excited and happy.
This time I am one of the actors so I am special [wd2,2-1] excited.

The ardent applause sounded again and again.
The viewers [wd3,-] were very warm hearted [fm2,-] .
This finals is [vp3,2-5] much better than last year .
For example, the student's fashion show and the recital with dancing have never appeared, these have great characterisic.
There are three performance programmes one gets three class and the other two get second class.
My Winter Holiday
My Winter holiday is rich and colorful.
The first is the Spring Festival and "Yuan [fm1,-] shao [fm1,-] " Festival.
The other is to receive lots of money for " Li shi", it is I like best.
The spring Festival is not only the beginning of a year but also the social intercourse time.
People give the presents to each other and greet each other.
We say [cc3,1-6] some congratulations to bless each other.
We are enjoying ourselves.
The " Yuang [fm1,-] shao [fm1,-] " Festival is a day for family and for those people who [wd5,4-2] in love.
We eat "Tang Yuan" together at home.
The Tang Yuan" is sweet and our hearts are also sweet.
But it is a pity that we are not permitted to fire the Smoking Flower.
Whether it is permitted that must be oven more colourful.
The Spring Festival
The Spring Festival is coming!
All over he city is filled with the happy atmosphere.
The people are smiling.
uses [wd3,-] , cars, bicks [fm1,-] and many people go up and down the street.
The voices of the them sound like a song.
People have a habit of going to the Flowers [fm3,-] Market [fm3,-] .
It is said that people who have one around the Flowers [fm3,-] Market [fm3,-] will change their lucks.
So people ill go to the Flowers Market at the end of the year.
Although it is raining, people still go to the Flowers Market as before.
The lowers Market get [vp3,3-5] more beautiful and more [wd6,9-1] beautiful.
All kinds of flowers compete each other.
The big oranges, roses, chrysanthemums are taking a bath in the rain.
They seem very attractive.
 [wd4,0-10] The first day of the year, almost people [wd4,1-3] go to temples.
 [wd4,0-15] The second day of the year, almost [wd4,0-9] people pay a visit to their friends or relatives.
It is the most [wd7,-s] thing to get together with family.
The plan of a year is made in Spring.
People will full heart of hopes to meet the new year!
The cripples also can live a happy life in the Spring Festival.
The office of the street has launched a movement to help the cripples live a happy life in the Spring Festival.
They call on the residents to give some money to help the cripples.
Of corse the residents are glade [fm1,-] to help them.
The street officials get the money together to buy some gift [np6,3-0] to [wd3,13-2] the cripples.
The street officials borrow serveral [fm1,-] wheelchairs from hospital, they take the cripples to the Flowers Market with them.
The cripples are all great happy and thankful.
They shake hands with the officials tremulously and can't keep back their tears.
Such is the socialist society!
The knowledges [np5,-] exchange.
Each country cannot exist lonely.
He must in exchange for other countries [,6-0] .
Expecially [fm1,-] the knowledges [np5m-] exchange .
Hong Kong is coming back [wd4,5-1] the homeland.
The knowledges [np5,1-0] of Guang zhou and Hong Kong are both rich and interesting.
We should study each other.
I think we should change the rule for education.
Students should learn [cc3,2-1] knowledges [np5,-] about the practical [wd4,-] .
And what we have learned can be used in practical [wd2,9-0] .
I think what we have learned are [vp3,6-1] useless.
Some of them are uninteresting.
For example, Hong Kong's students are learning the practical English, such as the letters for job, reports, and so on.
although we have never learned these .
Whether [wd3,0-9] someone asks us to write a letter for job, then how can we do.
So it is necessary to study each other and change our old rules for education.
The first failing [wd2,-] in English
Last week we had [vp6,3-8] had the first English exam in this term.
I greatly regretted that I had failed in the exam.
I had never failed in the English exam since my learning English.
But this time I had [vp6,4-1] failed.
The 56.5 being written on the paper, I can't believe in my eyes.
I thought I was sorry to Miss Lin and myself.
Why did I fail in the exam?
Because I had paid no attention to going over the lessons .
In the future, I will try my best to improve my English and get high marks in the each exam!
Be careful of the fire
Last week, a great fire was [vp7,3-2] broken out in the Weng chang Road.
he main reason is that when a child was playing the TV game .
he wires were suddenly shortcut.
The wires were heated, the tempereture [fm1,-] was so high that a fire could [vp9,2-2] broke out.
The fire soon spread through the while [fm1,-] house and the neighbours'.
There was a man died of the fire [,7-0] .
The fire give [vp3,2-5] people a lesson: be careful of the fire.
Pay attention to reading.
Reading is important to us, xpecially [fm1,-] the English learner [np6,8-0] .
There are two sorts of reading.
One is to read aloud, the other is to read the compositions.
Miss Lin had once said in class that reading helped to train language sense.
There will be a hearing test in the examination.
So we should pay more attention to reading.
Stone-Cliz has aid that what you had read.
What you can hear .
If you want to get high marks in the examination you should pay attentino [fm1,-] to reading,including reading aloud and reading compositions.
English Corner.
Sunday, I looked through the English weekly.
It said that there was an English corner in Shi chuang Cang Xi xian ong hang zheng middle school, every Wednesday afternoon, a free talk in English is held in the reading room after class.
A good many students from different classes and grades attend it.
they talk talk [wd6,2-5] about all kinds of things in English just like old friends.
I envy it very much.
Though there is also an English corner in Zhong shan library, it is far away.
I wish there will e an English Corner in our school reading room before long.
Our School's Education Examination.
Last Wednesday, some leaders came to our school to examine the education work.
In order to welcome the leaders we had cleaned the classroom and the meeting room.
All the students had worked hard.
All the things in the classroom were in good order.
Two leaders had the physics and biology with us together.
The old teacher Dai Qi zheng had gave some advice to the biology teacher.
We were in harmony with teacher and completed the teaching duty.
At last, the leaders thought highly of our school, and hoped that our school will [vp6,5-7] make even more progress in the future.
Li Ming felt [cc3,-2] great difficult to learn English at first [pr2, 9-0] .
His teacher had greatly encouraged him and helped him.
He worked hard, and often asked the teacher [wd4,3-8] some advice on how to learn a foreign language.
Before long he had [vp6,3-3] made rapid progress and was praised by his teacher.
Now he can write a letter in English, but he still feels it is limited, and he decides that he will try his best to improve his English.
I'm glade to hear from you and be your pen pal.
I will tell you something about my study.
There are two class-building [np6, 3-0] , a dormitory, eight labs and a library in our school.
Now our school has one hundred and thirty teachers and one thousand five hundred students.
we have maths, physics, chemistry, chinese [fm3,-] , history, English, politics, and physical culture.
Otherwise, we also have the computer language and typing.
In my spare time, I like playing basketball, playing football and reading.

I want to know hether your school is as good as our school.
Would you tell me hether your school is as good s our school.
Would you tell me about your school next time?
The best to you!
our pen pal: Zhang Hua.
Welcome to visit our biology lab.
The biology lab has two classroom [np6,1-0] .
though it isn't very big, there are many instrument [np6,1-4] and specimen in it.
two teachers and laboratory technicians work in it and work hard.
They are very strick [fm1,-] with students.
students can have classes and do experiment in the laboratory.
Many students are interested in biology.
After class, they can come here to do experiment.
With the teachers' help, they have learned many useful things.
I live in a small town with long history.
The small town has a population of two million.
It lies near a river, which is at the foot of hills.
There are flowers, grass and trees here and there.
It's very beautiful.
Since 1980, great changes have taken place in the small town.
Many buildings are put up, and a hospital, two schools are also built.
The town takes on a new look so I love the my town and the people.
Be quiet!
Please be quiet!
There is a good news [np5,2-0] for you.
There is going to be an English speech match at two o'clock next Saturday afternoon I n the library reading room.
You can choose the topic freely, but each one can't speak over ten minutes.
Just the students of Senior Two .
It is a good chance for you.
Don't miss the chance!
You must sign up in the No.303 classroom before this Saturday, and before the fifth winer [fm1,-] will gain the prize, an English-Chinese dictionary each, I hope.
You will take an active in it and become the winer [fm1,-] !
My new school.
My new school is a key school with a history of seventy [wd4,4-0] .
It has two teaching building [np6,2-0] , a lab building and a big playground, in [wd3,4-6] which students take part in sports.
It is large and surrounded with trees.
It's very beautiful.
There are thirty-six classrooms.
One thousand eight hundred students and over two hundred teachers in it .all the teachers are excellent and strict with students.
stundents [fm1,-] show respects to their teachers.
Now many students who graduated from the school have become famous people.
So I even like my new school, and make up my mind to study hard and reward [vp1,0-3] to my teachers.
Today is my birthday.
In the morning my parents and I went shopping.
Mother bought me a toy doll and a pair of new shoes as my birthday present.
I liked them very much.
Then we went to [wd4,0-2] North sea Park to go boating, where we had played [vp6,15-3] nearly two hours.
At noon, we had a good lunch in a restaurant.
We had a good time.
June the fourteenth.
Today I saw seven-eight children swimming in the river.
Most of them were good player [np6,5-0] .
A little girl was learning swimming, and her mother taught her.
I often went [vp2,0-2] to swimming in my childhood.
When I spent my holiday in Beijing in [wd5,2-3] ten years ago, I went [vp2,1-2] to swimming for the last time.
I thought June was the best months on a year.
I like football very much.
I often play football after school.
I'm team [np7,-] leader on [wd3,2-3] the school team.
Our team had [vp6,2-5] failed in the last game.
But we do not take [cc5,-4] our fate lying down.
Our teacher has us train hard.
Our team to be sure win in nest game .
The spirit of candles
One candle likes [wd2,2-4] very small and ordinary.
But its spirit is really great.
In the dark, it burns itself, so that it can light all of us.
The light of a andle is as important as a sunbeam.
ur teachers are like the candles.
They spent their life in teaching us.
If we leave the teacher, we will have [cc3,2-2] no knowledge, become [wd4, 7-2] very silly, as if a man who can not see.
Candles always don't get their pay from the people, and the teachers give up their life to education.
Their pirit is the same, and we thank them just the same, too.
An elephant and a judge.
This is an interesting story which happened in England in 1994.
There was a football match between Arsenal and Chelsea.
When the watch was going to begin .
Suddenly, an elephant walked into the stadium, and stood in the middle of the ground.
People were all in surprise.
At that time, the elephant played with one football, using its long nose.
One man came near the elephant.
He handed a stick, which was Hanging [vp7,s-] bananas.
He put up the stick, so that the elephant could see the bananas, and he could tempt it to leave.
But the elephant didn't be interested [vp2,4-3] in the bananas, and went on playing with the ball.
After a moment, the man brought a basket, which filled [vp7,3-7] with apples, pears, mangoes, tomatoes and oranges.
This time, he didn't succeed again.
Then, a group of man came.
They tried their best to push the elephant.
But it was big and heavy, nothing could make it to move a little.
At last, a judge came.
He watched the elephant playing the ball for minutes.
Then he thought, " The elephant must be interested in football.
Maybe it knows the rules, too".
he judge took out a red card to the elephant.
To everyone's surprise, the elephant immediately put away the ball, and walk [vp6,8-3] away the ground.
The judge smiled and announced the match was beginning.
Love our class
Recently, my classmate Feng Yu jing goes to school early in the morning.
Does he do so in order to get more time to study?
No.
On fact [np2,1-0] , to practise running, a long run, on the playground .
The sports meeting will begin this Friday.
Feng Yuying will take part in 1,500 metres running.
Now, he is active in practice.
It shows that he deeply hopes to be the best, to win for our class.
Everyone in the class must love it from his heart, must consider it as important as his life, and serve it whenever [wd3,3-0] .
Feng Yu Ying is very good, all of us should learn from him.
Football in our Class.
Many boys in our class liked [vp6,5-4] football since Senior 1.
They not only often played football inside and outside the school.
But also watched a football match on TV on holiday [,20-0] .
Very much as many boys liked it, our class football team was not the best one in four classes.
At that time, Liang Jian ling was a leader, that is to say, he was the captain of our class football team.
But he did not lead the team to get the champion.
This made everybody sad.
No one scolded them, because they had done their best, defeat looked reasonable.
Now, football in our class has good chance to develop. [cc4,-3] .
Su Wei jie's coming makes everyone very joyful, particularly is [wd5,9-3] Liang Jian ling.
we [fm3,-] all believe tomorrow will be better.
Before long, there will be a football match between Class Four and our class.
On that day, victory is ours.
Why He Didn't Finish Homework
To [pp2,-2] our surprised, Liang Jian ling didn't finish the homework twice this week.
and it was the nglish homework that he did not finish.
But, it was impossible hat he did so in order to make our headteacher angry.
Then why he did so .
I wanted to know.
I thought and thought, and at last I found out a reason to explain.
Because his other name is " BEAR'' .
As we know from the fifth lesson, bear is a beast which half-hibernates.
So as soon as the winter comes, "bear" will become very luzy [fm1-] , this is reasonable.
I hope this article can make Liang Jian ling " wake up", and make others joy.
Particular Friends.
Today, two practical [cc4,1-1] teachers are going back to their school.
It has passed four weeks since we knew each other.
On these days, we get on well.
we usually study, talk together, and even play games together.
Because they are as old as us nearly [ad1,6-0] , we regard them as friends more than teachers.
The majority of the class like them very much.
Today, we have to say good- bye to them.
Before leaving, they give us a perfect football.
Because they know we all like playing football .We will look on the football as an expensive present and keep it well.
let's remember these two particular [cc4,1-1] friends for ever.
The Main Idea of " Zhu Fu"
We learned a text calls [vp4,4-4] "Zhu Fu" days ago.
It was a novel which was written by Lu Xun, the famous writer.
The main character in this novel was Xiang Lin Sao.
She was a working wowan [fm1,-] who was ppressed before liberation.
After her husband had died, Xiang Lin Sao [fm3,-] didn't take her fate lying down.
She fled.
She went to Lu Town, and worked for a landlord.
Because she was not lazy, the owner liked her.
But not long later, her husband's mother sent two men to kidnap her back.
She was forced to remarry and then had a son.
Two years later, her second husband died, her only son was eaten by the wolves.
Xiang Lin Sao went to Lu Town again.
But some one laughed at her and the owner drove her out.
She became a beggar, and she believed in spirits.
She looked frightful.
At last, she died before new year... How wretched she was!
From now on, we should more [ad1,1-1] love [cc3,3-2] our living, [wd4,10-1] study harder.
Collective Cohesion .
our [fm3,-] class is an excellent upward collective.
But the blemish in an otherwise perfect thing is it lacks cohesion.
Once, the head teacher asked us, " Who is willing to carry the mud from the botanical garden?
" no one answered.
Till the head teacher promised she would give reward to the students who is [vp3,8-7] willing to do it in moral education, some one tried to be the first to do.
How weird!
Collective belong [vp3,1-4] to all of us.
Why we haggle over every ounce in serving it?
Some students in our class come from the other class.
We permit they miss the old one, and we absolutely don't permit they look on the new one --- our class as an inn.
They must regard our class as their permanent destianation [fm1,-] .
On the other hand, we make a statement: we welcome everyone to join our class, so long as they [pr3, 10-6] love this collective in the heart, willingly and gladly serve it.
otherwise [fm3,-] they are persona non grata.
Collective cohesion is very important to us.
Having it, we would o on progressing.
Electioneering
This Monday, our head teacher announced that one electioneering about class cadres would be held next week.
this would be a majoy [fm1,-] event in our class's democratic life.
The class cadres have not been changed in general since our new head teacher assumed office.
Some of them discharged their duty all along, but a handful of them was in office only in name .
to [fm3,-] our class, such a special collective, having a group of competent cadres is very important.
I hope this electioneering [fm1,-] will be successful.
The elected cadres must have served all the classmates, led our class to be flourishing [wd3,-] .
Retell the Play.
Professor Hunter was very excited that morning because he had just finished the papers of his invention.
And he was going to give his invention to the government.
But he wasn't strong enough to go to London himself.
So the government sent two men to take the papers.
The men would come at eleven.
Only at half past ten, two men came.
They claimed to be sent by the government.
They looked too nervous and were too anxious to leave.
Professor Hunter was very careful in important things.
He distrusted the two men.
So he gave another papers to them, not the true one.
They accepted, and left in a hurry.
When it was eleven o'clock, the police telephoned that the right men who came from London had been kidnaped [fm1,-] on their way to Professor Hunter's house.
That is to say, the two men who came a moment ago were impostors.
Before long, inspector White and Sergeant Bull came to investigate.
To [pp2,-2] everyone's surprised, Professor Hunter said that it was not necessary to catch that two men.
He explained that the papers that two men had taken was [vp3,10-2] not important... At last, Professor Hunter decided to take the real papers to London himself.
Letter of Accusation.
constitution [fm3,-] [pr1,-] stipulates: "Citizen enjoys criticism, proposal, petition, complaint and accusation right [np6,8-0] .
" Now , I'm going to exercise the right of accusation.
The week before last, when I wanted to add a note about football to the back blackboard, the propagandist unexpectedly extorted one yuan from me for this.
Because he was a bureaucrat, I had to be extorted.
The propagandist have [vp3,2-5] already constituted [cc3,0-3] the blackmail crime.
On the other hand, when the propagandist published stumping [wd3,-1] speech, he said that he would propagate the football gratis.
Now, he have [vp3,1-5] gone back on his word, he have [vp3,1-0] deceived us.
Though the money he extorted is little, the effect is very big.
All of us don't need such a class cadre.
The head teacher must do something to punish the propagandist, in order to stop this kind of thing happening.
f the head teacher were not to give me a reasonable answer or overrule this letter of accusation, I would complain to the school.
At that time, the head teacher will also be a defendant.
Our P.E.
teacher
Our P.E.
teacher calls [vp7,4-3] " Long Sea, Thunder".
He perhaps is in his twenties, but he looks as if he were about forty years old.
hy?
Because his face doesn't match his age.
As he always speaks the common spoken Chinese, we all think that he is a man who comes from another province.
That he is tall and powerful, also shows that he comes from the [wd5, 1-2] North China.
" He gets on well with others, " our head teacher describes our P. E. teacher like this.
Is it right on earth?
Publish opinion will decide which is right and which is wrong.
May our head teacher represent the public?
The answer is clear.
Objective fact can't be denied.
Let us wait and see.
All the students, love our P.E.
teacher, please.
I think you all can do that, because he is really lovely.
Right?
Innocent
Our classmates are very innocent.
They don't know here are many sinister men in the world.
They over [wd7,1-6] believe the people at our side, like the teachers who taught us before.
In the preliminary contest of this Art Festival, several classmates, who took part in it, were deceived and betrayed.
In singing song, three boys was active in practising before the preliminary contest.
They even composed a ci peom [fm1,-] again.
They thought, this must be the capital that they score a success.
They also met Teacher Wu chun pei, one of the judges, in order to enter the finals without a hitch.
Altogether, they thought they were able to enter the 90 per cent sure.
But the result was that they were betrayed by Wu Chunpei, they were sifted out.
In a short, we were deceived by the judges more obviously.
We lost very wrongly.
Our head teacher and we had thought that there could be four programs enter [vp4,5-2] the finals.
But now, only two.
A all into the pit, a gain in your wit.
Let us remember: depend more on ourselves, need no others' giving alms.
Don't be too innocent.
Long long [wd6,-] ago, there was a famous prime minister in China.
he called Wei zheng [vp7,3-0] .
Once, he said to the king of the Tang Dynasty, " I hope you let me be a good subject, not a loyal subject.
" The king asked why he said so.
Wei Zheng replied, " The good subject assists the monarch to administer a country, they get on well with each other, then the monarch will enjoy a good reputation.
the loyal subject is killed by the monarch, because he admonishes the monarch, then the monarch will get a bad reputation.
" Miss in, I hope that you will enjoy a good reputation.
I had ulterior motives to write to the vice-head teacher.
Liang iang ling was taken advantage of.
I expected that he would take the " etter" to you.
I didn't write it only ask for help [,7-0] .
nstead, I wrote it in order to remind you and all the classmates.
Miss Lin, " good advice jars on the ear helps [wd4,6-4] to do things better", do you know?
I know, this " letter" has hurt you greatly, I have gone too far.
Here, I say sorry to you.
At last, I wish you can make unremitting efforts to improve ourself, use your wisdom to lead us.
Why I can succeed in this exam?
I have succeed in this examination doubtless.
Why can I do so?
It is impossible that a student has not pressure [cc1,4-] in the exam.
Being a student in the emphasis class [cc4,1-0] , the pressure [cc3,1-5] I have had is bigger.
Some classmates even think that no pressure is no impetus.
Altogether, the pressure comes from three ways: society, family and school.
Especially is family [,2-0] , because the parents all hope their children will have a bright future.
In this exam, my pressure comes from the teacher mainly.
Before the exam, the head teacher had a talk with me.
She demanded that I should set an example in study to all the boys who like playing football.
From then on, I felt that I had weighty responsibility.
The strong sense of responsibility drove me to study more harder [ad3,1-0] .So the pressure the head teacher gave [cc3,5-5] me helps me to victory.
That is to say, I must tank [wd3,2-1] her.
My Winter Holiday
My winter holiday in 1997 bores me to tears.
I have a bad opinion of it.
I would rather go to school than have holidays.
In these days, I have not a delightful holiday, but a tragic experience.
My winter holiday is very brief, but it enough [ad1,1-3] makes me busy.
Innumerable holiday homeworks [np5,2-0] , preparing the coming new year, preparing the new term ... all of these must be done in thirteen days.
How poor I am!
Free and unrestrained living don't [vp3,4-5] belong to me at all.
Because the heavy study assignment ties me .
Even in the holidays,I am unable to extricate my self from it either.
In short, my winter holiday is dull.
I believe that all the classmates have the same opinion, only the teachers will feel happy in the holiday.
The Spring Festival
Someone thinks that the Spring Festival is a festival for the children.
So I don't get [vp2,2-4] more interest in it as I grow up.
I even find that with the passage of time, the festive air is not warm any more.
But my parents still pay more attention to the Spring Festival.
They buy many potted flowers to decorate our house, such as hyacinth, azalea, chrysanthemum, narcissus and winter daphne.
Some of these flowers feel [cc2,4-1] fragrant, others look very beautiful.
Because it is warm in the winter, the flowers bloom early.
Fortunately my father thinks of a way to prevent the flowers from blooming early, so that they can keep pace with the Spring Festival.
For example he put the narcissus which is going to bloom into the icebox.
Though the Spring Festival is during my winter holiday, I can't be happy to my heart's content, because I have to hurry to do my holiday home works [np5,4-0] .
God save me!
Piece of Good News
On february [fm3,-] the third, I saw a piece of good news in the Yang [fm2,-] Cheng [fm2,-] Evening Paper.
In Tian jin, some teacher did what the students must do all day long; getting to school on time, having several lessons, and so on are the students' school living.
though [fm3,-] they needn't do homework, and needn't support the parents scold, the teachers still felt very tired and made their head swim.
After copying the students' example, the teachers generally said that the students was [vp3,7-4] really tired and suffering.
They also said that the knowledge which the students taught [vp7,-] is dry [aj3,-2] as dust, and needed mechanical memorizing.
Someone even said that if things go on like this, students aren't able to become talents who needs [vp7,7-5] in twenty-first century.
This is a piece of good news, because it can set people thinking, including teachers, parents and educational experts.
And the students seem to keep silent temporarily, because they really have no alternative.
The Petrel Golgi ...
The dark clouds get darker and darker, lower and lower, and press to the sea .
The waves are singing, at the same time, they are rushing to the sky, going to welcome the thunder .
The thunder roars.
The waves shout in the form, ontending with the fierce wind.
Look!
The fierce wind hug [vp3,3-10] layers of billow, and ferociously throw them to the cliff.
The petrel is shouting and flying, like the black lighting.
He flies across the dark clouds like an arrow.
His wing shims over the waves.
Look!
He is dancing in the air, like a spirit --- a supercilious, thunderous spirit.
He is laughing, and he is howling.
He is laughing at the dark clouds.
He is howling because of happiness.
This sensitive spirit, early feels tired in the thunder.
He believes that the dark clouds cannot cover the sun --- YES!
CANNOT COVER.The fierce wind is shouting.
The thunder is roaring.
The dark clouds, like the blue fire, are burning on the bottomless sea.
The sea catches the lightning, and lets them [pr3,7-5] go out in their abyss.
These lightning's shadow, like the burning snakes, is swimming in the sea, soon disappears.
The storm!
The storm is coming!
This is the brave petrel.
He is superciliously flying on the sea, in the lightning.
This is a voice from the successful prophet: LET THE STORM COME MORE VIOLENTLY!
Confrontation.
This week, the grade master have had a special talk with us.
Ten days ago, we had a grade meeting.
In the meeting, the grade master talked about how to manage the relation between boy students and girl students correctly.
She hinted that young students cannot [vp6,5-4] have a love affair.
Though our grade master has really given much thought to the matter, some of my classmates do not agree with her.
They are disgusted with what she said.
On the other hand, the grade master is unhappy after she perceives this.
So she thinks that it is very necessary to talk about this problem to us again.
Last term, we ever troubled the grade master.
At that time, we must hand in 65 yuan before travelling to Xi Qiao [fm2,-] Hill.
But some of us took a sceptical [fm1,-] attitude on handing in so much money.
So the grand aster had to explain to us.
In all fairness, our grade master care [vp3,3-4] for us very much.
But sometimes we would think that she's a busy body.
So we intentionaly [fm1,-] trouble her, too.
The "confrontation" between the grade master and us, shows the universal contradiction between teachers and students.
That is to say, this "confrontation" is normal.
Talk
the [fm3,-] confrontation Again.
In last week's English composition, chen zhi jie wrote an article to appraise what our grade master had done through discussion.
He regarded the grade master as a tiger which [pr5,8-7] didn't let boys or girls love together.
His words were extreme, and the head master prevented him from continuing his article in time, but I found that some classmates thought highly of the article after they had read it.
what did his [pr4,2-1] mean?
Last term, Chen ever told me such a thing: The grade master had a talk with him for one sentence on the blackboard newspaper.
She thought that Chen censured the school for doing injustice through that sentence.
Chen was baffled.
From then on, the relationship between the grade master and Chen turned bad.
So it isn't strange that he regarded her as a tiger this time.
I have not been for Chen all along, including this time.
But, since so many classmates agree with him, one of our class cadres, I must remind the head teacher that something will be done by them before long.
Remember, the world relongs [fm1,-] to them and me.
Tired
It is at a quarter past six on Monday morning that I writer [wd2,1-2] this arcticle [fm1,-] .
Only five hours ago, I still did my homework in the lamplight.
That is to say, I have been [vp6,2-8] asleep for five hours in the past evening.
In fact, on Saturday evening and Sunday day and night, I few [wd2,-] stopped writing, few [wd3,-] left my house for a walk.
I wrote and wrote, but it seems that the homework cannot be finished for ever.
Since the new term began, the time that I spent on problems and home work was more than that I had a rest---the necessary rest.I always go to bed late at night, and get up much earlier than any [wd5,14-1] others.
So I am very tired now.
I don't know when the days like this will end.
Perhaps no end .
After the unified state examination, something else must wait for me.
I have to suffer hardships again... Now, it is a quarter to seven, I have to hurry to school with my weary body.
Understand Each Other
Why the students do not all agree with what their teacher said?
Why do they sometimes get on badly with their teacher?
I think it is because the students and their teacher have different opinions.
For example, some boys like playing football, because they all think they can enjoy themselves from it.
on [fm3,-] the other hand, their teacher don't [vp3,2-4] let them play football in most of their spare time.
Because their teacher think [vp3,2-0] that this will affect their study .
I think these two opinion [np6, 2-0] are all [pr6,6-1] right.
In fact, everyone must have his unique opinion.
And his opinion cannot be changed easily.
If one can't do these, it seems that he is a puppet.
This kind of man who is easily manipulated by others is not useful.
After either the students or their teacher knows this piece of reason, what they can only do is understand [vp4,6-2] each other.
One of them must think that he himself is reasonable, and others are right, too.
Harmful Slogan
There is a slogan that " We're always the BEST" on our class badge.
It has done great harm to us.
Such a slogan, like the opium, puzzled and poison [vp6,8-9] some of our classmates since it came into being.
From then on, we made few preparations for struggling.
We believed that we were really the best and no one could triumph over us.
We slacked off in our studies.
In short, we have lost much because of this slogan.
Though this slogan is seldom talked of by us now, it has already taken root among [wd3,5-3] our hearts deeply.
We must hurry to annul this slogan in order to let all of us realize ourselves correctly.
When we do so, we are full of hope of success.
Streamline Administration.
Our class cadre is [vp6,3-2] too many.
When they have a meeting outside the classroom, they often make great noise.
Because they sometimes have different ideas .
I dare not say that some cadres are unfit for their office.
But s a public, I find that some of them are very at ordinary times [wd7,10-0] .
They usually care more for themselves than for others.
They are not arctive [fm1,-] in helping the students whose study is not very good.
perhaps they think that their study will get bad if they do more work for the people.
And it is clear that they find no good ways to manage the class.
On the other hand, some of the cadres made [vp6,4-2] mistakes recently.
For example, the propagandist was ever scolded by the head teacher because of his extolling freedom of speech.
This week, our monitor is also scolded for he plays basketball till night.
The head teacher has to give a lot of care to manage the cadres.
Here, I suggest streamlining administration.
My New Friend
Wu Zhi cong is my new friend.
Both of us were born in the year of the monkey.
He is the youngest boy in our class.
Do you know why I made friends with him?
Cong looks innocent and lively because he is young.
At ordinary times, when I get along with other classmates, I find there is a strong smell of gun powder among us.
Some of the classmates have already fought for the study in a terrible fix.
The have already been the fighting machines.
I believe Cong and I wouldn't be like them.
Perhaps youth is our capital.
We can deal with our study and daily life correctly.
Getting along with him, I feel very happy.
I also find that some of his characters is [vp3,4-2] as mine.
So I decide to make friends with him.
Wu Zhing cong is a clever fat boy, and I'm a boy who is full of worry.
We must help each other.
I wish our friendship will endure as the universe.
Homeland
The People's Republic of China lies in the east of Asia and to the west of the Pacific.
Her area is nine million ix hundred thousand square kilometres.
So our homeland is the largest country in the [wd5,7-1] Asia, and one of the largest countries in the world.
There are more than one point two billion people in our homeland.
She's a unitary multi-national state.
Her terrain is tall in the west and low in the east.
The topography is complicated.
Our country has rich minecals [fm1,-] , aquatic resources, natural forests and water power resources.
Our homeland is very beautiful.
As the time goes on, she gets stronger and stronger.
Just then, the Chinese people can live and work in peace and contentment.
Now, we are working hard for this object.
Our homeland's tomorrow must be better.
Walk.
On May the second, some of our classmates went to visit the Bai yun Hill.
When they descended the hill, they choose [vp6,6-3] a wrong way, o that they had to walk a long way.
This made them went back home late and tired [,8-0] .
After the event, the head teacher also admitted that she had never walked such a long way in her life.
But she thought it is [vp3,4-2] a challenge.
Yes, her view is right.
That is why I am glad to walk more than four kilometres to go to school each day.
now [fm3,-] , I am good at walking even a very long way.
In fact, when I am not happy, I will go out for a long walk.
Wandering in the street, I will forget the unhappy matter.
I can say in pride if I had walked the same way with those classmates that day, I would not feel [vp8,15-11] tired, and I could urge them to walk faster and faster.
But walking too long will do harm to us.
It will cause the accident damage to us, like wound the ligament [fm1,-] and feet .
Let's go on walking, and every step leaves its print.
Let's walk as fast as we can, so that we can pursue the sun --- the brilliantest [fm1,-] victory.
But, don't choose the wrong way again.
A Pair of Special Playing Cards.
When I was in Senior one [fm3,-] , I often took photos of my classmates.
For examply [fm1,-] , even on the day when school opened, I took photos of them, in order to cause them to notice me.
And after the photos were developed and printed, I would give the photos to each character [wd3,7-0] .As three months were past, I had already taken photos of them three times, and I had gathered more than one hundred pictures.
Then I chose fifty- four ones [pr6,5-2] from them, and made these photos into a pair of playing cards.
This pair of playing cards were very expensive.
Altogether I spent more than ninty [fm1,-] yuan on them.
They were also of great value--- commemorative value.
I will keep this pair of special playing cards well for ever.
Broken Arms In the last two weeks, several matters about basketball have [vp6,9-4] happened in our class.
It made our head teacher very angry that some classmates cared m ore for playing basketball than studying.
But, does she notice that some of the class cadres are connected with these matters.
First, on one Tuesday evening, some classmates even played basketball on the playground till half past nine.
It was Feng Yu jing that took part in it, too.
When they saw the head master coming, Feng fled the fastest on his bike.
Finally, he has also been caught.
Several days later, two cadres, Liang jia chao and Mai Zirui made the same mistake.
It was more disgusting that they led some boys who don't [vp3,10-10] belong to the No.4 Middle School into our school.
These three cadres have already made self-criticisms facing the classmates.
Since the cadres made the same mistake continuously, it is not strange that ordinary students wouldn't obey the rule.
This must be said that " when those above behave unworthily [fm1,-] , those below will do the same [pr2,15-0] .
" As we know, the class cadres are the arms of the head teacher's.
Now, the arms are broken.
This will do harm to the headmaster and all of us!
Dear head teacher, LOOK OUT!
<SEX 2> <Y 7> <AGE ?> <DIC 2> <TYP 1> <WAY 2> <Title A GOOD TEACHER-STUDENT RELATIONSHIP> <SCORE 6> <SCH HENAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY> A good teacher-student relationship [np5,-] is based on respect.
Teacher [np6,-] must respect [wd4,-] student's request [np6,-] and choise [fm1,-] .
When students require teacher [np6,-] to give more out-book-knowledge [fm2,-] , teacher [np6,-] should try to add it in class.
And after class, students can [vp9,-] do their hobby [np6,-] [vp2,-] as they like while teacher can't [vp9,-] stand in their way.
The student should, in turn, respect teacher [np6,-] .
For example, when teacher [np6,-] try to satisfy [wd3,-] students, students should listen carefully and gain something from it.
When teacher [np6,-] gives students chance [np6,-] to do what they like [vp1,-] , students should try their best and do it well.
A good teacher-student relationship [np5,-] is also based on mutual understanding.
Let's suppose that if students don't do the work as [wd4,-] teacher's request [np6,-] , teacher [np6,-] should make it [wd5,-] clear the reason so that teacher [np6,-] won't wrong students.
On other hand, if teacher [np6,-] criticize students wrong [wd2,-] , students should know [wd3,-] teacher [np6,-] only wants them to study well.
By this way a good teacher-student relationship [np5,-] is built up.
There is a saying, Haste makes waste, in old times.
It suggests that if you want to achieve something quickly, however [wd3, -s] you always can not get it.
One of the reasons is that the everything in the world has its own regularity.
We have to comply with it and can not change it.
The national economic also has its own regularity.
In previous time [np6, 2-] , China wanted keenly to reach communisty [fm1,-] society early.
However, it have [vp3, 1-] made our national economic [wd2, 2-] develop slowly, and to some extents [wd3, 2-] , it did harm to [vp1, 1-4] our national economic's [fm2,-] development.
Today our government adopted the open and reform policy.
Our national economic [wd2, 2-] become [vp3, 3-] apparently better than ever.
The people's living conditions are much improved.
The people's educational level rised.
 [fm2,-] 
That haste makes waste is known to everyone in China.
Whatever we do, we must remember it.
There are some reason [np3, 1-] for it.
First, when someone is haste [wd2,-] , he hasn't enough time to think what he should do and how he should do.
So it will cause somebody does [vp1, 2-] what he needn't do.
Then he will waste his time and get nothing.
On the other hand, haste makes people not know [wd1, 2-] how to do .
So people will do everything.
But [wd3, -s] all will reach nothing.
Second, haste will make people's mood bad.
When someone is in bad mood, he willn't [fm2,-] do a good thing, so what he has do [vp9, 1-] will be waste.
For example, studing [fm2,-] English can't haste [wd2,-] .
If someone is hurry [vp9,1-] to make his English level [wd5, 1-] progress fastly [fm2,-] .
He don't [vp3, 1-] begin from base and willn't [fm2,-] learn English well.
When someone is filling a bottle with water, and he is impatient, so [wd3, -s] he makes [wd3,s-] it quickly but most of the water is [wd3, -2] dropped out of the bottle.
Obviously he needs more time and becomes slower .
Like this, we call, Haste makes waste.
Then, why do [vp3, -s] haste makes [vp9, 2-] waste.
Firstly, I think, haste can makes [vp9,1-] people upset, and then influence his [pr3, s-] acts.
Secondly, once people haste [wd2,1-1] , he [pr3, s-] can not control his activeness [fm2,-] well and does things in wrong ways.
For instance, someone is haste [wd2,-] to get train [cc3, 1-] .
The time is rather limited, so he is upset, he takes his suitcase [wd4, s-] hurried to the railway station.
When he arrives at the station, he finds his ticket is forgotten [wd3, s-] in his home.
Such examples are many.
And in order to avoid it [pr1, s-] and make things good and quick, we should not haste and we ought to make calme.
 [fm1,-] [cc3, 1-] 
A proverb says "haste makes waste".
It says very well.
Every thing has its own way.
Someone wants to do well in it [pr1, s-] , he must grasp the principles which are in the things.
It should take [vp1, -s] man for a long time to understand it [pr1, -] .For example: a man wants to master a foreign language.
It is impossible for him to study well in one month.
Regulerly [fm1,-] learning and reviewing is important to [wd3,s-] learn language.
Finally, he will find that he can apply it [pr1, s-] easily.
For another instance: you want to be a singer .
You should get up early and practise singing every day.
Only keep on practising for a long time, you will make a greater progress.
It needs patience and persistence in doing a thing.
In my opinion: no pains, no gains.
It is impossible for a man do well [wd1,1-] things in few [np8, -1] time.
There is a famous say [wd2, 2-] that haste makes waste.
In short, if one wants to finish his work as possible as he can, he will make the work even worse on the contrary [wd5,s-] .
There are many reasons that we can be found [vp7, 3-] make out [wd3, s-] .
First, if a unskilled [wd3, -1] man set [vp3, 2-] out to do some difficult work, and he is asked to finish [vp1, -] in a short time, he will be nevous [fm1,-] .
As a result, he can finish it on time.Second, one must do things in turn, then he can finish them succefully [fm1,-] .
Thinking a man do [vp5, -s] things without his rule, you can know that the sooner he wants to be, the more slowly he does it .
Finally, if someone hasn't been good [ad2, 2-1] prepared for the work, he can't do it succefully [fm1,-] .
That is to say, one must make things well-equipped [cc3, 2-] before he starts to do [vp1, -] .
In my opinion, the famous saying is a good advice to us.
We must do things in [wd3,-3] a good step.
Take it easy, as long as you are skilled and well-equipped person [np6,3-] .
You will succeed.
"Haste makes waste" is a principle.
If you hurry to do something, you can't do it well.
Perhaps, you run into these case [np3, 1-] [cc3, 3-] .
For example the ring strikes, but you can't find your book, so you look for it.
Upside down [wd3, 1-] the room, but can't found it .
When you stop to think for a while, you possibly find it easily.
For another example, studying English is a good one.
When you want to remember the words in the dictionary in several days, but [wd5, -s] the result of which is that you only remember few [wd3, -] .
The two example [np3, 1-] I list both ellustrate [fm1,-] the principle.
So it [pr2, -s] could be concluded [vp7, 2-] that [vp1, s-] .
It isn't a good way to do something in a hurry.
You should do it patiently and slowly, which will help you to get what you want.
As a proverb say [vp3, 2-] : Haste Makes Waste.
It's quite clear that a haste people [np3,2-] [cc4, 1-] can't make achievement because he [pr3, s-] hasn't prepared enough.
It [pr2, -s] is known to all of us.
No one can deny the proverb.
Haste makes waste.
For example: a very young baby, as we all know, can't walk very well.
He walks slowly.
He throws himself to the ground now and then.
However, his mother let [vp3, 2-] him run to her.
He can't reach to [vp1, 1-] her without any help.
Every one learns to walk in childhood.
No one can deny [vp1, -s] it cost him many time [np8, 1-] to walk well, much more time to run.
From the above we can conclude that without preparing can't make a success.
I have the opinion that haste makes waste.
So we should think it [pr1, s-] over before we begin it [pr1, s-] .
Don't you think so?
There is a famous saying "Haste makes waste".
But why?
There are some reasons for that.
First, we have no time thinking about the thing, before we start to do it because of haste.
Second, sometimes we have to do it again because of the lackless [fm2,-2] of care.
Third, it may take us much more time to do a thing with haste than do it carefully.
Finally, we would waste a lot of time and money because of haste.
For example, when we go to school, we would bring the book and other thins [wd3, -] such as glasses.
But we forget to bring the glass before [wd3, -] of haste.
We have to return home for it.
For another example, we haste [vp1, -3] do the thing again when we did [vp6, s-] it wrong.
In a word, we should do a thing careful [wd2, 3-] and think about it before we start to do it.
We usually hear [vp1, -s] that someone say to another men "Haste Make Waste".
But why they say "Haste Makes Waste"?
there [fm3,-] are some reasons for it [pr1, s-] .
The [wd5,-1] first, when you have a good haste [vp2, 3-] to do something, you will have a short time to consider the other fact that will effect the thing.
So when you finish the work, you will find the consequence is not good.
It [pr2, -s] will not [vp7, -s] satisfied to yourself and others.
Second, if you have a good haste, but the other conditions can't keep up with [wd3, 3-1] you, so you must stop to wait.
To the first [pp1,2-] , it will cause you must do it again .
To the second [pp1,2-] , it will cause you spent your time in waiting .
So the two ways [wd7, 4-2] is [vp3, 2-] waste.
For example, it will have a [np7, -1] examination.
A student found [wd4, -s] he have [vp3,1-] many books not to read.
So he decided to have a quick look on [wd3,3-3] all the books.
So [wd5, -s] he will have much time.
But he don't [vp3, 1-] understand it, or he don't [vp3, 1-] catch the main point to read.
So [wd5, -s] when he get [vp3, 1-] the paper, he will find that many knowledge [np8, 1-] have being seen [vp9,2-] .
But [wd5, -s] he didn't [vp6, s-] do it because he didn't understand it.
So he waste [vp3, 1-] the time.
We can say [vp1, -s] him "Haste makes waste".
People always say "Haste makes waste".
It means that you do everything should [vp1,-s] step by step , then you can get succed [fm1,-] .
It's just like a baby, before he is able to run fast, he must learn how to walk slowly, or he will fall down and hurt himself.
For example, it's the same in learning language [np6, 1-] .
First, the student learn [vp3,2-] the letters, then words, at last, he know [vp3, 1-] how to use them to make a sentence and an article [cc3, 5-] .
During the course, the learner must work very hard, master everything he needs, such as the words, the programmer [wd3, -] and so many things.
He must [vp9, -s] very patient and has [vp9, 4-] a specific aid.
He may feel exhausted but he must keep on learning.
Finally, he master [vp3,1-] it.
Everyone needs time to learn.
Maybe you are clever, but you can not accomplish a task without working hard.
If you do it too fast, you may make mistakes though [wd3, -s] you haven't think [vp9,1-] about it carefully.
If unfortunately [wd1, -s] you go too far from the right way, it will be very difficult to correct your mistakes.
You do everything need enough preparation and good fundamental [wd2, 1-] .
Then you can complete it in no trouble.
Please remember "haste makes waste".
One proverb says: "Haste makes waste".
Why say so?
It goes as following.
First, haste makes mistakes.
If you want to finish one thing quickly you might be very nervous.
You think of the consequence when you are doing it.
Then you will find that your former [wd3, -2] flexible fingers become dull [wd3, s-] and the mind is [vp9, -3] seemed to be stupid.
Maybe you will go out of the door to find that the key is without [wd3, -] you.
Second, haste makes inefficient.
When you are in nervous [wd2, 1-] , you can do anything but success [cc3, 3-] .
So we say "Haste makes waste".
The examples we can easily found [vp9, 2-] in our life.
Imagine that you have a date [wd3, 2-] and you are nearly to be late.
You may quickly make up and rush out, but finally you find that you forget to ask the address of your friend.
How embarrassed it [pr1, s-] is!
For students it is common.
When final exams comes [vp3, 1-] , we should prepare all the lessons, we will skim all the books but don't know which one we should take first.
In conclusion, haste makes a person nervous and then easily makes mistakes.
So "Haste makes waste".
There is a saying in China that "Haste makes waste".
It is correct to say so.
Some people may don't [vp9, 1-] think so.
But the saying is reasonable.
When we are in a hurry, we may remember one thing but forget another thing.
We're so hasty that we can't do things well.
Because we are in hasty [wd2, 1-] , we have a press [wd3, 2-] , we can't do well at last.
Everyone may happened [vp9, 1-] [wd3, 3-3] to such a situation.
You'll be late for school in the morning.
So you get up quickly and eat breakfast quickly.
When you leave home in the end, you may find that you go out without the bag [wd3, -] .
It is the haste that make [vp3, 2-] [vp1, -s] you have to go back home.
It is certain that you are late for school.
What [wd3, -s] you do quickly is only to waste your time.
There are many examples about how haste makes waste in the daily life.
We may take these lessons.
Otherwise, all that we do only lead [vp3,5-] to waste.
It is not what we wish.
"Haste makes waste" is a probe [wd3, -] in China.
The words is [vp3, 2-] reasonable and popular in our daylife.
 [fm1,-] When you have a task to do.
And want to do it well.
You should know how difficult the task is, and which kinds of things you should do.
A task also [wd1, -1] may have some details you should remarkable [wd3, -] .
But you want to do the job very quickly, neglect the details, ignore the circumstance when [wd3, s-] you complete the task, perhaps many things you haven't done.
Perhaps a task consist [vp3, 2-] of several parts.
After [pp1, -1] complete all the parts you complete the task.
But [wd5, -s] perhaps you want to "Haste" [wd4, -s] you do this part and forget that part.
And the task is never complete [wd3, -] .
A job have [vp3, 2-] some fundamental factors [wd3, -] .
You only want to "haste", forget to do the fundamental factor.
Only do the main factor.
Perhaps you should do nothing.
Just like [vp1, -1] study English.
We study English from A, B,C, to make sentence [np6, 2-] to write article.
 [np6, 1-] We should learn the idiom and grammar.
If you only learn some word and want to read the newspaper or make a sentence or write article.
You want to learn the English quickly, forget the fundamental factors.
The sentences you made is wrong and you can't understand the newspaper, and it's difficulty to write article [np6, 2-] .
Only [wd5, -s] you learn many idioms and grammar, and speak and write English every day.
You can learn the English well.
Do anything well you should do fundamental job first, then do the main part of the thing.
You should do it well.
We all know this sentence "haste makes waste".
It means if a man wants to get the result fastly, maybe the fast leads to the unceccess [fm1,-] .
There are many examples to explain "haste makes waste".
Why we say so?
At first, everything has its natural proceed [wd3, s-] , we must obey it and should not surpass it.
Only [wd5, -s] we have done it step by step, we can succeed.
For example, when we study English, we should study the word, firstly it is the primary [wd3, -] of the [wd5, -] language.
Then we should study the grammar, then to read text [np6, 1-] and do exercise [np6, 1-] .
Such as [wd5, -s] when we have passed CET4 we can attend the test CET6.
If we want get a good mark, we must study it [pr1, s-] step by step.
Sencondly [fm1,-] , the more we do things fastly, [ad3, s-] the more mistakes or dangers will be [vp9, 1-1] appear.
For a [np7, -1] instance, if we drive a car to a place, we should obey the trafic [fm1,-] rules, otherwise we may get in trouble.
The accident will waste our time then we can't get there on time.
So we must remember it---haste makes waste.
It teaches us that we should obey the natural rules and consider our situation when we do anything.
Every one want [vp3, 2-] to succeed.
But in fact you will always get a bad result if you act too eagerly.
Every one knows that haste make [vp3, 1-] waste.
But when you are in a competition, you will think: "oh, I must do the work better than her (him), I must also [wd4, -s] faster than her (him), faster and faster...." So you may [wd4, -s] in a fuss [wd3, s-] .
Everything you want to do well, but everything is not under your control.
Because you are so earger [fm1,-] that you can't think over the whole thing correctly.
So you will fail in the end.
This is the reason why haste makes waste.
I remember one day when I am [vp6, -s] studying in a middle school.
It was 12 o'clock already and I wanted to have the lunch prepared half an hour later [wd5, -] before my mother went back.
So I turned up the oven firstly, then looked for the salt.
But no matter how anxious I was, I couldn't find the salt and other useful thing.
At last, I could do nothing but turn off the oven in case it would be on fire.
Everything was worse than I could expect.
Form then on, I knew that haste makes waste and that if you want to succeed, you should do everything after you have think [vp9, 1-] it over.
In China there is a proverb: Haste makes waste.
It is [vp9, -1] means: if you want something to be done quickly, however, it would be [vp9, 2-2] work slowly; if you want to make something done better, but [wd5, -s] it would be worse.
Why people are [vp9,-1] think of haste [vp5, -2] makes waste?
The reason is that, when someone plans to do something, he always hopes to be done [vp7, s-] excessfully [fm1,-] and eagerly, which is [vp9, -s] cause to waste [vp5, -3] time and hard [wd3, -] .
For example, in winter, students are [vp9, -2] get up late.
Because we are too late to catch the class [cc3, 2-] on time, so we want to how to quickly to save our time .
We may hurry to carry our books and notes to the classroom, but when we reach the classroom, we would find the pen left [wd4, -2] [vp7, 2-] the dormitory, or we would find we got the notes wrong [wd1, 1-] .
This is an [np7, -2] good example of [pp1,-3] haste makes waste.
In order to avoid of [wd5, -3] haste makes waste, we should do anything repairely [fm1,-] , we should not wonder [vp1,-1] the result but wonder the efficient [wd3, -] .
So, we can do everything well than [wd7, -s] haste makes waste.
Every student want [vp3, 2-] to master the knowledge in [pp1, -1] soon, but, it is only a daydream.
Study is a long course that need [vp3, 2-] people's continuing hard work and to spend plenty of time .
Understanding one article, firstly, you must master mostly words and be able to know the means [wd3, -3] of every sentence.
When you do well [wd1, -s] all kinds of basic work, you may understand an article.
For example, we will climb a hill.
It's impossible for us to stand on the top of hill at once, we must climb step by step, aimed at the top of hill and worked hard.
Through continuing effort, the top became nearer, the distance that we have walked is longer and longer.
At last, we get the aim or exchang [fm1,-] [wd7, -5] with time and our energy.
So, it's a rule of nature to [wd3, -3] haste make waste.
Someone think [vp3, 1-] it's very efficient that you spend little time doing things better.
Sometimes it's right, but sometimes it's wrong.
That haste makes waste is a phenomenon.
Because you want to save time to do something, so [wd5, -s] you're always want [vp9,2-] to escape doing something.
But it's very unfortunately [wd2, 2-] , the something [wd3, 1-] which you want to escape is just very important part of something which [wd5, 1-2] you'll do.
So at last you not only don't finish this matter [wd3, -] , but also you spend more time.
For instance, we are in line [wd3, 1-] to buy tickets of [wd3, 3-] movie.
But there are some people [wd4, 2-5] don't keep in the line, they crash [wd3, -3] to the front [wd3,s-] .
They don't want to waste time in the line and they want to buy good tickets.
The outcome of these action [np3, 1-] is that more and more people are crowded to buy tickets.
Finally, they don't buy good tickets but they spend more time to go out of the crowded people.
It's a trivial thing in my life.
But I can learn about the rule "Haste makes waste".
So I think when you dicide [fm1,-] to do something, you'd better finish it step by step.
Everyone should know about the ancient Chinese saying: "Haste makes waste".
It means that if you want to achieves success at once, you would fail probably.
Maybe someone can't understand [vp1, -] and asks why it is.
Now, let me tell you the reason.
I'll show you examples in order to make you understand.
Do you hear of the story about "Jin attacks Song".
In ancient time [np6, 1-] , Jin country [wd3, 1-] wanted attack Song country [wd3, 1-] .
The leader ordered a soildier to make marks the day before they studied [wd3, s-] .
But in that night, it rained.
Someone persuaded the leader to give up the attack.
But the leader sticked [fm2,-] [wd3,-] to do [vp5, 2-] what he wanted.
So they started.
As a result, they can't [vp6,-] find the marks which they [wd5, s-] had been destroyed by the flood [wd3, s-] .
They were defeated.
From the story, we can know that if you want to achieve your target [cc3,2-] , you must think of all factors.
Only considering the speed is not appropriate.
If you want to become singer [np6, 1-] , you should practise [vp1,-] everyday and ask for [vp2, -2] music teacher who will lead you to the true way [cc4,1-] .
Each success includs [fm1,-] [wd3, -2] hard work.
No pains, no gains.
Only with words you can't get to the bank of success.
We must work hard and advance step by step.
On the road of success, there is no easy [wd3, -] .
Our motherland needs [vp1, -3] all us to work hard for her.
The prospect of our country is beautiful.
Let us use our own hands to create our tomorrows [wd3,-] .
Please remember "haste makes waste.
" Doing everything , you should look before you leap.
An old saying has it that haste makes waste.
If you want to do something, you should do it step by step.
And if you want to fasten your speed, you do it quickly, then maybe you'll find that you have missed something.
So [wd5, -s] you have to do it again.
And it takes you more time.
In daily life, we often meet with such things.
So when I was a little girl, my parents and teachers often thought [wd3, -4] me to be cautious.
"When you are doing your work", they said, "you must engage in it and most important, you must be careful!
" For individual, I think it may be not [wd1, 2-] a serious thing, but if you are in a high position and change of some important things or a lot of money.
Haste will lost [vp9, 1-] [wd3, -2] you much and may lost [wd3, -] your company, your country much .
Once our English teacher told me a story.
Long ago there was a young man who wanted to enter the city with his servent [fm1,-] .
They are [vp6, s-] in a boat.
 [wd4,-2] Sun was coming down so he fastened [wd3, -5] the owner of the boat, an old man.
The old man told him slowly, "If you don't fasten [wd3, -1] me I can sent [vp9, 1-] you in [wd3,-] the city before the gate closing.
If you fasten [wd3, -] , I think I can't do it.
" The young man didn't believe him, so the old man fastened [wd3, -2] his boat.
Suddenly, the bunches of books scattered and in the end, the young man couldn't enter the city.
And this is the meaning of the old saying "Haste makes waste".
We should learn from it and do things cautiously, step by step.
In solving a problem or doing a job, all factors are doing [cc2,2-2] its [pr3, 3-] work.
Time is very important.
If you only try to hurry up, a lot of factors may be forgotten or pay not much attention to .
So there is a saying "Haste makes waste.
" For instance, during the preparation for the CET 6, because I have sailed [wd3, -] through the CET 4, so [wd5, -s] I thought it was just a piece of cake.
I have not read a single word until May.
Then [wd5, -s] I tried to memorize every word in the dictionary in such a short time.
Needless to say, I have failed.
Even if I studied [wd3,-] hundreds of words [cc3, 3-] each day, when I was reading, the words that I have seen still be unknown to me.
Only did I know the saying or another "Rome was not built in a day" was the time when I was being tested !
Many people think haste makes success.
But in [pp1, -1] true, haste make waste.
For example, we want a good marks [np3, 2-] in the test.
We couldn't learn some course in some [wd3, -1] day.
We must learn it for half a year and even more.
So [wd5, -s] , we can master it well and do it well.
So [wd5, -s] we can say haste makes success is impossible .
Success need [vp3, 1-] time, and energy.
Otherwise, haste makes waste.
On the other hand, if we want success at once.
So [wd5, -s] we must have good basis.
Where the basis comes from?
It comes from we learn some course from high school to [wd3, -] university.
We do exercise, learn to speak, write and so on.
If we never do these before, how could we do a thing successfully and rapidly.
So [wd5,-s] I can say if you want success quickly, you need basis [wd3, -] , energy and time.
You should learn everything which will benefit [vp1, -1] to you, to do some work in society.
In a word, we want success rapid [wd2, s-] , we need basis [wd3, -] and knowledge , otherwise [wd4, -s] , haste makes waste.
It is obvious [wd4,-s] most of persons have their own views.
On the one hand, some people go in for doing a kind of job all through their lives.
There are someone [wd4,-1] reasons: some people may go in for the work; some people think it was the only work that they can do best; other people may be afraid of unemployment after they give up the origine [fm1,-] work.
On the other hand, some people like changing jobs frequently.
Most of them want to learn well in every fields [np3,1-] .
Nowdays [fm1,-] , technology is improving [vp1,s-] quickly.
It calls for people to master it through practicing.
Many people are unemployed for the lack of technology.
In brief, it is the society that call [vp3,1-] for people changing their work.
In my opinion, we can learn something through changing jobs, so I agree to change [vp5,2-] jobs.
We are fit for more jobs.
When one grows up, he must face up to work.
And which job is [vp9,-2] he like?
Why he usually change [vp3,2-] his job?
I think that different people have different views.
Some people like working on [wd3,1-] a certain job.
Because they have been used to these jobs which have made them master some skills.
At the same time, they get on well with their workmates [fm2,-] .
They wouldn't like to make new friends again at [wd3,-2] other company.
And it'll take them some time to adapt [vp1,-s] to new environment [np6,1-] .
So they dislike to change jobs.
Otherwise [wd3,-s] , some people like changing jobs constantly.
They think that different jobs can make them know more skills and people.
And they can do many things to avoid losing job [np6,1-] .
They may hold many opportunities to develop their specialization, learn new knowledge, and so on.
My view on job-hopping is that I may usually change my job until I'm satisfied with it.
And I can do well.
In general, I like stable job [np6,1-] .
In these days, we may change our jobs constantly for all kinds of reasons.
But do people like it [pr1,s-] ?
Here are some news [np5,2-] .
Someone like [vp3,1-] [vp1,1-2] do one job all along.
They think that doing one job for long time, they may get lots of experience from it and do it better and better.
More important is that workmates [fm2,-] are familiar to each other.
However, someone change [vp3,1-] their jobs constantly.
They think that only do many jobs, can they find which one they like most and they may have more skills, meet more people and know more.
I think if you like your jobs.
You may go on with it [pr3,s-] , it is good for your future.
If you disgust it, you may change it and look for better ones.
But be careful, you must do everything from the very beginning when you get a new one.
Nowdays [fm1,-] most of us like to work.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to go in for a stationary work, while others like to change their jobs at one time.
I wonder why they have the different choice.
Someone tend [vp3,1-] to do a simlar [fm1,-] job.
They think that they can get many experience.
They just like to have a stationary condition, they also consider that they have to do a simlar [fm1,-] job because of studying something.
Someone hold [vp3,1-] the contrary idea, ie.
they like to do a unsimlar [fm2,-] job at the unsimlar [fm2,-] time.
They like chanllege.
They think they can get some unsimilar [fm2,-] experience.
They like high salary.
They like to change their work surrounding....
In my view, I like to change my job, but not too often.
I think I can do one job for five years, and then change my job to do other job eg.
to do some business or ad.
 [fm1,-] Because I like business, but not like science to study.
Many people want to take up job [np6,1-] unchanged through their life.
For example, my father has worked as a worker in a factory for twenty five years, and he is still loving his job.
Usually, people want to take unchanged job [np6,1-] for such reasons: they enjoy their own job; they want to live stable life [np6,1-] ; they want to be more skilled in their job.... Of couse [fm1,-] , some people do not want to change their job only because they are afraid of not finding a new job.
While, other people like to change their job frequently.
Some of them are always unsatisfied with their job, the others, especially young staff may change their job for this reason, they want to live adventering [fm1,-] life, want to experience new life.
In my view, to a young man, more experience to various jobs will be helpful to enhance his composition [wd3,1-] , and will benefit [vp1,-1] to his capability to adapting [vp5,1-] new circumstance.
But we must be seriously [wd2,-] when we decide to change our job.
And, as soon as we take up a job, in spite of our enjoying, we should try our best to do it well, and try to be more and more skilled in our own job.
Some people like doing the same job from begin [wd2,1-2] to end.
Because they have one ideal in usual.
For example, one person' ideal is becoming a doctor, and now he is a doctor.
Then, he will do the same job for ever.
Some people like doing the same job, also because they like stabling [wd3,1-] .
Perhaps, the job is not very satisfacting [fm2,-] , but they will do it for ever, because they don't like always changing their jobs.
However, some people like changing their jobs from time and [pp2,2-1] time.
Because they feel doing the same job is dulling [fm2,-] .
After a long time, they will feel the job is not interesting.
They like changing jobs very often.
In new enviornment [fm1,-] , they can find a lot of interesting things.
I think, the two kinds of people have a different characters [np3,2-] .
Everyone has different life style.
Some people like doing the same job, and others like changing their job very often.
I think we have not enough reason to say good or bad.
Some people always like taking on a kind of [wd3,2-] job.
In general, there are two reasons first, they enjoy the job very much, or they are interested in the job.
They may specialize in the major about job [np6,1-] on campus.
After graduation, they want to go further into study.
Second, After they start to work, as times [wd3,1-] pass, they are proficiency [wd2,2-] in the job gradually.
They are [vp9,-1] worried that there are some difficulties once they change the job.
Some people often like changing the job.
They may like the challenging work style.
They always can be confidence [wd2,-] in overcoming the obstacles in the jobs.
They want to learn more knowledge and work experiences so, they can sum up the experience so as to acheive [fm1,-] great success.
My view on job-hopping is that I can always take on a kind of job if I can apply for a proper job.
But I think we youth should take on a challenging job, we have encourage [wd3,1-] and ability to adapt [vp1,-1] to the change of scientity [fm1,-] .
After we accumulate the work [cc3,2-] , experiences, we may select [vp1,-1] to the interesting job.
Furthermore, we may have a good command of job.
Meanwhile, we should grab the chance to train ourselves and to improve ourselves.
Maybe for the purpose of making a living, almost everyone must work for society so that he can earn enough money needed by him.
But it is diffirent [fm1,-] from some persons to others about Job-Hopping [fm3,-] .
some think it is better to do the same job all the time.
They believe that for one thing, the longer you practice it the better you do, likewise, others think it is better to change your job constantly.
They consider that the convert [wd3,1-1] job will bring you a fresh sense, thus you can find our potential energy constantly.
It seem [vp3,1-] to be reasonable for both the views.
But I think parts of the two view [np3,1-] are right, and parts wrong.
It [pr1,-s] has diffirent [fm1,-] traits from person to person, some persons with these traits will suit [vp1,-1] for [pp1,-3] do the same job all along, but some persons with those traits will suit [vp1,-1] for the changes work.
So we must analyze own characteristics when we choose our jobs.
Some people like to do one work all the time.
Because some of them like the work that they do really [wd5,s-] , they decide to devote themselies [fm1,-] to the work.
But some of them just don't want to lost [vp5,1-] the work to do another, they do it not for [wd3,1-] they like it.
Some people like to change works often.
Because they like challenge, they want to proved [vp5,1-] that they can do any work if they like.
And they can do the work well as they do before.
But some just don't like the work they do and they can't do any work for a long time, so they change the work often.
My view on job-hopping is the first view of the two is right.
Because the characteries [fm1,-] of people is diffierent [fm1,-] , some like chanlleage [fm1,-] and they want to [wd4,-2] the work they never to [vp4,2-1] do.
To our young people, we should to [vp9,1-1] learn more and not just to be locked in the work we are.
Some people have been in the same job for their life.
Why?
There are all kinds of reasons.
For example, some are good at the job, they wouldn't change it.
Some think they always work [wd4,-3] the same surrounding, relationships and companions are familar [fm1,-] to them.
It is easy to deal with problems in work or life.Furthermore, the others want to change the job, owning to the need of work etc., they have to continue his job.
Some people would like to change their jobs constantly.
Maybe they like the challeging [fm1,-] change.
In the addition, maybe they didn't like the old job.
Maybe they long for high salary and equal opportunity.
They think new jobs are fit for them.
I think there are advantages and disavantays [fm1,-] in two ways.
If you feel present job [np6,1-] isn't satisfied [wd3,1-] or you want to learn different field [wd4,-1] knowledge, you should change it as soon as possible.
On the contrary, if you like present job, you are satisfied with it.
You shouldn't change it like others.
At last, I hope everyone find [vp3,1-] a job that you like as soon as possible.
You will become a proficient employee.
As usual, in order to make a life, it is necessary for one to have a job.
But, someone likes working for one job throughout his life.
On the other hand, someone likes changing his job constantly.
What are the reason [np3,2-] for this?
The people who always does [vp3,3-] the same job usually thinks [vp3,s-] : In [fm3,-] his life, his income is stable, which means that he has a steady life, what he must do is concentrate his mind on his job, maybe, will be fruitful of his work.
The people who are not willing to do the same job change their jobs after a period of time.
These [pr1,s-] usually think, through changing [vp1,-1] to job [np6,1-] , more various experience could be got by him.
At the same time, he is looking for the job catering to him.
I think this is usually done by young people.
I am a student going to graduate.
It is also a problem facing [vp1,-1] to me that what kind of job I should choose.
In my opinion, changing jobs is very benefitful [fm2,-] for young person [np6,1-] , especially for the person like me, because this will make a person get more.
Unchanging jobs is suitable for the persons who are at the age of 40s or older, for they should have steady lives for their later lives.
People hold many views on job-hopping.
Some like to do [vp1,-1] with the same job for good.
By [pp1,-2] practise longly [fm1,-] , they can master it and do it very well.
The other factor is that one find [vp3,1-] a very good job or he likes it very much.
Others favorit [fm1,-] change the job oftenly [fm2,-] .
These people hope his life lively and their jobs challengable [fm1,-] .
I'm the second class.
But I think if someone changes his job more oftenly [fm2,-] , he couldn't do them [pr3,s-] well.
It just like the monkey pick the corn.
So I'm for [pp1,-2] stick with [vp2,1-2] a job which suit [vp3,3-] you [pr1,s-] very much and do it precisely.
"Do it well or give it up!
" it's my view on job-hopping.
I'll find out my favorit [fm1,-] job and devote my life to it.
After graduated, everyone is faced on such problem as hunting a job.
Then, what's your view on Job-Hopping?
Some people like to engaging [vp5,1-] in a job consistently.
They think if you do a job for a long time, little by little, you can be good at it.
Then, it is more possible for you to do some achievements.
Especially, if you have studies [vp9,1-2] some certain subjects, you must want to do a relative job to testify how do you study.
While [cj1,-s] , other people prefer to change [vp1,2-2] their jobs frequently.
Because they think if they do many kinds of jobs, they can obtain many kinds of knowledge and experience from it.
I agree with [wd3,1-3] the first opinion, ie.
doing a job forever.
Because I want to succeed in one field.
The job is very important to all of the people.
Someone like [vp3,1-] [vp1,1-3] do a job from [pp1,-2] begin to end.
Because they like this job and prefer to contribute their lives to the job.
Another reason is that they like stability and they think changing job [np6,1-] is too tired.
They don't want [vp1,-1] make [wd3,-s] themselves into troubles.
But the other one like [vp3,1-] change [vp1,3-1] job [np6,1-] constantly.
Because they think what do all kinds of jobs is a challenge to themselves.
They like [vp1,-1] see how much are their abilitys [fm1,-] .
They want [vp1,-1] trying in various regions.
I think it is important to find a position suitable to me.
When we change jobs, we must think if it is suitable to me [pr3,s-] .
As soon as we find a job that we like and we are interesting [aj4,-1] in this scales, we should do it continuely [fm2,-] until we contribute [wd3,1-1] ourselves.
Job-Hopping is a thought of one's future work.
What type of job should I take?
People have different views.
Some one likes to do only one job for his whole life.
He can devote his whole life to the job, so he may make great achievement in his field.
Others also think that taking a stable job means he needn't worry about losing job [np6,1-] in a respective [wd3,1-] long time.
In a word, they focouse [fm1,-] on the stability.
However, someone like [vp3,1-] to take a job for his life, because is afraid of adopting [wd3,1-] to the new working places.
Also, he hasn't the ability to receive new technoledges [fm1,-] .
On the other hand, some people like to change his job for a short time.
The reason may be that: the present work doesn't suit [vp1,-1] to him, and he thinks the job cann't [fm1,-] prove his abilitys [fm1,-] .
Secondly, he likes to challenge.
In my opinion, when and how to change one's job should be decided by the present things.
We should adjust our directions according to the requirements of the society.
If the job is very suitale [fm1,-] to me, why should I change the job?
Similarly, if the job does not prove my ability, why should not I look for another job?
Job-Hopping is an interesting thing.
What do you think?
Some people work on [wd3,1-2] one job all their life, because they think there are many benifits [fm1,-] in this.
For example, in Japan, if you work more time than others, you will have more chance to get high rank, and good salary.
in [fm3,-] China, people who do not want to move their jobs [cc3,2-] .
all [fm3,-] always think the relatinship [fm1,-] with others, the house, the chirld [fm1,-] , so they are stable.
But some other people urually [fm1,-] work from one job to another.
Why is it?
Because those people have the different thought.
They want to study more and have more friends, or they want to find the well [wd3,1-1] place that they can work, or even they want to travl [fm1,-] from one city to another, one country to another by this way.
If you ask what's my option, I can tell you that I will change my job sometimes before 30.
Because I want [vp1,-1] learn more about this world.
After this, I will do a job that I love for a long time.
I think I can do well by [wd3,-2] this way.
It is my view on Job-Hopping.
What do you think about it?
Today, many people would like to do the same job all at last [wd3,1-] .
They think that a steady job will bring him [pr3,s-] a steady life.
So they can do their things that they like to do in their spare time.
But another [wd3, -1] people don't like steady job [np6,2-] .
They always like to change their jobs.
Because they think they will find the value and the interest of the life through changing the job.
Most of them want to chang [fm1,-] their life through changing the job.
My view on job-hopping is to find a job adapted [wd3,1-2] to myself by changing job [np6,1-] consicently [fm1,-] and then insist [vp1,-1] it on [pp2,-2] my life, in order to realize my order [wd3,1-3] in my life.
There is such a words [np3,1-] , "Happiness consist [vp3,1-] in work," so people all over the world like to work.
The attitude on [wd3,1-] the job, among them, can be divided into two groups.
One is the persons who take up a job for all his or her [pr3,s-] life, the other is the people who enjoy [vp1,-1] change jobs from time to time, from one place to another....
According to a questionaire [fm1,-] , the former group is one who is traditional.
Because we live in society, a steable [fm1,-] work may make our life comfortable.
You would not consider much of [wd5,1-] futher [fm1,-] .
You only to be on punctual to wok and do work good, better and best.
So [wd5,-s] everyday you are in good mood to go [vp1,-1] work.
The second class may be called up up-to-date persons [cc4,1-] .
They like to meet challege [fm1,-] rather than like [vp1,-1] for one job for ever.
They think the value of man consist [vp3,3-] in overwhelming all the difficities [fm1,-] [cc3,3-] and all the challege [fm1,-] .
They think there are so many opportunies [fm1,-] in their life.
In other words, their work full of venture [wd3,1-] , full of challege [fm1,-] , full of interesting.
In my opiny [fm1,-] , I should choose the one.
For a girl, I hope I succedd [fm1,-] .
I always think person wherever he be, the most important is to realize his or her value.
Some people like [vp1,-1] work at [wd3,1-] a sort of work in their work-life [fm2,-] .
Because they think people shouldn't change his work or he [pr3,s-] will work unsuccessfully.
The reason is people wouldn't atention [fm1,-] on the work.
But, some people often like [vp1,-s] change their work at [wd5,-1] sometimes and in [wd5,-1] somewhere.
Because they think that is interesting and can study much knowledge.
The second view is my view on Job-Hopping.
I had work at saleing [fm1,-] shopping [wd3,1-] and teaching a pupil English and mathimatic [fm1,-] .
Through my activities, I study many means of answering some questions.
I know some people and make their [wd3,1-] into my friend.
My ability is made much progresses.
Now, I can live alone and needn't my parents' help.
So, you have listened [vp6,-s] to me, if you were I [pr4,s-] , you wouldn't like [vp1,-1] change your work frequently.
?
Under the situation of reforming and opening, we are facing an important problem--job.
There appear [vp1,-s] some different points on job-hopping.
Some would like to go in for only one job in their lives, perhaps because they love their jobs very much.
They devote themselves to their jobs.
They want to research further so that they get more achievements.
Others would like to change their jobs, perhaps because they like much challege [fm1,-] which shows their abilities.
 [cc3,2-] I like challege [fm1,-] .
I think two jobs are fit [vp1,1-2] with me.
But I don't mean I go in for they [pr4,s-] at the same time.
I would like go in for [wd3,2-] a job for some years, then find another job which is a challege [fm1,-] for me.
I think it not only train my ability [cc3,-] to adapt [vp1,-s] to the society but also proves my experence [fm1,-] ability.
I like it [pr1,s-] .It is an opinion of one.
Everyone has his(her) own job when he(she)grows up.
Job [np6,1-] is important to us.
There are many people who like to do only one job in his whole life.
They think, when one do [vp3,1-] a job for a few years, he(she) would be skilled with the job, and in the following years, he(she)can do the job easily and does [vp3,s-] the job better easily [wd6,s-] .
Another kind of people likes [vp3,4-] to change job [np6,1-] now and then, when they do a job for some times [wd3,1-] , they have no interest in the job, and then they change their jobs.
Sometime [wd2,-] , people change their jobs only because they want to find a job with more pay.
My view on job-hopping is that one should better do one job only in one's life.
As I said above, when one do [vp3,1-] a job for some time, he(she) would be similar [wd3,1-] with the job.
Then he(she) can find ways to improve the job.
On the contrary, if one often change [vp3,2-] his job, it is difficult for him to apply to the job at the beginning.
So he can meet many difficulties in his job.
And then he will not do the job easily.
I wish that you would do your own job well in your life.
In life, some people like taking up the same job only.
In their opinion, as a man who has enterprised [aj4,-1] heart, he should continue his course to the end no matter how tough it is.
They believe that where there is a will there is a way and that success belongs to those who can stick to his cause with perseverance spirit [wd5,1-] .
While, the others are fond of changing jobs constantly.
Because they like fresh sense [wd3,1-] and dislike to the same thing unceasingly.
They think that repeating one work is a dull thing, which will make them lose enegy [fm1,-] and desire to [wd3,1-] working, and it is important to have enegy [fm1,-] and desire of work.
Personally, I don't think that we should encourage people to change jobs or discourage them from doing so.
It is up to individual decide [wd2,s-] .
The most important thing for us is to take up the work we favoriat [fm1,-] and attain the aim that realize our personal social value and serve our country.
Every one must have something to do.
But how long does he do the job is a problem.
Some people like [vp1,-1] take a job for ever.
Usually, there are three reasons.
First, some of them like their jobs very much.
They feel that everything they do is very interesting, second, some of them think: their jobs are good enough and can earn good money, so they needn't [vp9,-1] to change them.
Third, some of them take their jobs they are good at, while other jobs are not familar [fm1,-] to them.
While some people like to change their jobs often.
There are two reasons in common.
One is their jobs aren't fit for him.
The other is they the jobs are rountine [fm1,-] and they want some interesting and challengeble [fm1,-] jobs to do.
For job [np6,1-] , I think, we should first make a goal and we decide to do for [wd5,1-] it.
Then we get a job to realize our goals.
So we shouldn't change our work often, except they are really not fit for realizing our goals.
Therefore I want everyone like the job really, and do good for it [pr1,s-] .
There are different views on Job-Hoping.
Someone would like to take up the same job for a long time, even in his life.
It is due for [wd3,1-] they think that they can improve skill, accumulate experience, then lead to higher efficiency.
But some people don't think that, they would change job [np6,1-] usually [wd3,1-] rather than stay in the same position or the same company.
Their causes are who engages in one job too long will tiresome, No [fm3,-] curiousity [fm1,-] , No [fm3,-] freshment [fm2,-] , then people feel [wd5,-s] will lose passion gradually.
Moreover, staying in the same position will lead to lower efficiency.
My view on job-hoping is that people should stay in the same company, which will enhance [vp1,-5] one skillful, acquaint with equipment technology and apparatus, so can bring sophisticated manipulating.
Usually changing job [np6,1-] might not find the best position, but may make one no gain finally.
We often talk about our job-hopping together.
Some person liked to work [vp1,-s] about the same jobs.
They often said they did not like to change their jobs.
They could work in the same skills [wd3,1-] .
Another persons [np3,1-] liked to change their jobs.
They thought they could find a better job from changing it [pr1,s-] .
They liked to learn more skills in different job [np6,1-] .
I think it is important to us that we learn a job skill [cc1,1-] .
So when you work just first, you can't change it.
You can find wether [fm1,-] you like your work or not through a long time.
If you are sure that it is not fit for you, you may change [wd3,-3] a new job.
It is the most important thing you find your value in your work.
But not change your job.
Nowadays, with the social reform and more oppotunity [fm1,-] , more and more people have been changing their jobs frequently.
The reason of job-hopping may be various [aj5,s-] from poorly-paid [wd7,-] , bad wording condition to less challenging.
And this phenomenon in particular to newly graduated college students for they are so ambitious and not easily satisfied.
They keep on jumping for every chance.
As everything has two sides, There [fm3,-] are also a large number of people, esp.
aged people, who prefer [vp1,-s] their present job rather than get a new one.
They enjoy the long-established relations around and dislike a totally strange enviorment [fm1,-] .
My opinion is that; as long as the job is not suitable for you, I mean you can't use your talent and ability to the full measure [wd3,1-] or there isn't any hope for you to be promoted, surely you have the right to change you [wd3,-1] job.
But there is also a precondition ie [fm1,-] , whenever, you should work hard and try your best and then you have the right to say that the work isn't fit for you or is not worthwhile.
Otherwise, you don't deserv [fm1,-] any opportunity.
Some people always work on a job.
They think if a person works in a company all the time he will look on the company as his home.
And he will work hard for the company.
Then the company will be developing.
If someone finds [vp1,-s] the company worse in business, he will want to leave and look for another it.
In fact, this case is disadvantage to be, because he isn't patient to work it.
Otherwise, there are some people who like to often change jobs.
They think they will not live a good life is his company is in bad condition.
These persons mainly consider his [pr3,s-] own income.
They say that the head of the company doesn't take care of them and these will lead the company to be over [wd7,s-] .
My idea is that if the company is advantage to develop us, we should not only look upon [wd3,1-] the money but we should work hard for it [pr1,s-] .
Every adults [np3,1-] is working every day.
One hand , some of them like doing one job without changing.
Because they are used to that job, and they can finish the same work smoothly within the limited time.
Which makes them work more efficiently.
On the other hand, some people prefer [vp1,-s] change their job constantly.
The reason is that they can maintain full energy in different envirements [fm1,-] .
They believe new jobs are more attractive for them.
What's more, new jobs are of a chanllege [fm1,-] to them.
In my opinion, these two thought are very commen [fm1,-] and understandable.
Everybody should choose one on principle his own feeling.
If you are a stable man.
You may be like the first one [pr1,s-] .
Because a stable job makes you satisfied and feel safe.
Therefore, you have a good feeling to put into your job every day and result in a good achievment [fm1,-] .
However, if you are an active man, you may more like the latter in that new jobs give you a chance to challenge.
You will realize your amibitious [fm1,-] during continous [fm1,-] changing.
I guees [fm1,-] that these thought may be more adaptable [wd3,-] to young person.
Finally, I concluded that a person should often change his job when he was young and in his old age, he would be stable.
In the highly competitive market economy, most of us faces [vp3,3-] [vp1,-1] with the difficulty of getting a job.
Our government is no longer responsible for arranging it.
Finding a job is not only a challengement [fm2,-] but also a chance to testing [vp9,1-] our abilities.
Considerable number of us intend to perform one job in their lives.
They think that it is not easy to grasping [vp9,1-] skills.
Stable job can make them be [wd5,s-] more familiar with enviornment [fm1,-] so that they may do it very well, many of us agree with [wd3,1-] this idea.
The traditional thoughts greatly influene [fm1,-] us now.
On the other hand, others don't think so.
They prefer variable work to the same one.
The new things are challenging to them.
When they find that a job isn't fit for them, they hope to get a new one.
Thus, they can show their abilities brilliantly.
In my opinion to this [wd5,1-] , As [fm3,-] with every problem, there are two sides about this.
Engaging in doing one job in one's life is as not [wd1,1-] favorable as changing jobs frequently.
One must think carefully when she or he want [vp3,1-] to get a new job.
Gaining a job is much more important to everyone of us.
Diffirent [fm1,-] people has [vp3,1-] diffirent [fm1,-] job-hopping acording [fm1,-] to their diffirent [fm1,-] chericters [fm1,-] .
Some people prefers [vp3,2-] a job in [wd3,-4] which he would devote all his life in [wd5,s-] just because his loved the job.
This kind of person have [vp3,1-] a comon [fm1,-] cherictoristics [fm1,-] that they are thorough [aj5,s-] in doing their jobs and they don't like the changed positions in their lives.
They want a stable job and a stable income.
So they choose a single job in their lives.
On the other hand, some people like to change their jobs often.
This kind of person perfer [fm1,-] chanlenge [fm1,-] life.
They want to earn a lot of money to improve their life conditions.
They always looking for a job which has better conditions and the higher selories [fm1,-] .
In my opinon [fm1,-] , I want a job which suits me best.
Because jobs are not only the methord [fm1,-] depending on which you will survive but also a way you will put you ideal into realistics [fm2,-] .
So you must love this job when you do it and you can do something which is really benefical [fm1,-] to our soceirty [fm1,-] .
No metter [fm1,-] whether you will change your job, loving your job is more important.
If you love it, you will proberly [fm1,-] step on the road which leads to your success.
Some people like to do one job all their lifes [fm2,-] .
I think it maybe right.
First of all they feel like going at their jobs and they feel very excited when they are working.
Second I think some of these people are not willing to change their jobs though they proberbly [fm1,-] dislike their jobs.
Some people often like to change their jobs.
Especially some young people they want to have a wide sky to fly freely like a bird.
Because these people have much ambition and thy want to show [wd3,-1] themselves and want to achieve somethings [fm2,-] .
But my opinion is different from them.
On one hand, I should study hard, harder and hardest.
Before I get a job I must make [vp1,-s] me to be a useful and skilled men.
Once I choose a job I will love it and do it well.
On the other hand, if the job isn't excited [aj4,-1] to me I will consider [vp1,-1] to change one.
But in these days it is very difficult to find a good job for oneself.
So I think whatever we do, above all, we should try to make us love the job.
Thus, we cannot often change our job and when we become older and older we can do a lot and do successful [wd2,s-] .
These are my view [np3,1-] on Job-Hopping.
If we want to live, we would have to work.
So there are many different views on Job-Hopping in people.Some people like to take only one job in his all [wd1,1-] life for they would not like to move from one place to another and they could have a stable income.
Some people would like to change job [np6,1-] from time to time, for they like to recept [fm1,-] challenge and make their life instresting [fm1,-] .
My view on job-hopping is different with [aj2,1-] the people that have mentioned [vp7,2-] .
I like to change job [np6,1-] several years when I start to work, but not oftenly [fm2,-] .
In this period, I like the challenge.
From the challenge I could inhance [fm1,-] my capacity and experience.
When over forty, I would choose one job that I like best to take and take it until I retire, so that I could have a stable life in the left [wd1,-1] time.
This is my view on Job-Hopping.
I would be very glad if you have the same view with me and I hope everyone have [vp3,1-] their own view on Job-Hopping and each of them has a good life.
Allmost [fm1,-] everyone has a job.
But each has his own Job-Hopping.
Some like doing a job in his [pr3,6-] holelife [fm1,-] , some like [vp1,-1] change his [pr3,3-] job as he [pr3,s-] like [vp3,1-] .
Those who like doing a job in his holelife [fm1,-] because he [pr3,s-] like the job.
They know exectly [fm1,-] what they are and their own fellings [fm1,-] .
They do not want to be in the world unknow [fm1,-] .
They doing their own business as hard as they were.
There still some do not like challenging themselves.
They want a fine house and a warm family to live in.
And some like [vp1,-1] change their jobs have some kind of view.
They maybe [wd3,1-] do not like the job they are doing.
They maybe [wd3,-1] want to challenge themselves.
They maybe [wd3,-1] want to be high [wd2,-] payed [fm2,-] .
They maybe [wd3,-1] want to live in different place [np6,3-] .
There are some reasons even they do not know.
Maybe they are the felling [fm1,-] .
They trust their felling [fm1,-] , Maybe there are something unknow [fm1,-] .
In my own view, if I have the job I like, I would do it for a life time.
But if I do not get the job I like, I maybe [wd3,-1] change the job.
There still be a way.
If the job I do is not the job I like I still be remine [fm1,-] if they do need me.
You do it for a living, not for playing.
There are some responsbilities [fm1,-] you can not foget [fm1,-] .
When we are adults, we will look for jobs.
People have different views on the jobs.
Some people like doing a kind of job all time.
To them, begin to do the work first, they are unskilled.
But they will be effiently [fm1,-] with time [wd4,1-1] on.
They are used to doing some kind of work and are disvadtage [fm1,-] than the other.
Once work is changed, they are often that they can not adjust themslve [fm1,-] .
Other [wd3,-s] like to change work.
To them, it is a [np7,-1] enjoy [wd2,-] when do some different jobs.
They are tiresome [wd3,1-2] of working a single job long time.
In my view, one should not often change his job.
If he does it, he will not get skilled about the job and get little.
It is not good to the future.
But if one does a single job in his life, he can not study more, and enlarge his skills [cc3,2-] .
I think that one should do the job that he like [vp3,1-] , if his condition change [vp3,1-] , he may find other work.
But I don't agree that one must do some single job in all his life.
Some people like to do only one job in their life-long time.
Since they recived [fm1,-] one job.
He looks [vp1,-1] the job his second life and devote all [wd5,-1] himself into [wd3,1-] the work.
He works very hard, foucucing [fm1,-] all his attentions on the factor [wd3,1-] , throwing his sweat [cc3,-] on the field and seldom.
This kind of people cann't [fm1,-] do better in their life.
Another kinds [np3,1-] of people like to change their work frequently.
They get the job in this company for one year and worked in another factory for several months.
Their life-long period, they can't know what's achieviment [fm1,-] but they may get full experience in their life.
On [pp2,-2] my opinion, I do these two kind of people and not do them too.
In my former [wd3,1-1] life I change my work to get experience and in my later life-time.
I do in one word [wd3,1-] to get achievenment [fm1,-] .
Today, with the development of society, all kinds of jobs are constantly occured [vp1,s-] [fm1,-] .
So everyone has some chances to choose itself [wd5,-1] job.
Many people like to work on a job from the beginning to the end.
Because they like the job more than else others [wd5,1-] ; they want to devote themselves the working; they want to gain some great sucess [fm1,-] in this aspect.
They type of people has a [np7,-1] only belief.
Many people like to change their jobs constantly.
They believe that they is [vp3,1-] looking for [vp1,1-2] themselves valueness [fm2,-] from all kinds of jobs and attempts.
The type of people can soon adopt [wd3,-s] to all kinds of different envirmental [fm1,-] .
They believed that they have some ability to adopt [wd3,-2] to the society.
So they attempt to work on all kinds of jobs to check [wd3,-1] themselves.
But I believe that every one should have itself [wd5,-1] belief.
As we step into the society, maybe we can't recive [fm1,-] a [np7,-1] agreeable job, but we shouldn't give up, we finally find a [np7,-1] agreeable job to fit [vp1,-2] for itself.
But as we find the job, we should insist on [wd3,1-] it, we should devote ourselves to it and gain some success by our working.
In society, we should have ourselves work to step into it.
My view on job Hopping [fm3,4-2] is that has a fittness [fm1,-] job.
I want to look for a good job, then I will devote myself into [wd3,2-] it.
Some people like to do the same work all life, because they consider that they can do the work skilled [wd2,s-] by long time training.
And they needn't adapt [vp1,-4] to another new job.
So they have enough time to do other thing [np6,1-] they like.
Other people are fond of changing different jobs because they want to test their ability.
They want to release their potential by doing different jobs.
When they think the job is not challenging enough to themselves they find another new job.
I think that the career one person work [vp3,1-] on [wd3,1-] is defined by his characteristic [wd3,s-] .
Some people like calm and simple life so they love to do a job all time.
Other people like adventurous and challenging life.
They want to do some challenging things so they must change work to satisfy themselves.
I like the latter, because I dream of adventurous and challenging life.
Once you like your work, you will all through [wd5,1-] keep up with doing it.
In practice, there are many people who would like to be engaged in a type of work.
Because I think [vp1,-s] it important to do their best to do well in what they should do.
It is not necessary for them to change their work.
Somebody like [vp3,1-] their work, even they conviece [fm1,-] it as the best important thing in their life.
No one can change their ideas.
Even though, there are many people who would like to often [wd1,-3] change their work.
Because they must change their work when it is not fit for them.
Sometimes they think that they can't show their capacities in their work.
In order to abtain [fm1,-] many more chances, they will select another work with no hestate [fm1,-] .
My view on Job-Hopping is that only you think you need a new condition, you are going to creat [fm1,-] it, if you think [vp1,-s] it not necessary, you'd better stay in the place where you stayed at first.
I think that chance is all in our heads if we make good use of our chance, we will "go" further [fm1,-] .
Once we losing it, it won't come again.
Some people like to engage [vp1,-s] a kind of job all their lives, because they considered that the same job could permit them to do the job with enough times [wd3,1-] , for example a man might started his cooking carrier when he was young.
As a result he may develop his cooking skills after [wd7,-1] years, also he got guys from his job.
Second a man prefered [fm1,-] to do a job because to which is the most one he (or she ) wanted to devoted themselves; a teacher may had [vp9,1-] the instuctor [fm1,-] as the objective of his life, a policeman regard [vp3,1-] defeating crime as his own duty... all the above are just the second case.
While some people like to change their jobs constantly because they find every new job offered them a completely different field.
In the new world they may return to the starting line.
They think it is full of challenge to do the new work well [wd5,s-] , also a larish [fm1,-] experience of one's career offers plenty of knowledge for him.
My view on job-hopping is that the job we engaging [vp4,s-] must fit [vp1,-s] in our interest at first.
That is to say we can obtain pleasures from our jobs.
On the other hand the job should develop our merits as well.
Everyone in the world should have his view on Job-Hopping.
Somebody would like to do the same work all ways [wd7,s-] , because he hopes that he will be a specific expert in one field.
There are many people who have achievements.
According to them, if you focus on your work, you will achive [fm1,-] greatment [fm2,-] .
There are other people who like to change their work frequently.
Some of them believe that they will find a good job to fit them.
The other of them [wd5,1-] believe that new job [np6,1-] can enchance [fm1,-] them.
My view on Job-Hopping is to work hard in one field.
Because I believe that only if have [wd1,-1] I enough acknolagy [fm1,-] , I could access [wd3,1-] in my field.
Therefor [fm1,-] , I will work hard in one field all ways [wd7,s-] , then I can get enough acknology [fm1,-] about my field.
Today, my country is rebuting [fm1,-] , and requires specific expert [np6,3-] , so I have chance to do those [pr1,s-] .
To Job-Hopping, there are defferent [fm1,-] views one from one, I think.
Generally-- speaking, two views can often occur.
Some prefer to do a job in all his life.
There are two reasons, I think.
Firstly, he is satisfied with the current job, for its high wages, good conditions as well [wd5,1-] , moreover, it is challenging to him.
Secondly, he is afraid that the next one is worse, after all it needs enough courage and ability.
Some prefer to change jobs often.
The reasons, by contrast, are that the job isn't suitable for him, or he want [vp3,1-] to prove his ability, dispite [fm1,-] the good conditions of the current job.
My view is that if he have [vp3,1-] enough ability and courage, he can change his [wd4,-] certainly [wd3,1-] , but he must think it over in advance, because it is an important thing to him or his family.
In the world there are some people and some kinds of jobs.
In order to life [wd2,3-] , any adult needs to have a job.
There are two views about how to work: The first, some one likes to do only a [wd3,1-1] job all his life.
Because he likes [vp1,-1] live a stability [wd2,-1] life; Because he is highly responsible.
He thinks that one should always like his job and work for it for his life.
The second, some one likes to work [wd3,1-3] from one job to another frequently.
He also has his reason for [wd5,-2] to do so.
This kind of man is lively.
He like [vp3,1-] to live an uncalm [fm2,-] life.
He thinks that doing this kind of job is adventure [wd2,1-] and stimulatous [fm2,-] .
Compared with that [np8,-4] two kinds of men, I'd like to do as the first man, I think that a man should have a spirit of loving his job.
Furthermore, it is a waste of time for one from a familiar job, to another unfamiliar job.
There is not a good job or bad.
So we should do a job and contribute all our lives for [wd3,s-] it.
People live in the world must be work for themselves and for society.
They may choose adequate jobs freely and they may have different views about job.
There are some people who do one job throughout the working-time.
Because they think it can make them skillful.
Do [vp4,-s] one job gives them more chances to train themselves in technology and skill.
They will be familiar with the work process.
While there are other views about job-hopping.
Some people like to work in different regions, they think that different jobs can provides different skills and can challenge in different aspects.
Also some people work too long time about one job which will be tired of.
They need change job frequently.
My view on job-hopping is to work on one job, also to be familiar with other skills with which we should familiar for our work and life.
Do [vp4,-s] one job can train us specialist [np3,1-] in this field.
Some people like to have one kinds [np3,1-] of jobs in his [pr3,s-] life.
Even they change working place to do the same job.
They may feverite [fm1,-] the job or they have special kill on this job or they can do nothing if they leave the work.
On the other hand, there are many people who often change their work.
Sometimes they may word as a teacher but when you letter [fm1,-] meet him he maybe [wd5,-1] is a manger [fm1,-] in a company.
They always think the job they used to do is not suit [wd3,s-] for him, or can not express his capacity [cc3,2-] .
So they give up it [wd1,1-] and find a new one.
I agree with the latter.
Because once we find a job it may not [wd4,-2] the best for us.
Only through the change of job may we find the most propriate [fm1,-] job.
Some people like to do the same kind of job from beginning to the [wd5,-1] end.
There are some reasons for this, first, those people who can do a particular job very well always [wd5,2-] feel happy when they do it, second, some people like the lifestyle of some what coincise [fm1,-] , they do not like to make themselves too busy, and do not want to face frustration other jobs bring to them.
Others like to do different jobs, these people are always active, full of energy, and they think do different kinds of jobs can make their life always full of freshness, and so that they enjoy different happyness [fm1,-] .
In my opinion, people should do different kind [np3,1-] of jobs.
Life for us is only once [aj5,s-] , we shouldn't live through it indifferently.
If you do only one job, how do you know what all of [wd5,1-] you can do?
For a serious person, do the more important job he can do for both himself and the society is his duty.
If you find out that you can only do well what you do now, you can just focus more attention or energy on it later.
Yet this kind of condition is very few [wd3,1-] .
Different people have different view [np3,1-] on Job-Hopping.
Some people would rather devote himself [pr3,s-] to one job.
They think the time for one to work is short.
If you do many jobs in the limit [wd3,-1] time, you don't do only one job well enough and you are difficult to make progress.
But other people like to change their jobs many times in their life.
When one has been doing a job for a long time, we [pr3,s-] will [wd4,1-1] tired of it and has [vp3,s-] a low spirit.
If he have [vp3,1-] a new job, his spirit get [vp3,1-] high, and can do the job well easily.
I consider that, one should devote himself into [wd3,2-] one job, and do it well, in order to get the top of the field quickly and make large progresses [cc4,1-] .
But you also must [wd1,1-] know something of other job [np6,1-] .
If your job is lost one day, you could enter other job [cc3,2-] easily.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to take one job for his life.
Such people are almost pushy job- takers [fm2,-] and they like their job very much.
They are eager to make progress in their jobs.
They sometimes dedicate their most [wd5,s-] time to developing their job.
In a short, such people like the job more important than the salary.
However, some people like to chang [fm1,-] their job frequently.
Such people are almost look [vp9,4-] [vp1,-s] the job less important than the salary.
My view on job hopping is the first kind.
I think work is an important part of our life.
We not only make money on [wd3,-1] it , but obtain much interest from job [np6,1-] .
We should take job [np6,1-] carefully.
<ST 4> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <AGE ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 1> <WAY 1> <SCH 2745> <TITLE My View on Job-Hopping> <SCORE 9> <ID 440722>Many people are always having the same job for many years even for all their life time, especially of the old man and woman, perhaps it's because they like the steady rythem [fm1,-] such as the regular working time, the working conditions or the steady salary.
In short, they want to live a peaceful life all the time.
On the countrary [fm1,-] some people always the young man chang [fm1,-] their jobs for [pp2,-3] time to time.
They don't like to do the same thing from day to day.
They enjoy challenging themselves by the different jobs or the irregular conditions or the different people from all the countries.
During the working days, they can make friends or get much useful information which they'll helpful in the future.
I like to change jobs every year.
The society is in [wd5,s-] developing fast and many chance [np3,1-] we can have, why don't go out the old job for a new challenging one?
It's the chances that the young man need first.
I think that "grasp the chance is grasping the future.
"
There are different views on Job-Hopping.
Some people like to take only one kind of job for ever.
But others pefer [fm1,-] to change work some times [wd3,1-] , they all their reason to support their view.
The first kind of man, they want a stable job.
They think they take a same job for long time, they will be familar [fm1,-] with their job.
They will be skilled in operating medicines.
They have much more experiences in their job.
In a word, they think [vp1,-s] it better to have a kind of stable job.
To the second kind of man, often changing job is alert [wd3,s-] .
Because they have many chances to show their ability [cc3,2-] .
They also think that it is chaningable [fm1,-] to take all kinds of job.
Then their life is full of interest.
They are going to adventure [wd2,s-] .
They always want to change their job from time to time.
Everthing [fm1,-] has two sides.
My view on job-hopping is that we should often change our job.
Because our society needs sythenic [fm2,-] ability man [wd3,2-] , we should study hard in order to adapt [vp1,-s] to the development of economition [fm1,-] .
With the development of our society.
People's ideas of job are changing day by day.
In general, people can be seprated [fm1,-] into two groups.
One group like [vp3,1-] to do one job forever.
Because they think [vp1,-1] it possible for them to become experts in the field they are working in, and they can make good freids [fm1,-] with others.
But another group want [vp3,1-] to change their jobs frenquently [fm1,-] .
Because they are eager to know the unknown world and they want to learn more skills and they can get new ideas.
To [pp2,-2] my view, I like the first group.
China has a says [wd3,1-] " When doing a job, then love it".
Because people have limited energy, you [pr1,s-] should focus on one thing then you may succeed.
If you do many jobs in [wd4,1-2] short time, you will never succeed.
We know the number of types of job [np3,2-] is very large.
different [fm3,-] man does different job.
People's views on job-Hopping is [vp3,4-] not [wd4,1-1] same.
Some people enjoy doing a job in their lives.
Certainly, now many men are like them.
They think they do a job for a relatively long time.
they [fm3,-] will do well in the jobs.
They acquaint [vp1,-s] them and have some skills.
If they turn to do other jobs, they have no experience in doing well [wd1,-1] them, they don't understand them, they will not feel favourable [wd3,s-] .
But some people like to turn to do other jobs, they enjoy challenging themselves, they will gain different joy from a new job, they possiblely [fm1,-] work better in the new position.
Electing a favourable job is a difficult thing.
So I think I will not turn to other job [np3,1-] when I find a good one, but, if the job is not suitable to me.
I will not continue working.
To find a new one is necessary.
Many people like to going [vp5,1-] in for a job because they like stationary life and do not want to change the environment they were [vp6,-s] living.
Also they interest [vp1,-s] in this job.
Many people often transfer their job from this to another.
One reason is probably they have not found a job interesting,this can not hold him back.
Another reason is maybe [wd5,s-] they aren't satisfactory [wd3,1-1] of their salaries, their working conditions or other factor [np3,6-] .
In my opinion, to find a proper job is above all.
Before hunting a job you should make certain [wd3,1-] your special field and your interest, they are both important.
From our childhood we began [vp1,-1] on studying.
After basic education we often need some special training or continue our study for a special subject.
You should see to [vp1,-s] your selection and then learning in your filed.
Your learning may be infuluenced [fm1,-] by your interest.
After this, you should consider many factors to [wd3,1-3] your job hunting, then decide to select one job for you.
But one job you selected is often not be [wd5,s-] the best for you, you should put your heart into it to make the job best.
Otherwise if you couldn't settle down yourself, then you need check yourself.
All the job you want don't [vp3,s-] [vp9,s-] always be the one you wanted.
The period [wd3,1-] is changing very fast you should insist on [wd3,1-] learning .
Learn [vp4,-s] from books, from the people surrounding you, this will benefit you, so I like to work in [wd3,-2] my interest and be stationary.
Everyone has his view on varies [fm1,-] job-hopping.
Somebody like [vp3,1-] taking one job all along.
These people love quiet, stable [wd4,2-] , and they don't want to go anywhere.
Other people often change their job, because they like chanllege [fm1,-] .
They want to overcome difficulty [np6,1-] and want to defeat [wd3,1-1] themselves.
I belong to the second sort as [wd3,s-] we [pr3,s-] mentioned in the last paragraph.
In [wd4,1-1] present society, anybody who is a man would not live without money.
I have many dreams, but I also have to take [wd3,1-2] the society.
I love work and I like chanllege [fm1,-] .
If one job can verify one's value [cc3,2-] , I would chose this job.
We would face very many diffculties [fm1,-] when we change our works [wd3,s-] .
But we can't give up, or you are failurer [fm2,-] .
We may adjust ourselves to adoput [fm1,-] the new enviroment [fm1,-] .
We woke [fm1,-] hard or we study hard, which is good to us.
Though society is complex, we live with oneself [wd3,3-] , for oneself, and we can defeat oneself, at last we think the society is so simple.
There are some people who like going in for a job from begaining [fm1,-] to end.
They think changing of jobs will let them not [wd1,2-] work efficiently.
During the young time [cc4,1-] , they learned a [wd5,-2] specialized knowledge.
When they went into society, this [pr1,s-] entitled them the ability to work.
But some people think that it is no [wd3,s-] interesting for them to work only in [wd3,-2] one job.
They more [wd1,-s] like changing work from time to time, only in this way, work can be interesting.
During the colledge [fm1,-] time, [cc1,1-] they learned a lot of knowledge, not focused in one side , and they didn't like the specialize knowledge they learned in college.
So they learned some other knowledge.
At the time of work, they have more free working for job.
In my oppion [fm1,-] , I will go in for a job through my life, but I will still go in for a lot of amateur job, this will make me live more comfortable [wd2,s-] and suceed [fm1,-] in working for the people.
Some people like only one job in his life.
because [fm3,-] we can do the job fast without any thinking.
We can save a lot of time.
If we do one job every day, we will be fit for it better.
above [fm3,-] all it is helpful for improving technolog [fm1,-] .But some people like [vp1,-1] change job [np6,1-] often .Because he want [vp3,1-] to find a better job(He like [vp3,1-] the job and the job is fitted [wd3,1-] for him.
) some people like [vp1,-1] change job [np6,1-] because he want [vp3,1-] to master many kinds of technolog [fm1,-] .
It is better for him if the circumstance is changed.
In general, more people like a fixed job.
I think we can grasp some knowledge in some kinds of jobs.
But when we have a job we should not change the job frequently.
Because we change job [np6,1-] often, people will think we can't do well [wd1,-1] everything.
We can't get well with on [vp2,3-] the people aroud [fm1,-] us.
But when we need [vp1,-1] change a job insure [wd3,s-] we should change it with a lot of thinking.
Everyone has its [pr1,2-] own view on everything, and also on job-hopping.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to do a [np7,-1] same job as possible as he could.
Because, to him, the familiar circumbrance [fm1,-] , the old friends and the pleasure of his family are the most important.
But there is another kind of person who like [vp1,-1] change jobs at times.
Why does he act so?
Perhaps, to him, a new job can much more proves his capability, he likes changes around him.
He likes new conditions, new faces and even new challengments [fm2,-] .
He wants to show his adaptability and prove his value in new conditions.
To me, as being an time older, I hate the changes around me, and like to do the same job day after day.
I like to do the same entertainments [fm2,-] with same old friends and go to a same bar to have a drink.
There are many people who always like doing a kind of work.
This work brings enough money for him to live on.
First of all, they are always interested in it and they can find pleasure in it.
They are absorbed in it and can't leave it.
Many people often change their work.
If they do a job all the time they will be tired of it.
They like new things and like taking adventure [cc3,1-] .
They will find varity [fm1,-] of pleasure from different jobs.
I don't like doing the same job.
I want [vp1,-1] find pleasure from many ways.
Different jobs will give me different pleasure.
In our society if one man want [vp3,2-] to live or live better, he must have a job to do.
Only throug [fm1,-] working he can [wd1,1-] get money to buy what he need [vp3,1-] .
Some people like to do the same job for life.
They think that there are many advantages for this.
First, doing the same job, special skill [np6,1-] needed is constant [wd3,s-] , they don't have to learn other skills.
Seconld, they do the same job so that they can learn the knowledge and skill further, and achieve the achievement.
But some people like to change their jobs, just because they think that doing variable [wd3,-1] jobs can exercise their ability and choosing good jobs also can enable them to get much money.
In my vives [fm1,-] , I support the former, every one energy is limited.
We want to contribut [fm1,-] to the society and we can do a job well, which is the best way.
In our large county [fm1,-] , if many people change their job, continally [fm1,-] the society problems will occure [fm1,-] .
Many hard jobs will not be done.
For our [wd3,1-2] college students, since we have choose [vp9,1-] the professionl [fm1,-] field, we had better engage in the specialize [wd2,-] and do it well as possible as we can in the future.
In short, I appreciate the people who divide [wd3,-2] his life to a job.
Every [np3,s-] people have a different working ways [np3,3-] .
Some are content to go in for a job for lifes [fm2,-] .
Because they expect to assure the stability of his position and salary, which is considered as a common sense.Some are inclined to shift job [np6,1-] continously [fm1,-] .
Because they always seek [vp1,-1] for a [np7,1-1] ideal condition, which can provide him more chances to exert their abilities.
On [pp1,-2] my view, a variety of working ways is not most important for every people [np3,1-] , the importance is if we can dedicate our knowledges [fm2,-] to the society and promote human being's progress [cc3,3-] .
As a result, I think that Job-Hopping is only a kind of form of sevicing [fm1,-] for society.
Some of the people would devote themselves to one unchungable [fm1,-] job, the reason perhaps is that the job is their own aim and they like and want to go in for it with their all lives.
But some of the people would change their work often only because they don't like the job or they don't get enough money from the work.
About this question, my view on job-hopping may be the following three points: The first one, you should get a job you like or be [wd3,s-] interested in, then you work for it with your soul and heart, for one person should do some things for society more or less.
In your job, you must practice and achieve [vp1,2-] .
The second reason, if you can't find a good job, or you don't like you present job, you should make yourself like it, whatever you do, you should do good to people and yourself.
The last one is if you are a very good person, you may change your work until you get a very prefect one for you, then you should decide that you do your work seriously.
In all, we may change our jobs, but above all, we should consider our devotion to society.
If we don't make much good [cc3,2-] , but change jobs, I think it is no good for yourself [wd3,1-] and any people.
Alter all, we do everything just for the development of the society.
Some people like only one kind of job all his life, because they think since he [pr3,-] find [vp3,1-] a favorate [fm1,-] job, he should not change it.
They don't like always changeing [fm2,-] works [wd3,1-] .
There are too many terribles [fm2,-] , they think.
Generally speaking, the characteristics of this kind is single and inter-type [fm2,-] .
They prefer to lead a quiet life.
On the other hand, there are [vp3,1-1] another group of people, who like various work.
They like changeing [fm1,-] jobs in order to try [vp1,-1] on various of jobs in the world.
Their interests are very wide.
And this kind of men is very lively and outer-type [fm2,-] .
Because I'm an outer-type [fm2,-] person, changing work sometimes to improve myself is my choice.
However, I'm against those people who change their work only to enjoy themselves not to do it well.
Since, we find a good job, we should do it well.
This is my view on this question.
Most people have jobs.
And their jobs are in all kinds.
Some people like doing a [np7,-1] same job all life, but [wd3,s-] some people like changing their jobs often.
The two kinds of people both have their [wd4,s-] ---The first kind like [vp3,1-] their jobs very much, and they want to do something in their field.
For example, a person who likes music is doing music work, he like [vp3,1-] the music too much to change his job, and he will do this job all life.
The second kind people haven't a job that they like, and they feel they can do noting in their jobs.
Or some people want to change the enviorment [fm1,-] and find a good job.
So they change their jobs obstantly [fm1,-] .
My view on job-hopping is: When you like your job, you should do it hard; but when you don't like your job, you can change a job that meet [wd3,-1] you.
But don't change it too often, or you will do nothing in your life.
With the development of society, people's attituds [fm1,-] to jobs are changing greatly.
Some people think they should take only one job in their lives.
The reasons for this are that they love their job very much or they might think they are familar [fm1,-] with the job and have enough experiences for the job.
Even if they are somewhat unsuitable to it, they convince [vp1,-s] that they will do it well soon.
In contrast, some people like to change their jobs, according to their interest, some of them are bored with their jobs.
By changing, they will gain interests, and work in a comfortable envirement [fm1,-] .
Some of them also change their jobs for income or relationship when their income is not enough to meet the requirement of their family, they have to find a new job when they don't get along well with their workmates [fm2,-] or leaders, they also need to get a new job.
In my opnion [fm1,-] , people may take part time jobs according to their interests.
By doing so, their life will be more happly [fm1,-] .
We know that some people always devote themselves to only one job for good, while others like job-hopping.
Those who like doing the only job that they devote [vp1,-1] to think that the job is an important part of their lives.
They are always conservational [fm2,-1] people.
They hate job-hopping because they think the job-hoppings can't do [cc3,-2] their works carefully and hardly [wd2,-] .
But the job-hoppings regard that job-hopping make their lives more vivid, and they get more experiences when they have done so many works [wd3,s-] .
The new generation always holds this opinion.
To [pp2,-2] my opinion, I prefer devoting myself to one job.
Because if I always hop the job, I can't succeed in any job I've done.
When I see a ?good?job, I want to hop.
Practically, I lose the chance to succeed.
But if I devote [vp1,-1] to one job, I can manage to make my life.
Some people want to do a fixed job.
Because if they always do a job, they can do it well and they mustn't learn something else, making efforts.
And they can get on well with each other.
And they won't think how to face the strangers and how to make friends with them.
Others want to change the job often.
They don't like to do a job for ever.
They change them [pr1,s-] in order to learn something new and learn new abilities [cc3,2-] .
And they want to make friends with the strangers.
And they want to challenge the future.
I think, we should change the job often, so we can learn something new and know the world well.
When having some abilities, we can devote ourselves to the world well.
Some ones [np6,-s] likes to do a [wd3,-3] kind of job all throng [wd3,s-] his [pr3,s-] life.
They think that the job is good and they are familiar [aj2,1-1] in it .They have the good ways.
The importainest [fm1,-] is they don't like change [np6,1-] .
Some ones [np6,1-2] likes to change their job usually.
They like challenge.
They will learn to adopt many different job [np3,2-] and get well along with many different people.
And they think that often change [vp4,s-] job [np6,1-] will let them study more, and also can improve theirs [wd3,-1] capities [fm1,-] .
My view on Job-Hopping [fm3,-] is that I will do the job that I am interest [vp5,1-1] in.
The interest is most importanest [fm1,-] [aj3,1-] .
It can let me do my best in the job.
I also like [vp1,2-2] change job [np6,1-] , it have [vp3,1-] challenge.
It can make my experiementes [fm1,-] become abound.
And the wages also are very important.
Maybe, I will do a kind of job or change main [wd3,-1] job, but I will do my best!
Some people want to go in for one work for good, because they fell [fm1,-] that man must do it [pr1,s-] and like it.
Meanwhile, when they familiar with one work, they can do it better.
Furthermore, they maybe [wd3,-s] decline [vp1,-s] to live a standing life [cc4,1-] and avoid the unfamilar [fm1,-] fields.
On the other hand, some people like often [wd1,-3] change their work.
Firstly, they can touch [vp1,-s] in all kinds of new things, and they can come along with [wd3,2-] lots of people.
Secondly, their charator [fm1,-] of activity decide [vp3,s-] [wd3,s-] they can't take in [wd3,1-] one work otherwise, they feel poor.
On [pp2,-2] my opinion, one person do [vp3,1-] one work good [wd2,s-] or often change [vp3,s-] it, he consider [vp3,1-] his need corrdingly [fm1,-] , we can't say two habits which is right or which is better.
When individual person [np6,1-] feel [vp3,1-] his life is right, they [pr3,s-] will have a good time.
Some people like going in for one job.
Because, it can insure stable living resource [cc4,1-] .
This is the most important reason.
One can improve owner [wd3,s-] technolgy [fm1,-] in the field of the job.
By studying the knowledge of the job, one's ability become [vp3,1-] more skilled.
 [cc2,s-] This efficiency will enhence [fm1,-] .
Other people like changing jobs.
Firstly once they find the job is not suitable for him [pr3,s-] , they will want to change the job.
Secondly, they think that changing job is a challege [fm1,-] for them.
This, they can exert their abilities.
Lastly changing jobs can learn much more experience and knowledge.
My view on job-hopping is on condition that the job is suitable for me.
I will go in for it for ever and fit [vp1,-2] for it.
We must study and live through the job, so the job is important to us.
But how can we should [vp9,2-] do.
Some one like [vp3,1-] to do one job for a [wd5,1-1] long.
Because they think that can make [vp1,-3] to gain achievements.
Some one like [vp3,1-] to change their jobs frequently.
Because this makes them find a job that fit [vp3,3-] [vp1,-1] for them at last.
I don't disagree with the first one.
But I like the latter better.
Because the job is [vp9,-1] fit for us or not is concerned to our success.
If we are at a work that we do not like, we will be not interested in it and can not do it good [wd2,s-] .
So when we find the job do [vp3,1-] not fit [vp1,-1] for us, we must try another one.
Some people may like to work on the same job for ever.
Maybe these people have no much know ledge and good skills.
So they are difficult to quit a kind of new job.
Some people may like to change his [pr3,s-] job.
Maybe they have good skills and much knowledge.
Or they are young.
Changing job may give them many chance [np3,1-] to study more knowledge [cc3,2-] and accumulate much [np8,-1] experiences.
So they can quit many kinds of jobs.
My write [wd3,1-2] on job-hopping is that whether changing job [np6,1-] is not important.
Only if I like job [np6,1-] , and the job may give me much enjoyment.
I hope [vp1,-1] got a job which is suitable what I have read.
So that I would have much and I would have much more to study more and more knowledge, and train myself many skills.
Some people like to work the same job [cc3,3-] for ever.
Because they feel if they change the jobs frequently, they will no [wd3,1-] succeed any job.
During the long time of work, they can learn how to do it and how to do best.They will be the expert in these fields.
But the other people are likely to change the jobs a lot.
They want to learn all kinds of abilities in difference jobs.
Every time they change the jobs, they will set the interest again.
I think these two kinds of attitudes all [wd3,s-] have their benefits.
When I am young, before I find the job I like best, I can do many kinds of jobs, training myself ,and get difference [wd2,-1] kinds of abilities.
But when I find the job I'm favor to, I will devote myself into [wd3,2-] it, will succeed soon.
Some people like to do a job in his [pr3,s-] life.
The reasons have two: first they think they are interested in the job and will do the job for ever.
Second ,they may have the job is very simple, and they may have a rich life.
Some people like to change their job, because they read [wd3,-3] a better job or they don't like to do a job in a long time.
My view on job hopping is the first one.
I like to do a job in my life, because I think a job contains many things, such as knowledge and mind [wd3,s-] .
A job which wants to do the best isn't a single thing.
It needs to spend much time and much spirit.
It needs to spend much time and much spirit.
In order to do the best, I will do a job all in [wd5,1-2] my life.
Some people want to go in for a single work all along.
The reason why they want to do so is not surprising.
First of all, the same work is familiar to them so that they can do it well.
Second, some people are so conservative that they do not like to risk something else.
On the other hand, someone else insist [vp3,2-] on [wd3,1-] alternative [wd3,-1] work that they prefer to [vp1,s-] .
Because they are looking forward to better life [np6,1-] , rather than the single life.
In a word, they'd like to risk something that they didn't [vp6,-s] experience.In my opinion, I'd like to pursuit [wd2,s-] a single work.
Because I want to do it better.
I believe I can achieve [vp1,-s] after with my confidence all along.
Some people like to go in for one job from the beginning till the end.
Because they like to be stable all the time.
These men like living a stable life.
They don't want to go here and there.
But some people like to go in for one job because they are to achieve great success in this field.
So they do the job without interruption.Some people like to change their jobs frequently because they want to attempt all kinds of jobs.
They can get much [np8,-1] experiences to [wd3,-2] these jobs.
So they can master much [np8,-1] skills.
Some people like to change their jobs because they like to advent [fm2,-] .
They like to live a splendid life.In my opinion, I like to change my job frequently because I want to get much experiences [np8,1-] to [wd3,-3] all kinds of job [np3,3-] and master much [np8,-1] skills.
Then I can be fit for the society better.
Furthermore, I like to live in different circumstances.
I like new circumstances.
So I like to change my job frequently.
Some bodys [fm1,-] like to do a work in a long time, because they do not like to face new challenge.Some bodys [fm1,-] like to change jobs, because they like to face new adventure.
In their lives every day is new.
In my mind, I will work in [wd3,-2] a job for a long time ever all my life, if I like it.
If I work in [wd3,-2] a job that I do not like, then I will intend to change, until I get the job which like.
Only the job which I like, I work for it, I can face excited, and challenged.
And I would do all my best for it, until make it best.
People have views whatsoever on job-hopping.
Some of them like to take one kind of work for ever, because they have an unchanged interest and believe they will make great progress sooner or later as the result of working hard.
Some of the rest people like to change work frequently, because they have variable [wd3,-1] interests and they will try their best to find which one can bring them complete success.
Between two of the front [wd3,1-] , I agree with the first.
I have only one purpose-being a boss who have [vp3,3-] a famous firm.
This aim isn't [vp9,-1] change ever since my boyhood.
And I am sure that I can turn it to truth.
Some people like to go on the same work in their lives, they say only the same work, you can learn more knowledge, and you would do your best, because work need [vp3,1-] the long time to study, while you have short time.
You can't do scientists [cc3,1-] .
If they didn't [vp9,-s] spent the long time ,ever their lives, they couldn't do anything in science.
But some people don't agree with [wd3,1-2] the opinion, they like to change their work.
The life is short, when you spend much time to go on the same work, your life is dark, not beautiful of the different.
If they couldn't write good article from the different experiences.
I think two opinions of the above have some reasons.
Some work need [vp3,2-] long time to do.
So the people like to do the same work and they can find interest from it, but I like to go on different work, and I think I can do my best in every work.
No labours, no gains.
No one could survive without labour.
So every one needs to have a job.
But to [wd3,-1] work people have many various [wd5,1-1] different views.
Some like to do one job constantly.
They are customed [fm1,-] to [pp1,3-3] do the same thing once and they are not fit for the variety of work.However some like to change work constantly.
They like new and fresh things.
They enjoy taking different things.
To me, my view on job-hopping is what job could fit me to do, and my abates [fm1,-] is enough to do it good [wd2,s-] .
I will enjoy taking it.Fits [wd3,-s] is the most important things on one's job-hopping.
Changing or not is not the most important things.
Some people prefer [vp1,2-4] to doing a kind of job from start to end, because they like the stable surrounding, that is to say, day by day more experience can be got.Others may prefer [vp1,2-4] to changing jobs frequently.
Most of them who that the young man are allays and barrette.
They have passion, hearty [wd3,1-] and barrette.
They prefer [vp1,1-5] to fresh things rather than old ones.
So changing jobs can give them a challenge to meet.My opinion is that do [vp4,-s] what I'm interested in.
Interesting is a basic factor.
If you don't like to do or have no interests [wd3,s-] , you may not have impulse to do it.
That is why many employer [np3,1-] may ask employ [wd3,s-] such [wd5,-2] the same question-what do you like to do?
What the occupation do you like to take?
and so on.
Everyone has his own view on job-hopping.
Someone likes [vp1,-1] do [wd4,1-1] same job all his life.
Because he thinks that the same job of long-period [fm2,-] will make him more skilled than others.
In this kind of job, it makes him have the sense of safety.Someone doesn't think so.
He thinks that the same kind of work limit [vp3,s-] his that thought and emanation [fm1,-] , but different jobs will give him different knowledge and they will help him do better than others.
So he often likes to change his job.
My view on job-hopping is that I must master a kind of skill and this skill should make sure that I have a good life.
Then I will make it possible to do different jobs.
I will have more chance and I will feel safe.
Some people like [vp1,-1] do a [np7,-2] same job from start to the end.
They have interesting in doing the same work.
They can enjoy the success from doing the same work better and better.While some others often like [vp1,-1] change the job.
Because they want to touch [vp1,-s] with the new thing and new people.
These people always like adventures.
They feel that the new job can give them new surprise.
This make [vp3,1-] their life more well [wd2,s-] .My view on job-hopping is do the same job.
At first, I will chance a job that I am interesting.
Then I keep studying the skill.
This will make me do the job much better than others.
I can get more successfully [wd2,s-] .
If I always change my work, I will always do worse then the others.
After all, a man's capital [fm1,-] is limit [vp9,1-] , I can not study all the skills very well.
If I do that, I will waste all my life and do nothing.
So my view on job-hopping is keep doing one job and do it best.
Somebody always like [vp3,2-] to do a kind of work because they think that the work is best.
The work make [vp3,1-] them happy.
Or they get much money from the work.
So they always do it.Some body like [vp3,1-] job-hopping.
After they always do the same work, they fell [fm1,-] that the work is boring.
The work is [vp9,-2] not suit for them.
They can't get the manger what need form the work.
So they like job-hopping.
My view on job-hopping is that I do what I like.If a kind of work make [vp3,s-] me unhappy or make [vp3,s-] me feel boring [aj4,1-] , I will give it up.
I will to [vp9,1-] find what I like.
But this is my private view.
I know the society is realities.
I don't have much chance of choice [wd2,1-] work.
Some people like [vp1,-s] work on a job seat [wd3,1-] .
They don't like [vp1,-s] change work environment.
They do the things that they have done from beginning.
There are [wd4,1-2] same people work [vp5,s-] with them, so they can help each other.
Then the work can finish [vp7,2-] queenly [fm1,-] .
But some people often change their jobs.
Every a [wd5,1-] new job can bring him new friends.
They must to [vp9,1-] suit [vp1,-s] for the new work so they have to learn new skill [np6,1-] .
Some people change work because they want [vp1,-1] have more money or have higher job seat [wd3,1-] .
I think man can have many jobs, but not to change too much.
To do a work best is not easy, we must spend many [np8,-1] time to do it.
Change a job, we will begin a new objection [wd3,s-] .
We must spend a lot of time to do it best.
Change so many work is not good for us do thing [np6,1-] well.
Some people like [vp1,-s] do a [np7,-1] same job for long time.
Because they have mastered how to do the job well.
So they don't spend much time in studding [fm1,-] how to work well.
In this condition, they have the stable income.
They perhaps are satisfied with the job and the life.
So they don't adjust himself [pr3,s-] to go on with a new job.
I think they like a smooth life.Some people like to change their job with him [pr3,s-] .
If they find that the job isn't fitted [vp7,2-] with him [pr3,s-] , they'll change to other job quickly.
Because they want to find a job which is fitted [vp7,2-] himself mostly.
So they can showed [vp9,1-] their ability.
They like to have new thing [np6,1-] in the job every day, don't like the same thing in the job.
I also don't like to do the same job for a very long time.
For example ten years or all over my life.
I can do a job in less [wd4,1-2] ten years.
After several years I'll have a bass [fm1,-] in my job.I think I'll change my job less [wd4,1-2] ten times in my [wd1,-1] all life.
Someone like [vp3,1-] doing one job and never change because they want a still life.
They don't like [vp1,-s] go here or there from time to time or they are afraid of new living situation.
This kind of men don't seem to succeed.Other [np6,-s] like often changing their jobs because they don't like a life never changing.
They want to see new things and different felling [fm1,-] .
This kind of men don't seem to succeed too.
My view on job-hopping is that seize every opptunity [fm1,-] you can if you want to succeed.
Don't change your job without goal.
If you change job [np6,1-] only for your pressure, you will never succeed, and come down to the world.
And don't container [wd3,-2] your job if there's other good job waiting for you.
You maybe [wd3,-s] lose a chance to come up to the world for your newer changing.
Everyone may have a view on working.
Someone like [vp3,1-] to going [vp1,3-2] in for a kind of work only because they are most interesting [aj4,-1] in it, they are tired of [pp1,2-2] change a job frequently.
They are used to do [vp5,3-] his favorite job and enjoy it.Someone like [vp3,1-] to changing [vp1,3-2] his job frequently because his hobby is wide [cc4,2-] , and he like [vp3,1-] to receive [wd3,-2] new things and enjoy it, this help [vp3,1-] him to improve his experience and skill.
I think I belong to the behead [wd3,1-] one.
Usually I can do are thing from start to end until finish it .
After finishing one thing I like to take in another so I like to change work.
The topic is very popular with the people all over the world.
There are two answers to the view on job-hopping.
Some people like doing only a job all their lives.
They thought they can do better in their job because of their special experience.
That they know better about the job will make their [pr4,1-] succeed in their work.
But there are other people insist that changing job frequently is good to them.
Because all kinds of the job would make them know much than only one kind of job.
They can use the knowledge they just learned from a job into [wd3,-3] the next job.
As far as I am concerned, I hold on the first view.
I though [fm1,-] any job needed a diligent person.
Only we take much time in the job we are doing, we can get the more.
The issue of employment has always been the concerning focus of the wholl [fm1,-] society.
The time is going on and people's view on job-hopping are [vp3,s-] changing too.
Some people like engaging in one kind of job consistently.
In Easten [fm1,-] World, such as China, Japan, most people hold this opinion.
It is partly influenced by the national culture.
These people aren't pleasant [wd3,s-] to change.
All they want or persuit [fm1,-] is a stable and peace [wd2,-1] life.
So they do a job only to earn money to leave [wd3,-1] on, even they don't interested [vp9,1-] in what they're doing.
To them, that's enough.
Whether these people like their job or not, they are sure to try their best to do everything well.
We can often see that people always serve one company in loyalty through their lives.
Unlike the people above-mentioned [fm2,-] , some persons change their job constently [fm1,-] .
For instance, most Americans are the typical examples.
They hate?stationery".
They more persuit [fm1,-] stimulativity [fm2,-] .
Besides they hope their job to be chanllegable [fm1,-] , so that they can show their capacity [wd3,2-] adequately.
In their views, changing is reasonable.
In my opionion [fm1,-] , people have free right to chose [vp5,4-2] a job.
Nowadays, people should change with the world.
In keen [wd3,-1] competitive society, people should think more about survival.
So I think, the correct attitude to chose [vp5,2-1] job [np6,1-] is that: everyone must select [wd3,-2] one position that he or she is interested in and compatable [fm1,-] to.
In the position, you're confident that you can do it much better than any other.
Of course, you should be qualified for it first.
So whether you change your job or not, is not important.
The critical thing is that you can do your work well and you're sure that it is the just work you need.
Someone only like [vp3,2-] a kind of work, because they think with the time passing.
they can get more and more experiments [wd3,s-] .
Of course, they may get more money from the work.
Another reason is maybe [wd5,s-] they like [vp1,-s] live clam [wd7,2-] .
But someone like [vp3,1-] [vp1,-s] change their job very frequently, because they think the more work they even had [vp6,-s] , the more chance [np3,1-] they can catch.
In order to get great achievement, they think they should challenge fate.
But I think one should apply for a work is relation to what he studyed [fm2,-] in school, so he can do it better.
If his work has nothing with he studied in school, he has to spend much time studying new knowledge [cc3,2-] .
So we should work hard in school so that we can gain sensitive achievement in a work after graduation.
Someone like [vp3,1-] doing the same job in his life.
They don't want to change.
However, There are many reasons.
First, somebody's job is [vp9,-2] very fit for him.
The job can make him use his ability enough, he feel [vp3,1-] very happy.
Second, somebody is afraid of competition.
They fear [vp1,-s] of facing different enviomences [fm1,-] and people.
Sometimes, it means starting again, and must spend more time.
But other people often like changing job [np6,1-] .
They think changing job [np6,1-] brings them chances, they can learn many things from changing job [np6,1-] , such as knowledges [fm2,-] , the ability of living, the attitude of living, the relationship of people.
My views of job-hopping is changing job can make me better about life, study, and work.
So I like changing job [np6,1-] .
Some don't like to change their job.
They only want to do a [np7,-2] same job in their lives.
They think that the time and the energy are limited, so they can't have enough time and energy to changing [vp5,6-] job [np6,1-] .
And do kinds of job can't make them do well on jobs.
At the same time, they think it is trouble to change a job, because they must learn new knowledge and adapt new work conditions.But some like to changing [vp1,4-1] jobs.
There are some reason [np3,3-] .
Firstly, some think it can practice their capacity; secondly, it affort [fm1,-] a chance to study new knowledge and broad [wd2,-2] their eyesight's [fm1,-] .
thirdly [fm3,-] , it is a opportunity to compete.
So they like to change jobs.
I think it is benefit [wd2,s-] to change jobs.
In one's life, changing jobs can make life more wonderful and interesting.
Nowadays, people have different attitude to the job-hopping.
Some people like to contribute all their life to [wd4,1-2] same job.
But others rather than change their works [wd3,1-] more often.
In fact, people have different attitudes towards the job because they live in different environment [np6,1-] or they have different view on life.The people that like to contribute all their life to [wd4,1-2] same job may be very interested in [wd4,1-2] some job, or are forced by parents [np6,1-] , friends..., even or have no confidence to join in other work.
That people [np3,1-] who more like to change job [np6,1-] maybe [wd3,s-] feel the job no chanleging [fm1,-] ,or they think that to do different job is enjoyment, and so on.
I think that we should do according by [wd5,s-] ourselves.
There is a debate on job-hopping, some people say it is good for one to do [wd4,1-2] same job, others say it is good for one to do the various kinds of jobs.
Why do they stand for their view?
People who say it is good to do the same job think the same job gives them steady wages, practices their basic background skills, makes them live more comfortable [wd2,s-] .People who say it is good to do the various kinds of jobs have another view.
They think various jobs give them intensions [fm1,-] , adjust them to society, give them changledgings [fm1,-] .As a undergraduate, my view on job-hopping is using what I have studied in the university for the benefits of people.
In my spare time, I do another job that is relative [wd3,1-] to my subject to make much progress of my social abilities, to do my best for the benefit of country [np6,1-] .
There are all kinds of people in the world, and everyone has his own view about job-hopping.
Some people seems [vp3,1-] more like a single job than a [np7,-1] alternative job in his whole life.
They think that a single job can make them more skillful on it, while alternative job [np6,1-] need [vp1,-s] them always learn new knowledge [cc3,2-] .
But some people like alternative job [np6,1-] rather than a single job, they think that alternative job [np6,1-] can make their knowledge more comprehensive, while a single job restrict them on a single life.
To [pp2,-2] my opion [fm1,-] about job-hopping, I think that if everyone can find a job which fit [vp3,s-] him and he also like [vp3,1-] it, he needn't always want to alternate [wd3,s-] it just because other people do.
But if the job isn't fit [vp9,1-1] for him, he should took [vp9,1-] [vp1,-1] for another job which is fit [vp9,1-1] for him .
I hope all people can fined their own job which they like!
Many people likes [vp3,2-] to engage in a kind of job all along [wd5,1-2] the time.
Because they think a fixed job can bring them a stable position and a skilled work procedure [cc4,2-] .
If a job was often changed, they would try to fit [vp9,1-1] in it every time, and this will expend [wd3,-s] them much time and energy.
But other people likes [vp3,1-] to change the job oftenly [fm2,-] .
Because they think different job can bring them different feeling, if they have a new job, it will make him a new position, the other side [pp2,2-] , a fixed job is no taste, it would make man a bad behavior, lose the interesting [wd3,1-3] of the living.
I think, a man can't change the job time and time [wd7,2-] but also can't fix [wd3,s-] on a job from time to time if you [pr1,s-] think it is unfit [vp9,1-] for you.
Why?
Because you can't maste [fm1,-] the skill about your work is a short time, if you change the job oftenly [fm2,-] , you will have nothing on [wd3,-2] you living.
But, if you have lose [vp9,1-] interested [wd3,1-] in a job you have taken a long time, still you can't put your heart on it, if you want to make a great progress in your remained [wd3,-1] living, you'd better change a job, in ordor [fm1,-] to exposed your skill [cc3,2-] enough and make a great achievement in your job, so the job can't be changed oftenly [fm2,-] , but if you find it not fit for you, you must change it as soon as possible.
<ST 4> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <AGE ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 1> <WAY 1> <TITLE My view on Job-Hopping> <SCH 2541> <SCORE 6> <ID 430819>
Their [wd3,-5] are two kinds of man [np3,3-] .
One kind tend [vp3,2-] to do only one kind of work for long time.
Because they interested on [aj2,1-] this work very much.
From the work, they can gain much fun.
Or they think they had [vp6,-s] do [vp9,1-] the work very skill [wd2,s-] , and not tend to change their work.The other tend [vp3,1-] to often change their work.
Because they think the work they doing [vp4,1-] soon become [vp3,s-] uninterested [aj4,-1] , the new work can give them new interesting [wd3,s-] .
Or they love the challendge [fm1,-] of new work.
I think, pay [vp4,-s] close attention to one work is a food banner, because it can make us do this work more and more effciencely [fm1,-] and improve the productive [wd2,s-] .
New work can give us new challendge [fm1,-] .
From new work we can learn more knowledge.
More knowledge can make us more creative.
We mustn't change work because it's uninteresting, or tend to do one work because lazy to learn new knowledge.
In a word, working hard, facing the challendge [fm1,-] .
All of us will succeed.
Some persons like to do only one work in their whole life.
Because the hate to change their work.
They think that when they only do one work, they can get more achievement in this work.
But if they often change it, they may get only a little achievement in any work.
But the other persons like to change they work.
Because they like to meet with new challenges and opportunities.In new work [np6,1-] , they find themselves have new opportunities again.
In my opinion, we can change our work because we must do those [np8,-1] work that we can interest [vp7,2-] in .
But we couldn't change it too often.
Because changing the work means that we have to return to the starting -point of our work.
But our life are [vp3,1-] limited, we can't always return to [wd4,1-1] starting-point.
Some people like to do a [wd3,-1] job all time.
For one thing, they think that that job fits [vp1,-1] to them and they can do somethings [fm2,-] in that job.
For another, they are afraid [aj2,-1] to challenges, they fear [vp1,-1] to find a new job, like to do a job with good paid [wd3,1-] .
But some people like to do all kinds of jobs usually [wd3,s-] .
They change their jobs because they like to [wd5,1-1] challenges, they want to turn out their abilities, they can keep up with the times.
And it's also possible that they dislike their jobs where they work at present.
In order to gain a better paid [wd3,1-] , they prefer to a new job.
I think that people should change their job when their abilities aren't be [wd5,1-] used or the boss dislike [vp3,1-] them.
But when the jobs are [vp9,-1] fit to them, they can achieve sucess [fm1,-] in their jobs, they should stay and do their jobs better.
It is said that someone hope [vp3,1-] their jobs all along not changing.
They think that they can make focus [cc3,1-] on the Job [fm3,-] and do the job better.
They can have expericement [fm1,-] on the similar Jobs [fm3,-] .
Someone think [vp3,1-] they would like [vp1,-1] change job [np6,1-] all the way.
They say they must find a job that fit [vp9,1-2] in for them.
And they think they can have all kinds of expericements [fm1,-] through finding job [np6,1-] .
They think if they out of work, they can find another work right away.
My view on job-hopping is that if I find a job fitting for [wd5,1-] me, then I will not change the Job [fm3,-] again.
I must make focus [cc3,1-] on the job, and do some achievement [cc3,2-] .
If the job is unfit [vp9,1-] for me, I wouldn't stop [vp1,-1] find job until the job is fit [vp9,1-1] for me.
I will like to the job what my choose.
Every people [np3,1-] has his or her own view on job-hopping.
Some people who intend to take only [wd4,-1] kind of job in their whole life are in the view of the stable job can offer them stable life and the chances of being promoted.
They maybe [wd5,-s] also think that just engaging [vp7,2-] in one kind of job can let them fit for the job more perfectly.
On the other hand, there are some people like changing their jobs frequently.
They want to hunt for a more satiable job for them by job-changing.
They also want to promote their position through job-changing.
But my view on job-hoping is diffent [fm1,-] from the above.
If one that doesn't like his own job or the is not suitable for him, he still work [vp3,1-] in the stable position, just for the promotion by his experience.
This kind of view is not correct.
But if one in order to find a suitable job changes his job frequently, he will faild [fm1,-] sometimes.
According to my view on job-hopping, if one take [vp3,1-] no insteresting [fm1,-] in his present job or isn't suitable for his present job can change his job.
But people can't often change their job because they must spend most time fitting for the new job.
In real life, some people like to engage in a [np7,-1] same job all the way.
These people have a purpose from their childhood that they want to be in the future.
And they always work hard towards the purpose.
After enter [vp5,1-] into a career which they like and have ability to do it quite well.
So they don't want to change another job, which causes they study the others from the begining [fm2,-] .
However, there are also some people who like to change their careers.
These people often like adventure and chanllage [fm1,-] .
They think changing job [np6,1-] will help them to acquire much more knowledge and ability which they can cope with more practical problems in the real life.
Of course, there are other factors make them change their job.
For example, their present job is lower [wd3,-1] paid or their bosses are too hard to get along with.
As I think ,both thinkings [fm1,-] have their right reasons [cc4,1-] .
I'm a student of [wd4,1-4] department of computer science.
After graduation I will do the job all the way about computers, because I like it.
Also, I think I'm quite suit [vp9,2-] for doing computer work.
The word?Haste makes waste?is very reasonable.
The word says that if we do every thing, we should step by step.
then [fm3,-] we can be succeed [wd2,-] .
We know, that every thing according to it's own order.
We can't change it [pr1,s-] .
We must obey it.
If we don't, we can do nothing.
For example, once there lived a farmer, he was worried [aj1,2-3] to see that the crops were very small, then he pulled the crops from the land.
The next day, when he saw the crops again, the crops had been dead.
The story tell [vp3,1-] us, that "One step could not go to sky".
We must try our bests [vp2,2-1] to do everything and obey the natural orders, obey the things' orders.
One day, we will be succeeded [wd3,s-] .
"Haste makes waste" is an old saying of our country.
It contains two meanings.One is that if you want to succeed, you should firstly be patient.
The other is if you are too impatient, your goal will otherwise difficult to reach.
The reason of "haste makes waste" [np1,-] is that only hard work lead [vp3,1-] to success and to complete a hard work needs a long time.
You may want to be a teacher in your childhood.
Certainly you couldn't turn your dream into practice [wd3,3-] in one night.
You must learn Arithmetic [wd3,1-] , Chinese, physics and other basic course [np3,2-] in your primary school, and high school.
Then after years of above mentioned knowledge's study you will learn how to make a student learn fastly [fm2,-] and well in the Normal university.
Then after your [wd2,1-1] graduated [vp6,-s] from the Normal university, you really become a teacher.
You will see how it is to reach a goal, to catch a success [cc3,2-] .
Contrastly [fm2,-] , if you raise a purpose [cc3,2-] today to be teacher, and you want to teach in the classroom tomorrow.
Can't you imagine how you will teach and how much the students will know you?
"Where there is a will, there is a success".
This is another Chinese old saying, work hard and patiently, you will get your purpose in the end.
You may usually hear people say "haste makes waste", however, do you know what it mean.
Sometimes, people must do something in very short time.
So they want [vp1,-1] do very fast.
But they often forget some essential procedures.
When they remind [wd3,s-] , they have to do it again.
So they finish it more later [aj3,1-] than normal or finish it imperfectly.
For example, you hurry to catch on the train.
When you reach the station, you find [vp1,-s] leave off the ticket on the table.
After you return for the ticket and arrive again, the train has gone off.
You want to hurry.
But inversly [fm1,-] , you miss the train.
As we know,"Haste makes waste" [np1,-] refers simply to the faster one does, the fewer one gets, why ?
Because no matter what we do or will do, we must conform to the natural law.
If we breach [wd3,s-] it, the natural law will punish us.
Finally, we aren't not [wd5,1-] only advance a step, but also back a step.
For example, the wheat grows too slow, it must grow by using of [wd5,1-] necessary water, sunshine, soil.
If one want [vp3,1-] it to grow faster and pull it higher, the wheat will dead due to loss enough water, soil.
It [pr1,-s] is also right in economic field.
In 1956, [wd4,-3] Chinese government want [vp3,1-] to make more iron, and take all steal of whole country to product [wd2,s-] the iron.
It result [vp3,1-] in the consequence that producted [fm1,-] iron was almost substandard product, in the meantime, the steal was also used up.
The thing wastes plenty of labor, finicial [fm1,-] and raw material, and bring about our economic ability is latter than other countries of the world for many decade years.
So when we do anything, we should comply with the natural law.
?Haste makes waste ?is a common truth.
The development of anything is a process of making progress.
It is from the low to the high.
If we want to get a success., we must work hard.
But it is not enough to work hard.
We have to consider the conditions we have.
Only we have the necessary conditions, we maybe [wd5,s-] get a success.
Or our efforts will waste [vp7,2-] .
For example, long ago there was a farmer in China.
On a winter day he walked in his farm saw his wheat too small.
He felt his wheat's growth slow ,so he decided to help them by his hand.
He draged [fm1,-] them higher than before.
After done this, he was happy.
But several days later, all his wheat died.
From this story, we can draw a conclusion "Haste makes waste.
"
Everyone wants to make things not only good but fast.
But if you only want to use the fastest way to do something.
Usually, you may have a neither good nor fast reward.
Because haste makes waste.
Doing things too hurry will make you careless, ever [fm1,-] make things be done worse.
Sometimes you must spend more time doing the things.
For example, when you drive a car to attend an important meeting.
When you see the red light, you must stop you car.
Otherwise you'll have to use more time to cope with policemen.
As the same reason as our studying, we eager to reach good study and to use time fully.
But we shall have chart [wd3,-2] for study and go over the lesson everyday.
We can't only want to study quickly, forget interview [wd3,-2] all lesson.
?Go over will let you know new knowledge".
We won't do things the most quickly because haste makes waste.
?Haste Makes waste?
mainly means that someone eager to get something but can't reach it in the end.
Why?
Because everything has it's own develop [wd2,-1] stage.
And each of them can't be avoided.
For example, when we study something, first we must have a general look at it.
Then through learning it we slowly understand it.
At last we waste it.
There are three stages, we shall do it in sequence.
It is impossible to reach the third stage without the first and the second stages.
We should do everything quickly and well.
Not only fast but also good.
If you only do things fast but neglect [vp1,-1] to really understand it, it is no use.
"Haste Makes Waste" [np1,-] tell us that we shall do everything carefully.
Faster is base on understanding.
Thus we can do things successfully.
We often want to finish a work in a short time, so we can use more spare time to do other things.
But haste often makes waste.
Because we can not do every thing well in so short time.
If some thing in it [wd5,1-] is failure, we would have to do it again.
It would need more time.
So we can say "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
" For example, as a student we [pr3,s-] often want to read a book in a short time.
So we can read more books.
In order to read it [pr3,s-] fast, we read each passage quickly and can't understand what it means.
When you finish reading it and the other man asks what it says, perhaps you can say nothing.
So I think we must do everything carefully in our life and can't want do it fast than normally.
Success is tempting to everyone, and it is the fruit of one's sweat, struggle, even life.
so we couldn't obtain it easily in face of difficulties or danger.
Second we also should persist to [wd3,1-1] it, struggle for it until obtain it.
Third we should hold scientific method, discover the access to success.
In a sense, efforts is [vp3,1-] the first of all factors.
The way to success is not easy.
Before the success, we can't be anxious.
In face of danger, we must have self-confidence and devote greater efforts to it.
For a [wd5,1-1] example, a boxer before his success he must practice much and suffer from a great deal of blow that few people can endure.
If he gives up halfway.
he can't achieve the success.
The efforts that he did is waste [wd7,s-] .
There is a kind of general idea to say that haste makes waste.
I think it is true.
Once a man want [vp3,1-] to succeed through the way of rapid speed, he will not realize his dream.
During the courses of haste, you may forget many factors important to your work, and you have only an idea to succeed in a short time.
What you can't think of is if you spend less time in working or studying, moreover [wd3,s-] , you can't think over the problems relevant to the work, you will not get at your purpose.
So we can say Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
In fact, there are many things like that in our lives.
For example, when you study English, you wish to remember the words quickly, so you read quickly and are anxious of mastering them in a short time.
However, you get lower efficiency.
You can't realize your idea [cc3,2-] .
Then, you waste much time in remembering such words.
We shall think over the words, then remember them.
By means of this, we can succeed quickly.
In a word, a man shall not hurry up in working or studying.
Only after thinking over, we can go to finish the work, or haste will make waste.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ", it's means [vp9,1-] if we want to reach our point we expected.
But usually we can't get it as we want .
The more faster [ad3,1-] we want, the more difficult that [wd5,s-] we get it .
As we have a wonderful hop, and we will try our best to obtain it.
But at the same time we can do [vp1,-1] with the things confidently and carefully.
We can't predict the difficulties that we will face to [wd5,1-] and have not a good ready.
Then when the difficulties came [vp6,-s] to us, we usually can't comfit [wd3,-1] it well.
So the result is that we have to accept the defeat.
For example.
Someone want [vp3,1-] to be a running champion.
But he hasn't analysis [wd2,1-] his own conditions and can't have a long-time running every morning and attend the race of the running.
The result must be the defeating [wd3,s-] .
So as we do somethings [fm2,-] , We must avoid "Haste Makes Waste" .
 [np1,-] We should try our best for our own proposal [wd3,s-] .
As we all know, we shouldn't do anything hurriedly or else we'll fail to do it well.
When doing a thing, we should do it step by step, while not haste to do it, if we have to do it.
It will make waste.
In our everyday life, there are many examples like this.
For instance, the students who take part in the Band Six Contest [wd3,2-] should study English every day, learn more new words by heart, doing [vp5,-s] much reading, little by little, their listening and reading comprehension will be made great progress doing like this.
The possibility of passing the Band Six exam will be greater.
However if he often doesn't study English carefully, He [fm3,-] will fail to pass it.
All in all, when we want to do anything well, we should do it from less to more.
Step by step, thus we can succeed, or it [pr1,s-] can only lead to "Haste [fm3,-] makes wastes".
 [np1,-] <ST 4> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <AGE ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 1> <WAY 1> <TITLE Haste Makes Waste> <SCH 2207> <SCORE 7> <ID 430409>
Most people usually like [vp1,-1] haste when they doing something.
But this will result in an opposite end [wd3,2-] .
You are necessary to remember: ?Haste [fm3,-] Make [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] !?
Haste reflects the strong will of our desire to success [wd2,s-] .
But we can't benefit from it.
First it often make [vp3,1-] us overestimate ourselves.
We perhaps make a plan beyond reach with it.
We will feel dispressed [fm1,-] when we don't carry out it.
Second, it also make [vp3,2-] us daydream.
Because of it [pr1,s-] we can't concentrate on our work.
For example, if you eager to pass a exam you will feel frightened when you are doing it.
This you will do worse than usual.
I often have a bad habit of haste, it makes me bad records in some tests.
We all know that ?Haste [fm3,-] make waste".
Why it is ?
I think that everything to be realized has a across.
If someone doesn't know this, he will make a failure.
For example, my brother was a student of one middle school.
He didn't do well in English.
He asked me to help him improve his English.
So I made a plan of English study for him.
At [pp2,-2] [wd4,1-2] first week he complied with the plan.
Everyday he got up at 6 o'clock to read the English lesson.
But a week passed, he told me that he still did not pass the English text [wd3,3-] and he gave it up.
The English study need [vp3,s-] a lot of time.
No one can learn it well in a short time.
This is the "Haste [fm3,-] make waste".
 [np1,-] 
What is "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] "?
 [np1,-] It implies that if one wants to do something more quickly, he may get the inverse [wd3,-1] consequence.
The consequence is not the one that he wants to obtain.
Then why does it happen?
Because when you are in hurry, you must be anxious and impatient.
This will lead to your behaviour in unconsistence [fm1,-] .
So it is natural that you can't obtain your expective [fm2,-] result.
In our lives, it [pr1,-s] is common.
I have an uncle who works in a factory.
One day he wanted to buy something in a supermarket.
The supermarket is not far from his home.
He could get to [wd5,1-1] there on foot.
But in order to save time, he drived [fm2,-] his car.
Unfortunately in [pp2,-2] the way to the supermarket, there was a choke [wd3,s-] .
He had to wait for some time.
If he had been on foot, he would have finished shopping.
From this example, we can conclude that in some conditions, you should select the correct way to do something.
Or else you will obtain the consequence that you don't want.
We often think of such a sentence as ?as soon as possible?when we are doing something in hurry, and then make the whole thing even worse.
This is"haste makes waste".
 [np1,-] Why "haste makes waste"?
 [np1,-] That usually because when we do something hurriedly, we often can't make our mind conscious completely.
There are [vp3,-5] not a very clear thought of doing something former [wd3,s-] or later, and the things get mass.
For example, as we often met [vp6,-s] in life, one day you get up too late, there was [vp3,1-3] only three minutes left for you to go to school.
You may forget to bring the papers with you which the professor will use in the class, and you can do nothing about it.
Another example, when you want to finish your work quickly so as to do something else, you will find a lot of mistakes in your work then.
Therefor, haste makes waste.
You may ask, why haste makes waste?
Haste is good, because it means fast to do a thing.
It can raise the product rate.
But mostly we can't do the thing well.
Sometimes, it led [vp6,-s] the thing we want to do more badly.
That's to say, haste makes waste.
For example, you drive your car fastly [fm2,-] in order not to be late for work.
In the road, suddenly, a litter [fm1,-] boy run [vp3,1-] across the street, but you are late, the car struck down the boy.
You not only are late for work, but also led [wd3,-2] a [np7,-1] accident.So haste usually makes waste.
Today, we always go after efficiency when we do the things.
So we do all the jobs rapidly.
It is reasonable partially, but as the old saying goes: haste makes waste.
I agree [vp1,-1] it, every thing has its own stages [wd3,s-] and procedures, it is objective and can't be freely changed by us.
We should do it from the beginning or step by step, finally to the end.
If we only attend [wd3,-2] the speed, we might omit [wd3,-2] many details or we might be careless, all these may lead to failing [wd3,1-] doing the things.
For examples, when I was in high school, I was afraid to do mathematics exercise.
I always tried doing it quickly, but however anxious I was, I couldn't solve it smoothly.
Later, my teacher told me, before you did it, you'd better go over the notes and the examples, after you had understand [vp9,1-] it.
You can do the exercise.
I did so, and the result was good.
So we would remember the old saying: haste makes waste.
It is right.
People often say?Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ?.
But why they say?Haste Makes Waste?.
I think if we do a thing, we must do it step by step.
If we do the thing very fast, we'll fail on [wd3,-1] it.
For example: if we study English.
Firstly we must study English from A, B, C. Secondly, we study words, sentences, grammar and so on.
Thirdly, we can read, write, listen and speak.
If we firstly study speaking, writing, listening and reading, we'll felt [vp9,1-] very difficult.
Lastly, We'll lose [vp9,1-] intersted [fm1,-] in English.
We won't be able to study English well.
We must study English step by step.
At last, we'll study English very well.
A lot of things [wd4,-1] like this.
?Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ?.
If you want to do things successfully, you must remember "Haste [fm3,-] makes Waste [fm3,-] ".
There is a well-known saying: Haste makes waste.
It telles [fm1,-] us we shouldn't pay attention to the speed of a process alone.
But why?
There are two aspects in a process: quality and speed.
If we put too much our energy and too many resources on the speed, quality must be ignored.
Then as a result, we can't get a good result.
We have a good example in the economic history of our country to illustrate what is said above.
In 1958 the authorities called on the people all over the town [wd3,s-] to work hard to accelerate the speed of national economy.
So many people throughout the country began to meld [fm1,-] iron to improve the product of steel in very poor situation that the steel melt is of no use.
So our economy didn't develop as expected.
But many complaints were got by the authorities.
So whatever we do, we should work to get not only the speed but also the quality.
We usually say?Haste [fm3,-] makes waste?.
Do you know why?
I think it refers to the plan and action's process.
It is a truth as we all know.
We can say many examples [cc3,2-] around us: We'll have a test, but we don't study hard at [wd3,-1] usual.
So just before the exam, we borrow a lot of books about "Haste" [wd7,s-] ,this is useless.
All the "Hastes " [fm1,-] are based on the basic learning.
Hard working can make us success [wd2,s-] , the "Hastes"is just a kind of help.
For another example, when we learn English, the new words is [vp3,1-] a very important part.
We should learn it everyday and relate [vp1,-s] for a long time, the"Haste" can't help us, if we believe "Haste [fm3,-] makes success", we'll be false [wd3,-] .
So I think ?Haste makes waste?.
If we want to succeed, we should learn step by step.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] " is a proverb, which express [vp3,3-] that preparation is helpful before you do a thing, and haste perhaps doesn't do good for the thing.
You may ask why.
Now I think everyone wants to complete a thing sooner, but if you don't investigate it ahead and make preparations for it, you will not do it effectly [fm2,-] .
On the contrary, you have to hurry and [wd4,-1] anxious, but can't do it well.
Now I will give you an example to express [wd3,s-] it.
You know I am a student.
I want to get a good record.
Once I stayed at classroom for long time a day.
I studied without necessary rest.
I went to bed so late.
Because I wanted to be a "good" student.
But in the end of the term, I always feel headache and other sick feelings too.
Of course my study didn't improve.
Through this fact, I know I couldn't haste, I must study gradually and prepare the course exactly.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] " is a truth.
Please remember it when you do everything.
How to do a thing well?
It may include the following several sides [wd3,s-] .
First, one must grasp how to do it, it's [wd3,-3] technology and ways.
For example, if you attend a computer exam, however, you even unknow [fm2,-] the keyboard of it, you will be failed.
Second, you should have spent your time on it and could oparate it skilled [wd2,s-] .
This is like running a car, whether you only know it well but hadn't cost [wd3,-1] time to learn how to run it, you couldn't do it as usual.
So before we do whatever [wd3,s-] , we must learn it well and pay our attention on [vp2,2-] it for some time.
After we mastered it completely, then we can do it perfectly.
In alls [fm2,-] , we should be patient and hard [wd7,s-] to face everything, try our best to do everything well, haste only makes waste!
Every one of us wants to do the things rapidly and orderly.
But the frequent phenomena [cc4,1-] is [vp3,1-] that haste makes waste.
What does cause the phenomena high on earth?
There are several reasons as follow: first, the speed may influence the efficiency.
We usually make the things only in speedy manner not in quality manner.
The result often is what we don't want when we merely do the things rapidly.
The quick operate [wd2,s-] is often careless and smoothlers [fm1,-] .
Second, the feeling of doing the things may influence the result.
When we want to finish a duty in quick manner, the mind is often nervous and cautious.
So the result is often bad.
For example, when we take part in a [np7,-1] examination, everyone want [vp3,1-] to finish the test in time or on [pp2,-1] advance, because of nervous [wd2,1-] or careless [wd2,s-] , the mistakes is [vp3,1-] unavoid [fm2,-] .
When we do our house work, we often do worse than ever because of wanting a high speed.
From above station [wd3,s-] , we conclude that impatient [wd2,-s] and carefulness are necessary when we do every things.
Generally, the quality is first important and the speed is second.
Only when we is [vp3,1-] very familiar with our duty, the high speed and good quality are attained at the same time.
"Haste makes Waste" [np1,-] means if you want to do something successfully, you shouldn't want to succeed at once.
Because you do something very Hasty [fm3,-] .
Can't offer you quality wanted [wd7,4-] .
The quality isn't good meads [wd3,-1] defeat.
That is to say can't arrive [vp1,-s] your object.
Fox example, a person wanted [vp6,-s] to study the knowledge [cc3,2-] of accounting to look for a job.
He read the book of accounting day and night in a month.
Then he think [vp3,1-] he has mastered accounting knowledge and get be [wd7,1-2] able to be a accountant.
Then he attend [vp3,1-] the examination to qualify himself to be a accountant.
But he hasn't pass the examination.
What is the reason?
Because the knowledge of accounting is complex.
He didn't study carefully while read [vp4,-s] it quickly so that he couldn't master it.
So he couldn't pass the examination.
The example tell [vp3,1-] us: haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
My dear friends, I have something to speak with you: If [wd4,-s] want to do something and you want to succeed in it, you should do your best and have a pace after a pace [wd3,4-] .
Otherwise you will not succeed.
Because "Haste [fm3,-] Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] "
Every person knows that time is invaluable, so some people are always in a hurry.
But, on the other hand, every one must know haste makes waste.
When you do things in a hurry, you will find that time is always not enough.
When the rate of success is low, because you will forget many facts of act, or take something by mistake.
For an example, you are having a test, and you want to finish the test ahead of time.
So you have to write quickly.
At the same time you will find your handwriting is very poor.
As a result, the teacher of the subject you write about will have a discount [wd7,s-] to your score.
Now, you can see haste makes waste.
 [np1,-] 
If you want to do something in a hurry, you must feel anxious.
When a man hastes to do the work, he always can't finish it successfully.
Five years ago, I studyed [fm2,-] in a small town.
One day, my mother asked me to help her to lift the water away home.
She let me lift less than her.
At that time, I was still young, but I want to finish the task in no time.
So I didn't do as what she said and lifted much more.At the begining [fm1,-] , I could lift it quickly.
After a while, I was very tired, but, I tried, suddenly I fell into [wd3,-2] the road.
My mother came up to me, staring at me and saying:?Not anxious [wd3,s-] whatever you do.
Haste Makes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] .
Why do we say "Haste makes waste"?
because [fm3,-] every thing has its own content [wd3,s-] .
We should operate it according to its steps.
If one of them is disappeared [vp1,s-] , the thing will be bad or useless.
For example.
If you want to learn English.
First, you should be able to read so and so, and then, you ought to learn words, based on which, you will understand a long report written with English.
But if you haven't accorded [wd3,-3] to these steps, you will never learn English very well.
Of course when you can rember [fm1,-] many words, so that you are able to read newspaper or about [wd5,s-] English magazines, you ought to continue [vp1,-1] read the words you have learned before and read the new words you haven't known.
If you do so, your English level [wd5,1-] will be better, otherwise, you only know one letter or the few words, and never learn well.
Chinese often say: ?haste makes waste?.
If you determine to do something well, you should do it step by step.
In case you want to get the purpose of it [pr1,s-] much faster, then you will not work hard but want [vp1,-1] get it at once.
Finally, you'll not succeed in doing it.
For example, five years ago my classmates and I decided to climb the mountain near our school.
Firstly, I said to classmates [np6,1-] :?If we run to it, and we can get there at 10:00?.
Then we all ran fast, but soon we tired.
And when we got there, it was 2:00 P.M. Another time, I determined to pass Maths [fm2,-] exam two years ago, especialy [fm1,-] I wanted to got [vp5,2-3] a high score.
So I thought some of the questions could not ask.
If I wrote down the questions I thought it had, I could get to pass it and get a high score.
But, finally, I had only a score of 65 in the exam.
In a word, you should not do anything faster than you can.
You should do everything step by step.
In Chinese, there is an idiom-haste makes waste.
Every one of us expect [vp3,4-] to do a thing both well and quickly.
But it is too difficulty to realize.
Because the development of everything has its own sequence and we can't break it.
Additionally, the ability is limited.
If we do thing [np6,1-] too fast, mistakes will be inevitable.
They will be the direct obstacles on our way to the goal.
We know that the ?quantity?doesn't mean the same as the ?quality?.
For example, we all began to learn English from [wd5,-3] several years ago.
Though I'm not very good at it.
I think no one could be at the same level as me in three days.
I used to endure [wd3,s-] to recite all the cet 6 words in a week.
But I failed.
The use of words is complicated.
My ability of memorization is limited.
I'm not a superman.
And the new words made me more puzzled.
So I think haste makes waste.
Many people believe that haste makes waste.
As we know, this idea is much well conductive thought to do anything.
For example, learning English is usually done by the sequence of listening, speaking, reading, writing.
If you don't so by this sequence, it is very difficulty to well [wd1,-2] grasp English.
A man learns to walk firstly [wd2,s-] , and to run.
It is only a dream for you to run without doing the excesses of walking.
Just as we study in school, we almost experience the period of the primary school, the middle school, the college by step [np2,1-] .
It can be hurry to eat the heating?Dou Fu?, or it will injure your mouth.
So we say that haste makes waste.
The achievements are created by depending on hard working by steps.
Only if we do things act on the steady steps, we are successful men.
It is well known that ?Haste Makes Waste ".
It means that you will not succeed if you do things in a hurry.
As we all know, we must spend much energy and time if we want to do something well.
There is no difficult things in the world.
With the patience and time goes on,we can succeed.
So it is important not to do things hurrily [fm2,-] .
For example, when we studying, we must see to "Haste [fm3,-] Wakes [fm3,-] Waste [fm3,-] ".
 [np1,-] Because comprehension need [vp3,1-] time.
If we want to grasp the meaning of the texts, we must read it again and again, till we can understand it entirely.
Another example is that before we step into the society, we must put all the energy on studying other than finding a job in a hurry.
If you make a great success in your studying, it is no difficult to find your position in society.
So we can say,?Haste Makes Waste?.
final exam.
I was afraid I couldn't finish the paper, so when the exam began, I tried my best to hurry up.
Only with the result that I had done many problemes [fm1,-] which I do know with wrong, [wd3,1-] and I had to spend time to correct them.
Finally, I had many problems left.
That was [vp6,-s] , I failed to [wd3,1-] the Foxbase
final exam.
Haste makes waste.
When you begin to do something, the first you should do is to take yourself in calm.
 [cc3,4-] 
In the developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality has [vp3,s-] changed a lot since [wd3,-3] these 30 years.
Seen from the chart given above, the life expectancy has changed from 40 years to 60 years old in the past 30 years.
And the infant mortaility [fm1,-] in 1960 is 200 deaths per 1,000 birs [fm1,-] , while it is 100 deaths per 1000 birs [fm1,-] in 1990.
That is, people live longer in 1990s than in the past 30 years.
And a short [wd3,s-] number of babies died [vp6,-1] now.
From the results, peope [fm1,-] can realize [cc3,s-] the reasons that caused the changes.
For one thing, the developing countries are richer and stronger than before.
So the people's living conditions are better than before.
For another, with the development of the science, people have more and more way [np3,3-] to treat the diease [fm1,-] .
And the good conditions made [vp6,s-] people more and more healthful [wd3,s-] .
With the development of the society, health gains have been changed a lot.
The life expectancy and the infant mortality both have differently [wd2,1-1] changes in recent years.
From the above graph, we can see the changes of the life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] between 1960 to 1990.
First we see the life expectancy.
In 1960 the average life was 40 years old, while in 1990 the average life was 60 years old.
Secondly, the infant mortality in 1960 is 20 percent, but it is only 10 percent in 1990.
Why did [wd4,s-] have these great changes?
The reasons are very [cc6,-1] many.
First because of the improvement of the level of the people's life.
All kinds of food are supplied.
 [wd4,-2] Second reason is the development of the economy, people can use much money to buy what they want, so it [pr1,s-] can be meet [vp9,2-] the body's needs.
Third, that is most important in my opinion, is the advanced medical technology, it is because [wd5,-3] of this reason that makes the disease become slight and make people healthy.
There are other reasons if you want to find out.
But I can [wd4,1-2] sure that health gains will still [wd3,s-] have great changes in the future.
The people of developing countries are becoming more and more healthy.
According to the statistics, the life expectancy of the people has increased from 1960's 40 years old to 1990's 60 years old in developing countries.
On the other hand, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] decreased rapidly.
In 1960, it was 200 deaths per 1000 births, however, it had dropped to 100, in 1990.
There are many reasons for the health gains in developing countries.
First, the agricultural and industrial development provides more nutritious food which builds the body of the people in developing countries.
Second, the medical cause has also improved, which helps to protect the people from many diseases.
Third, the people of developing countries have been aware of the importance of physical training and more and more of them become active in it.
There are also many other reasons accounting for health gains.
With the development of developing countries the healthy [wd2,-1] condition will improve more rapidly.
Great changes have taken place in the developing countries since the second world war.
One of the changes is that the life expectancy has increased and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased.
A liable data shows that the life expectancy has increased by 20 years from 1960's [np4,3-2] to 1990's and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased from 200 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births in the latest [wd3,s-] forty years.
The reasons about the changes are that the developing country's economy has greatly increased since 1960's [np4,s-] .
The standard of living has increased.
morever [fm1,-] , the medical thcnology [fm1,-] has greatly developed.
Thus the life expactancy [fm1,-] has increased and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has increased from 1960's [np4,-2] to 1990's in the developing countries.
According to the chart, Health [fm3,1-] gains in developing countries have achieved prominent progress in the past 30 years.
One can see that life expectancy has increased from 40 to 80 since 1960 to 1990, in the [wd5,1-1] meanwhile the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased from 200 %0 to 100%0.
It's an excellent performance [np1,s-] that both the life expectancy and the infant mortality have changed [cc3,-2] two times in the 30 years.
What caused [vp1,-2] this happen?
Firstly, people's living standard in developing countries had improved a lot, as the result of that people pay more attention to their health.
What's more, people have more money to buy nutrious [fm1,-] food to restort [fm1,-] to keep their body healthy and strong.
Secondly, the government cares [vp1,-4] more for the people than before.
Mordern [fm1,-] hospitals have founded [vp7,3-] and good doctors and nurses are afforded [wd3,s-] .
Thirdly and the most important of all, the technology are [vp3,2-] so advanced that many deseases [fm1,-] that can't [vp6,s-] be cured are able to be cured now.
From the bouyant [cc4,-1] progress, we can expect there'll be a further progress in health gains in the future.
Namely, the life expectancy has a good further [wd7,s-] of rising while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] will be increasing [wd7,s-] decreased.
In recent decades, life expectancy and infant mortality have great [wd2,1-1] changed in developing countries.
Life expectancy has great [wd2,1-1] increased, on the contrary, infant mortality has great [wd2,1-1] decreased.
For instance, life expectancy was forty years old in 1960, nevertheless, was sixty years old in 1990, its range was from fifty to sixty.
It has increased [cc3,-5] one-third of the primitive figure.
Infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960, but, [wd4,s-] was 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
Its range was from 200 to 100.
It has decreased in half [wd7,1-] .
They were caused by several reasons.
First, economy increased [cc2,1-] in developing countries.
It caused the improvement of the level [wd3,-2] of life and the change of the structure of food.
Second, medical career [wd3,s-] make [vp3,2-] great progress and so forth.
In short, mainly [ad1,s-] , economy caused the change of the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
The above chart is about the changes of life expectancy and infant mortality, which happened in developing countries.
From it we can learn that health gains in developing countries are very great.
On the part of life expectancy, we can see, In [fm3,-] 1960, the life expectancy [wd4,s-] 40 years old.
In 1990, it reached 60 years old, with the [np7,1-5] increase of 20 years old.
On the part of infant mortaility [fm1,-] , the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
In 1990, it reduced to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why did the changes take place?
I think the reason is as following [wd2,3-] : First, the living standard of the people increased [wd3,s-] , people had enough food to eat and comfort places to live in.
They no longer suffered from coldness and starvation.
Second, the medical care was better than before.
When people got ill, they would get the best care or treatment.
Third, owing to the development of medicine, more and more diseases could be overcome.
So we can see, the health gains in developing countries is [vp3,6-] very exciting and may get better.
Healthy [cc4,-1] conditions have developed in developing countries.
Many aspects of the healthy [cc4,-1] conditions change, for example, It has stated that through [wd3,s-] the statistics [ad1,s-] : Life expectancy has changed from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
Infant mortality decreased sharply.
In 1960, there have [wd3,s-] 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but only have [wd5,s-] 100 deaths in 1990.
Therefore, the world economic [wd2,2-1] increased very fast from 1960 to 1990, the conditions of our life are also developed.
More and more technology of medicine are applied to [wd4,s-] , thus brought [vp6,s-] about a good condition for people.
Another reason of health gaining is the food and the labour, many people relived [wd3,s-] from the hungry and the burdon [fm1,-] of hard work.
In a word, good health and good heathy [fm1,-] conditions are gained in developing countries.
More and more people live in [wd5,1-3] a good life.
Compared the positive [wd7,s-] with the past, heath has gained in developing countries.
For example, in developing countries, the life expectancy in 1960 was about 40 years old, yet in 1990 it has increased to 80 years old.
 [wd4,-2] Another example, the infant mortality has decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to about 100 in 1990.
All is showing a fact that heath [fm1,s-] gains in developing countries.
What has caused the changes?
We are now living in peace and most of the developing countries have ceased fire and switched to developing economicy [fm1,-] .
Secondly, the living conditions have impoved [fm1,-] against [wd3,s-] the past.
Now most people of these countries can get enough food to eat and even live comfortably.
After World War II, ??
?peace and development?????
became the topic [wd4,s-] .
Every country is tring [fm1,-] its best to develop.
Escpecially [fm1,-] , the devolping [fm1,-] countries have made great progresses.
Have a sight [wd3,s-] on the people's health in the developing countries, we can see it [pr1,s-] .
The life expectancy was about 40 years old in 1960, thirty years later, it increased to about 60 years old.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] was decreased [vp7,s-] from the 20 persent [fm1,-] in 1960 to 10 persent [fm1,-] in 1990.
Two group [np3,1-] [np4,s-] simple numbers gave us the information of the improvement.
The cause to this progress [wd4,s-] mainly because [wd4,s-] the devolpment [fm1,-] of economy.
With more money and more commodity [np3,2-] , people have better food, clothing, medical care.
Better living condition makes people more healthy, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] can be decreased [vp7,s-] , the life expectancy can be increased.
Another reason is more and more people are geting [fm1,-] good education, more and more medical commonsense [cc4,1-] were [vp3,3-] known by people.
People began to know how to develop good habits and prevent themselves from diseases.
In [pp2,-3] according to the chart, from 1960 [wd4,s-] -- 1990, the life expectancy in developing countries has been keeping rising while the infant mortality has been keeping declining in those countries.
In 1960, the life expectancy is only 40 years old, but in 1990, It has risen to 60 years old, on the contrary, the infant mortality has declined from 25%0 to 100%0.
Why does this happen.
It is mainly because of the developing economic [wd2,2-] in those countries.
The developing economic [wd2,2-] provids [fm1,-] more financial funds, so the governments can improve the qualities both [wd1,2-5] of the people's living and medicine.
It is certainly [wd2,s-] that the health conditions in developing countries will be greatly improved if their economic [wd2,2-] keeps developing and the governments pay more attention to the people's health condition.
Healthy [cc4,-1] condition in developing countries get [vp3,5-] dramatic improvement in recent years.
We can see the development from the above gramphs [fm1,-] .
For example, in developing countries the life expectancy is forty years in 1960 but is sixty years in 1990.
Another example is the infant mortaility [fm1,-] , in 1960 the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
Why is the development?
the primary reason is the development of economic [wd2,3-] .
In recent years, most of [wd4,1-2] developing countries have succeeded in developing economic [wd2,2-] so they have much money to improve the condition of health and the standard of people's living.
At the same time, informations [np5,-] difuses [fm1,-] more and more quickly.
people [fm3,-] in the developing countries can get more information about health.
In a word, with the society developing, the developing countries will gain much more improvement of health.
In recent years the health gains in developing countries have dramatically improved.
For example, the life expectancy in these countries in 1960 was 40, and it was 60 in 1990.
And the infant mortaility [fm1,-] also decreased.
In 1960, about 200 out of 1000 infants died when they were born, in 1990, the figure is 100 out of 1000.
Why have these changes taken place?
First, with the development of their economy, people's living conditions have improved greatly.
They have paid much more attention and money for [wd3,s-] their health.
Second, the government [np3,-3] of those countries have gradually realized the importance of impoving [fm1,-] people's medical condition.
They have spent more and more money on building modernized hospitals and clinics so that people can receive better treatment when they are ill.
But there is still a great instance [wd7,s-] between developing and developed countries.
So we students should study hard to make more contribution for [wd3,3-2] our country.
The stardard [fm1,-] of economy isn't lower in developing countries than in developed countries.
In what situation does the populace remain [vp1,-3] the [wd5,-2] these countries.
Lets look over [wd3,s-] the figures of the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
The average life expectancy in 1960 was only 40 years old, but till [wd3,s-] 1990, the life expectancy added [wd3,s-] up to 60 years old.
At the same time, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] had been reducing.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but till [wd3,s-] 1990, the infant mortality was reducing [vp1,-2] 10 percent.
The increasing [wd2,-2] of life expectancy and the reducing of infant mortaility [fm1,-] , there was [vp3,1-2] many reasons.
Firstly, the economy in these countries had been developing and the living [wd4,s-] of people had been improving.
The nations carried out many methods, for example, they strengthened the medicine equipment and advanced [cc3,-3] some good measures, we believed [vp6,-s-] there was a great development in the future.
In most developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality are different at different times.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy is about 40 and the infant mortality is nearly 20%.
However, in 1990, the things are changed: the life expectancy increased, but the infant mortality decreased.
The life expectancy reaches [vp1,-2] to 60 and the infant mortality lowers to [wd3,1-1] 10%.
The reasons of these change [np3,1-] are varies [wd2,1-] from country to country.
But there is something in common.
First, with the development of science, the people's living standard is increasing.
The days when they have to fill their stomachs with anything available are gone.
People have more money to better their living conditions.
Second, people's health [cc2,1-2] is confirmed by the advanced medical equipments [np5,-] .
Third, many new foods which can benefit people's body are invented.
With the development of the science and technologe [fm1,-] , people's living condition is certain to get better and better.
In developing countries the life spon [fm1,-] and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] had been greatly changed in recent thirty years.
The life spon [fm1,-] had been raised; in 1960, the life spon [fm1,-] was forty years, about half of the life expectancy, but to [wd3,2-1] 1990, it improved [vp1,-4] to sixty years old, about one point five times of [wd4,s-] 1960.
At the same time, the infant mortality was lowered, in 1990, there were one hundred infants died in every 1000 births, but in 1960, it arrived at [wd3,s-] 200 deaths per 1000 births, in spite of this, this all lowered the average [wd7,s-] .
What caused this [pr3,-1] changes ?
Perhaps this: with the development of the society, people's living condition is improved highly, the medical treatment is improved rapidly.
More and more people pay attention to their health.
They have enough time and money to adjust their diet, the arrangement of nutrition is reasonable.
Further more [fm2,1-] , they do exercies [fm1,-] to make themselves health [wd2,2-] .
Because of the lelvel [fm1,-] [wd4,s-] their knowledge about infant increased, they looked after their baby more scientific [wd2,5-] .
Although [wd3,s-] this, the life spon [fm1,-] still lowers [wd3,s-] the life expectancy, We still needs [vp3,2-] to pay attention to the problem of our health.
Do our best to low down [wd3,s-] the infant mortality.
According to the chart, we can see that in developing countries, the life expectancy and the infant mortality have changed from 1960 to 1990.
The life expectancy has increased from 40 years old to 60 years old while the infant mortality has decreased from 200 to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why has the condition [wd3,s-] changed so greatly?
I think there are two reasons for that.
Firstly, with the development of social economy, people's life has improved, the structure of food has been more reasonable and the equipments [np5,-] of medicine has exchanged too.
Secondly, people pay more attention to the enegy [fm1,-] and their health, they do more exercises to improve it.
With the development of industry and agriculture, I believe the life expectancy [cc2,2-3] will be older, 100-year-old person will be not a story, and whatmore [fm2,-] , more and more older person [np3,4-] will appears [vp9,1-] .
From the chart, we can easy [wd2,1-2] find out two trends about the healthy [cc4,-1] condition in developing countries.
One is that the life expectancy is geting [fm1,-] long [aj3,s-] [wd3,s-] , the other is that the infant mortality is down [wd3,s-] .
From 1960 to 1990, [wd5,s-] in 1960, life expectancy was 40 years old, [wd4,s-] infant mortality was 200 per 1,000 births, but in 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years old, [wd4,s-] the infant mortality reduced to 100.
What causes this change?
I think there are two important reasons.
One is that the living level in the developing countries is rising.
People can spend much money on food, living conditions, the other reason is that the governments have take [vp9,1-] some measures to better the people's health, every year they'll take out much money to set up hospitals and train many medical persons.
I think, with the development of the word [wd3,s-] , more and more people will live long [aj3,s-] .
From the illustration, we can see the facts: from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy rised [fm1,-] from 40 years old to 60, and the life expectancy increased by 50%.
And the infant mortality decended [fm1,-] from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100, and the infant mortality decreased by 50%.
This is a dramatical [fm2,-] change in developing country [np6,s-] .
Why did the change take place [cc5,1-1] dramatically?
In the developing country [np6,s-] , with the increasing [wd2,-2] of the level-life [fm2,-] , the individual medical measures [wd3,s-] improved.
The number of hospitals and doctors kept rising, the medical measures improved [cc5,-2] very much.
So the life expectancy rised [fm1,-] and the infant expectancy decended [fm1,-] .
With the development of society, the life expectancy has increased in developing country [np6,s-] .
In 1960s' [np4,s-] , the life expectancy is about 40 years old, and in 1990s' [np4,s-] , it is about 60 years old.
It has increased about 20 years old in thirty years.
At the same time, the infant mortality has decreased.
In 1960s' [np4,s-] , the infant mortality is 200 deaths per 1000 births, and it decreased to about 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990s'.
The reason of the change is that the standard of life [wd3,2-] and the medicine condition has [vp3,s-] been improved.
The technology [cc1,-2] of science has been developed quickly, which contribute [vp3,5-] [vp1,-4] the development of economy.
With the improvement of the medicine condition, the life expectancy has been increased and the infant mortality has declined [wd3,s-] .
Nowadays, people's life is longer than in the past in developing countries.
This can be seen from the instructions [wd3,s-] given in Chinese [wd7,s-] .
In 1960, the life expectancy was only 40 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was as high as 200 per 1,000.
In 1990, the life expectancy was 60 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only 100 per 1,000.
It [wd3,-3] is to say, people's life expectancy became long [aj3,s-] [wd3,s-] and the infant mortality reduced.
What caused the changes?
First, people's living conditions had become better and they could get more food such as meat, milk etc.
Second, people could also get better medical care so that they could survive many diseases.
A study show [vp3,2-] that the life expectancy of developing country [np6,2-] is [vp6,s-] more than 60 years old until [wd3,s-] 1990.
That is to say, it will [vp6,-s-] increase [vp1,-6] 20 years than [wd3,s-] that of 1960, when life expectancy is [vp6,6-] 40 years old.
While the infant mortality in the developing country [np6,s-] in 1996 is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
Until [wd3,s-] 1990, it will [vp6,s-] decrease half [wd4,s-] 1960.
That is 100 deaths of 1000 births.
What courses the great change?
First in the past decade years [wd5,2-] , the level of economic growth have [vp3,5-] rised [fm2,-] rapidly.
People can eat well and can care for their health from [wd3,s-] adding the food of [wd3,3-1] nutritions [np5,-] .
Second, with the development of the technology, the chemically [wd2,1-1] facilities have increased and new medicines have been invented.
In addition, chemical technology is developing quickly.
In conclusion, the rapid development of economy and technology lead [vp3,7-] [vp1,s-] to the life expectancy and infant mortality changed greatly.
Since 1960, in many developing countries there have been great changes in life expectancy and infant mortality.
In 1960 life expectancy was 40 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But in 1990, life expectancy was 60 years old, and infant mortality was 100 deaths per 1000 births in developing countries of [wd3,3-2] the world.
What caused these great changes?
I think there are several reasons as follows.
Firstly.
In [fm3,1-] 1960, because many developing countries gained independence not long ago, they couldn't have money to develop their economy, but after 30 years, with the help of the world the people in these countries make rapid progress.
Not only economy but also everything have developed greatly.
The people's living conditions have improved a lot.
Secondly.
In 1960 some developing countries had [wd3,s-] wars with each other.
At that time they couldn't develop their economy.
But now the world is very peaceful, they can develop their economy, build their countries.
I think with the help of the government [np3,s-] , hard [cc4,-1] people in developing countries will also have a good life.
The illustration showed us that life expectancy in 1960 was fourty [fm1,-] and it became sixty in 1990.
We also knew from the illustration that infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and it became 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
From these changes we realized that life expectancy was raising [wd3,s-] and infant mortality was becoming low [aj3,s-] .
The reason for these changes existed [wd3,s-] in two points.
First, material life [cc2,1-2] was increased in developing countries.
Second, mental life [cc2,1-2] was increased too.
For instance, in many developing countries, people couldn't feed [vp1,-2] for themself [fm2,-] in 1960.
They often had not enough food to eat.
They lived a bad life.
But in 1990, with developing technology, they had enough food.
They lived a happy life.
All these reasons led to the changes.
According to the table [wd3,s-] , the expectancy has increased from 40 years old to 60 years old, on the countrary [fm1,-] the infant mortality is decreased from 20% to 10% in developing countries in the past 30 years.
The following is the reasons that cause the variation.
Firstly, with the development of society, people can get more nutrious [fm1,-] food such as meat, egg and so on to eat.
This helps old people live longer and infants became [vp4,s-] healthier.
Secondly, medical equipments [np5,-] develop quickly in these countries.
When a person feels ill, he can go to a hospital and have a check.
By this means [vp1,2-s-] he can know what illness he gets and be [vp4,s-] cured more quickly than in the past.
As for an infant, before giving birth to it, its mother is checked, when it is born, it was injected.
In this way it can avoid being ill.
The last reason is that people have more time than ever.
In their free time they can do more exercise to keep themselves heathy [fm1,-] .
If a mother is healthy, her baby is probably healthy too.
As creatures, people have their lives, from birth to death.
In different countries, people go to work, and realize their human [cc4,-1] value.
They write their different life travelling [cc2,2-] .
In developing countries, people work hard to make life [wd3,1-] .
Their health is worth worring [fm1,-] .
The life expectancy of developing countries in 1960's [np4,s-] was 40 years old.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] in [wd3,-2] that time [ad1,s-] of developing countries was two hundred deaths per one thouthend [fm1,-] births.
Why?
The important reason was that the food was not enough to [wd3,3-3] so many people in 1960.
And the developed contries [fm1,-] took hold of [cc3,2-3] the world econimic [fm1,-] , that made the [wd5,2-3] most developing countries's [np4,-] people [wd4,s-] in deep trouble.
Now, the developing countries's [np4,-] people stand up.
They by their hand [np3,1-] , by their pains, gain [cc3,-4] their own countries.
They are never to worry about no [wd5,s-] eating!
They also build they [wd2,3-1] industries, developing [vp4,s-] technology.
The people of developing countries are now all healthy, and live a good life.
In the developing countries, the life expectancy is 60 years old, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is one hundred death per one thouthend [fm1,-] births in 1990.
In one word, the people's health is getting good and good [aj3,4-] in developing countries.
The health condition has been developed since 1960, especially in the developing countries.
As is know [vp9,1-] [wd4,s-] above [wd1,s-] the chart given in Chinese , the life expectancy was 40 years old in 1960.
After 30 years, the life expectancy had increased to 60 years old.
On the other hand, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] in the developing countries had decreased very much.
In 1960, it was 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
But in 1990 the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only half [wd4,s-] of 1960's, 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
How the changes took place?
It is important that the agriculture in the developing countries has developed, for it made it possible that more and more wheats [np5,-] and corns produced [vp7,s-] to feed on [wd5,1-2] more people.
Besides, the industrialization in the developing countries could contribute to them [pr1,s-] .
How the health condition of the developing countries are increasing.
we believe that more health gains will be made in the future.
This is a chart about the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
From this chart we can see the variety [wd7,s-] of the life expectancy and of the infant mortality.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy is expected to [wd4,s-] 40 years old while it is sixty years old in 1990.
Similarily [fm1,-] , the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 whears [fm1,-] it is decrease [vp9,1-] by 100 in 1990.
In 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The above fact is brought about by different factors.
For one thing, it is related to the progress of science and to the increase of the people's living standards.
In [wd4,-2] old days, people didn't know how to use some useful things such as man-made product.
Their food is mainly from wild plants and animals.
Nowadays, people not only manufact [fm1,-] synthesis [wd2,1-1] febel [fm1,-] but also refine [wd3,s-] some useful things from wild plants and animals.
Second, this is the result of the body [cc1,-1] quality of the people.
Now, people have some time to exercise and know the importance of good health.
Man is eating animals's [np4,-] food [wd5,s-] such as fish and hens.
They are tend [vp9,1-] to eat the ingredient [wd3,s-] food.
The last thing, with [wd3,-3] the result of man's curing some fatal diseases, this [pr1,s-] mainly caused the decrease of the infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
The life expectancy of people and the infant mortality of [wd3,s-] the developing countries have a very [ad2,-1] changes from 1960 to 1990.
These [pr1,s-] can be known from above table [np6,3-] .
We can study [wd3,s-] that during 1960, the people's life is very short.
The highest life expectancy is 40 years old.
And the infant mortality is also higher [wd3,s-] , which comes to the numbers [np3,-3] of 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
But, in 1990, these situations change [cc5,-1] largely.
The life expectancy of the developing countries become [vp3,s-] longer, 60 years old.
As far as the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is concerned, which breaks [wd3,s-] down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why do the situations happening [vp9,3-] ?
First, the economic development results in the changes.
With the level [wd5,-1] standards advancing, people can get the necessary things for their living.
Second, the medical conditions is [vp3,3-] better than befo [fm1,-] r. So people can prevent themselves from the illness, and staintain [fm1,-] their health.
In short, the advancing environment, as [wd3,s-] the economy, the medicine and other conditions result in the large changes of the life expectancy and the infant mortality of [wd3,s-] the developping [fm1,-] countries from 1960 to 1990.
According to the information from the draft [wd3,s-] , we can easily find that health gains in developing countries.
Firstly the life expectancy in 1960 is 40 years old.
But in 1990 it becomes 60 years old.
Secondly, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is decreasing apparently.
In 1960, there were 250 deaths per 1,000 births.
Thus [wd3,s-] in 1990 the infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduced down [wd5,1-] to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
I think the reasons that cause the great changments [fm1,-] [wd4,s-] as [wd4,s-] following.
First, medical technicals [fm1,-] have developed greatly.
Some illness that couldn't be solved [cc3,5-] in pass [fm1,-] can be cured easily now.
Second, because of the improvement of people's living condition people can often eat meat, milk, eggs etc.
These foods will do good to people's health very much.
Third, world peace makes people work and live freely and comfortably.
All these makes the changements [fm2,-] .
If people in developing countries work more hard [aj3,1-] than befor [fm1,-] our life will be better than now.
In the past years, the life expectancy [cc2,s-] in developing country is very small, and the infant mortality of these country is very high.
For example, in 1960, the life expectancy in developing country is 40 years old.
At the same time, the infant mortality of developing country is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
However, in the year of 1990, the situation have [vp3,2-] had a very large change.
The life expectancy in developing country is 60 years old, which is more [wd1,-3] 20 years than that of 1960.
And the infant mortality have [vp3,4-] decreased to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
All of [wd5,1-1] this show [vp3,3-] a profound change in the life of developing country [np6,s-] .
The reason of the change have [vp3,5-] [cc2,5-1] many.
First, the life [wd3,-1] standard in these countries has obviously improved.
So their healthes [np5,-] are very good [wd1,2-2] in condition.
Second, the development of the medicine [wd2,1-1] service results [vp1,-5] the increase of life expectancy.
As last [wd3,s-] , the world is relatively peaceful, which also is a [np7,-1] important reason of the change.
According to the datas [fm2,-] about the life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries, we can see that it has changed much since 1960.
The life expectancy's range in 1960 was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 20, while in 1990 it was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 60.
The latter was nearly three times compared to the former.
And the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was just [wd4,s-] opposite.
In 1960, its range was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 200, and in 1990 it was 0 [wd5,s-] ~ 100.
So we can see that the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was declined [vp1,4-2] very much.
Why was the things [vp3,3-] like that?
We can understand it from these ways [wd3,s-] .
First, in the past, developing countries hadn't strong economic [wd2,1-] .
People in those countries were suffered [vp7,5-2] from serious disease [np6,s-] .
And in the [wd5,1-2] these days, the developing countries developed fast, so their people have had good life, especially in medicine [wd2,-1] condition.
Secondly, with [pp1,-4] the economic [wd2,1-1] goes better, the politicy [fm1,-] gets satisfactory.
Thus, people are living happily not only in material life but also in spirit [wd2,s-] life.
Thirdly, people have more spare time to live with their children than before.... With [pp2,-2] a word, the health has been payed [fm2,-] more attentions [wd4,s-] than ever.
In developing countries life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] taken [vp9,1-1] place at [wd4,-3] past thirty years.
Life expectancy, in 1960, it [wd5,s-] was 40 years old about [ad1,s-] , however in 1990, it's 60 years old.
Infant mortaility [fm1,-] varied from 2 percent(1960) to 10 percent (1990).
From [wd4,-2] above we can see those two aspects varied [cc5,-1] obovisouly [fm1,-] .
Why this variation taken [vp9,3-1] place?
By [pp2,-4] my view of point, first is the development of economy.
The developing countries are independed [fm2,-] which makes them develop their national economy.
Economy is the base of country [np6,s-] .
Second the government take [vp3,2-] care of people, they take measures to prompt [wd3,s-] people's healthy [wd2,1-] .
for [fm3,1-] example, the state set [vp3,2-] up all kinds of hospital [np3,3-] , this is benifit [fm1,-] to people's remedy.
Third, people's conception varied.
today [fm3,1-] more and more people believe [vp1,-1] science, this will be good for their health.
In short, the variation of life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries showed the progress of the society.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of the world, the life expectancy will be more higher [aj3,1-] and infant mortality more lower [aj3,1-] .
From this chart, we can see that in the developing countries, in 1960, the life expectancy was about forties but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] deaths [wd5,1-] reached more than 200 per 1,000 births.
And in 1990, the life expectancy increased to sixties, on the contray [fm1,-] , the infant mortaility [fm1,-] deaths [wd5,1-] decreased [vp1,-4] about 100 per 1,000 births.
Why the life expectancy gets higher, but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] deaths [wd5,1-] per 1,000 births get lower?
There are three reasons: The first one is that the medical instrurements [fm1,-] is advanced, which can save more babbies [fm1,-] from the deasis [fm1,-] than before.
This one is the main reason.
The second is the society call [vp3,2-] on people to preserve [wd3,s-] infants, and provides some measures.
The third is the human being [np3,s-] give more cautiousness to this question [wd3,s-] .
Certainly there are some other reasons that cause the result.
In one [pp2,1-1] word, the more quickly the country developed the higher the life expectancy and the lower the infant mortaility [fm1,-] death per 1,000 births.
In 1960, people's life expectancy of [wd3,s-] developing countries was forty years old, while in 1990 it was sixty years old.
Through this we can see that the developing countries' people [np4,1-1] life had become longer.
The baby's infant mortality, however, had decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births during [wd3,-3] the same time.
The cause of the changes mainly consists in the economic development of these countries.
The foods became enough, the medician [fm1,-] conditions were greatly developed and people's living conditions were developed also [ad1,s-] with the development of economy.
All these made people's life of [wd3,1-3] developing countries better.
Now with these country 's [np3,1-] development, people's life is becoming longer and the baby's [wd5,-1] infant mortaility [fm1,-] is becoming lower.
It's certain that developing countries' people [np4,1-1] life will be more happier [aj3,1-] in the future.
As can be seen from the table, during the periods from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy is [vp6,s-] increasing from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
However, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is [vp6,s-] decreasing from 200 in 1960 to 100 in 1990, per 1,000 births.
Why did this case [wd3,s-] take place?
First, the medical standard was increasing.
In developing countries, before 1960, the medical ability is poor.
Some medines [fm1,-] could not be got.
With the development of civillization [fm1,-] , the medical standard is developing.
Second, the living standard was increasing in developing countries.
Before 1960, people could not find enough things to eat.
The [wd5,-1] both can be seen from the development of China.
When I was young, my family was poor, but now days [fm2,1-] , my family is changing much.
We have enough money to improve our living standard and go to see the doctor.
According to the chart given by the compersition [fm1,-] it is obviously [wd2,s-] that from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy is rising rapidly and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is reliving [wd3,s-] quickly in the developping [fm1,-] countries.
Why does this tread [fm1,-] come out then?
We say that it is because of the development of science in developing countries, people do [cc3,-2] any ways to increase their living level, for example, in our country, people do their best to develop agriculture, and do some experiments to increase the level of technology.
So people don't have to worry about [wd4,3-3] nothing to eat.
The second reason is that the medical level is increased too, many illness that could not be cured before can be treated well now.
Many people in [pp2,-2] our ages know that we should eat clean food, not to [wd5,s-] eat food we don't [vp6,-2] eat before.
People also know [cc3,-2] some knowledge of medical [wd2,2-] , so they can apply them [pr3,7-] in their everyday lifes [fm2,-] .
In a word, it is the development of science that make [vp3,7-] [vp1,-7] the trend in the chart appeared [vp4,-] -- the life expectancy rising and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] going down.
There is a great change in developing country [np6,s-] about life expectancy.
In 1960, the life expectancy is forty.
But in 1990, it increased to sixty.
In [pp2,-3] the same [wd4,s-] the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is changed.
There was [vp3,1-3] 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
Although in 1990, it cuts down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What are the reasons for these changes?
Firstly, the economic development is the most important reason.
From 1960 to 1990 the developing country [np3,s-] have a rapidly [wd2,-1] development in their economic [wd2,2-] .
Secondly, the developing economic [wd2,2-] impacts the development of the science.
In particully [fm1,-] in the medicial [fm1,-] .
The modern medicial [fm1,-] technology deduces [wd3,s-] the infant mortality.
Thirdly the excellent social conditions is a reason.
The old people gained a good care of [wd5,s-] .
The reasons are not only what I refered [fm2,-] to above.
But I think [vp1,-4] them as the important reasons for the changs [fm1,-] of the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
In developing country [np6,s-] , people commonly have a longer life than ever.
The statistic data above can show the change to you.
In 1960, the life expectancy of the developing country [np6,s-] is 40 years old.
While in 1990, it is about 60 years old.
But contrary [pp2,-2] to that, the infant mortality decreases when it compares with 1960's.
In 1960 the infant mortality is 200 deaths per 1,000 births, while in 1990, it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Perhaps you may ask what's the reason.
In my opinion, it is largely due to the development of economic [wd2,2-] in developing country [np6,2-] .
The standards of life are improving.
People have a strong body.
In addition, with the development of economic [wd2,2-] , the medical conditions are improving accordingly.
More and more hospitals are being put up.
What's more, they began to own modern medical facilities, whenever a child or adult gets sick, he will receive an immediate attention.
I think it is the reason.
In developing countries, the life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] had changed a lot during the past thirty years from 1960 to 1990.
As for life expectancy, in 1960 it was forty years old.
It increased sixty years old till [wd3,s-] 1990.
On the contrary, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 and decreased 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why did it occur [vp1,3-2] this situation?
First, I thought that the standard of living had improved [cc5,-2] very much.
In 1960, human being [np3,s-] depended on the corn, less vegetable and eggs.
However, in 1990, they lived on milk, eggs, more vegetable and fruits and so on.
Second, it is the good medicine and conditions in hospital.
In 1960, the woman usually had baby at home where there is no doctor or nurse.
They could only depend on themselves.
Till [wd3,s-] 1990, they would go to hospital before they had baby [np6,1-] .
The woman would be treated by doctors and nurses, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was only half that in 1960.
Besides these two reasons above, there was [vp3,1-2] other reasons.
From the graph it can be seen that life expectancy has a [np7,-2] upward trend from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, life expectance was 40 years old while in 1990, it reached 60 years old.
Comparing [vp5,-6] with life expectance, Infant [fm3,-] mortality is just the [wd4,s-] way round, it has a downward trend between 1960 and 1990.
In 1960, Infant [fm3,-] mortality was 200 deaths per 100 births, while in 1990, it decreased [vp1,-2] a half.
Such eminent [cc4,-1] changes [wd4,s-] mainly because of two aspects [wd3,s-] .
One is the increasing [wd3,s-] of living condition, it makes people healthy.
The other is the progressing [wd2,-3] of medical service.
Of couse [fm1,-] , there are still other causes effected [vp5,5-2] such changes.
Life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] can indicate the development of a country.
In [wd4,-1] 1960's [np4,2-] , it's soon [wd3,s-] after liberation from [wd4,s-] domination of imperialist countries, many developed countries are [vp6,s-] starting to develope [fm1,-] their industry and economic [wd2,3-] .
At that time, people lived in poor condition and hadn't enough facilities to improve people [np4,-1] life.
Many people died of desease [fm1,-] .
The infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1000 births and average life expectancy is only forty.
Through thirty years' development, many countries have changed it [pr1,s-] .
Their economic [wd2,1-] develops fast, their people's life has improved high [wd2,2-] .
Many people needn't worry about their foods and clothes.
The development has raised life expectancy too.
in [fm3,-] 1990, the expectancy raised [vp1,-2] to sixty and infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined [wd3,-] to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
This [pr1,s-] is what we expect most.
For the graph we can see the change of life expectancy and infant mortality of developing countries.
The life expectancy in 1960 is [vp6,5-2] 40 years and in 1990 increased to 60 years old.
The infant mortality in 1960 is 250%00 and decreased to 100 %00 of [wd3,s-] 1990.
The change is encouraging.
The reasons of the change lie in three main aspects.
Firstly: from 1960s, more developing countries were liberated, there was no cruel rule .
Secondly, the countries economic [wd2,3-] developed in the 30 years.
Nutritions [np5,-] can be got.
Thirdly, The [fm3,-] medical level developed, people have enough money to build their hospitals and other constructions .Many kinds of deseases [fm1,-] can be cured.
Because of the mationed [fm1,-] reasons, health gains in developing countries.
Many changes have taken place in the world including the human's [wd4,s-] span.
It's not very distinctive in developed countries, but in the developing countries, it is quite different.
According to the investigation, the life expectancy in developing countries is 60 in 1990 insteading [fm2,-] of 40 in 1960.
Meanwhile, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] of per 1,000 births is 100 in 1990 insteading [fm2,-] of 200 in 1960.
The reason that causes the huge exchanges [wd3,s-] lies in three points.
First, there is a fatastic [fm1,-] spurt of the productivity in many developing countries during these 30 years.
Since many countries carry out the economic reforms, the people's living standards are higher and higher.
Secondly, the governments have paid more attention to the people's security, working conditions and nutritious [cc4,-1] protection, etc.
Thirdly, the developed countries are now declining [vp1,-2] the gains from the developing ones in trades.
This makes [vp1,-8] the latter can develop more freely than before.
In the past thirty years, the life expectancy and the infant mortality in developing countries have changed much.
The life expectancy has increase [vp9,1-] from 40 years old to 60 years old while the infant mortality declined from 200 to 100 in 1000 births.
From this change, we can draw a conclude [wd2,1-] that health gains in developing countries.
The changes in life expectancy and infant mortality lies [vp3,8-] in some reasons.
First, in the 1960's, most developing countries had gained the victory of revolution, with the victory, they developed their technology, which effected the medicine, so the infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined and the people's life expectancy increased .
Secondly, people have more money to develop [wd3,-2] their diet.
They could have more high quality food, such as meat, eggs, milk, fish etc.
which strengthened their bodies and made them with hold [fm2,1-] the diseases.
For [wd5,s-] the third people take more care of their bodies.
They take [cc3,-2] more exercises than ever.
For these reasons, people in developing countries have gained health in the past thirty year [np3,1-] .
With the developing [wd2,-2] of technology, people's life will be much longer in the future.
The life expectancy in the developing countries rises from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990, while the infant mortality reduces from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 in 1990.
It's well-known that, today the developing countries develop rapidly, not only the development of industry, agriculture but also medical cases [wd3,s-] , trace [wd7,-1] cases [wd3,s-] , etc.
The society is becoming rich, and many [np8,-4] advanced healthy [cc4,-1] equipment are [vp3,1-] set up.
People also have more money to improve their live [wd2,-1] standard.
They pay more attention to live [vp5,4-] better and better.
They begin to pay attention to nutrition, health, etc.
With the improvement of live [wd2,-1] standard and medical [wd2,3-] , healthy cases [wd3,1-] , the life expectancy rises.
Meanwhile, people think babies are more [aj3,s-] important.
They do their best to feed their babies well, to bring up them [wd1,3-] well.
The problem of feeding babies becomes important to poor young parents.
With the development of the developing countries, we are sure that the health can gain [cc5,-3] more and more.
From the information that has been affored [fm1,-] .
We can see the great changes of the life expectancy and the infant mortality in developing countries.
We can see that the life expectancy has increased from forty years old in 1960 to sixty years old in 1990, and the infant mortality has reduced from twenty persent [fm1,-] in 1960 to ten persent [fm1,-] in 1990.
This dedicates [wd3,s-] the health gains in developing countries.
There is much [np8,-s] reason, about these changes.
First, from 1960, there was few world war [np3,2-] breaking out.
People lived a more peaceful life than at [pp2,-2] the past.
The number of the victim [np3,4-] in the war had reduced greatly.
Second, the developing countries had paid more attention to the economic [wd2,1-] .
the [fm3,-] people's living condition [cc2,1-1] increased year by year.
The health are [vp3,1-] getting better too.
The third reason is the medical condition got better and better.
The number of which [wd4,1-1] [pr5,1-1] died of disease got smaller and smaller.
Most [wd4,s-] of all is the states paying more attention to the health of the persons [wd3,s-] in their countries.
From the chart, we drew a conclusion that the life expectancy increased rapidly and the infant mortality discreased [fm1,-] sharply from 1960 to 1990, in the developing countries.
This thing [wd3,s-] consisted [wd3,s-] in various aspect [np3,1-] of the society.
First, the steady development of society is the main reason.
In this atmosphere, old people can take care of himself [pr3,6-] and adult people have enough time to look after their infants.
Second, with the medical development, the illness of old people can be controlled and the infant can be taken care of, many other aspect [np3,2-1] all can result in it [pr1,s-] .
In 1990, the living standard of people, raise [vp1,s-] all over the developing countries, the life expectancy of old [wd4,4-] rise and infant mortality [wd4,s-] down.
In short with the development of society people will be alive longer and infant mortality will be down.
In the latter [wd4,1-3] of this century, great changes have taken place in life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
A case in point is china [fm3,-] .
In terms of [wd3,2-2] the chart, on [pp2,-2] one hand, life expectancy in 1960 was 40 years old, and it had increased to 60 years old in 1990, on the other hand, infant mortality in 1960 was 200 deaths per 1,000 births, and it had decreased to 100 in 1990.
I think there are two cardinal [cc4,-1] reasons about it.
First, medical technology improved, thus more wholesome [cc4,-1] babies are brought to the world .
Second, life conditions are better and better, people could pay more attention to the nutrition to [wd3,1-2] their diet.
According to the instructions [wd3,s-] , we can see that the life expectancy in developing countries increased markedly.
In China, the life expectancy was roared [wd7,s-] from 40 years old in 1960 to 80 years old in 1990.
At the same time the infant mortaility [fm1,-] decreased from 200 to 100(deaths per 1000 births).
Why the changes were [wd1,s-] so large [cc4,4-] in 30 years and what lead [vp3,1-3] to these changes?
At [wd5,s-] first, in that 30 years, most developing countries focus their attentions on the economic construction and they have gained great success.
The people's living standard has been increased, and the health conditions also become better.
Secondly, many international organizations offered developing countries great help.
That also make [vp3,2-] [vp1,s-] the life expected [wd2,1-1] increased and the infant mortality decreased.
The developing countries' life expectancy and infant mortality have appeared a great changment [fm2,-] from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old while in 1990 it adds to 60 years old, the reason for this changment [fm2,-] is mainly about [wd3,s-] the increasing [wd2,-] of life level, people are no longer hungery [fm1,-] .
They primally [fm1,-] live a happy and healthy life, so these cause the rise of life expectancy.
Besides the increasing rat [wd3,s-] of life expectancy, The [fm3,-] infant mortaility [fm1,-] has decreased from 1960 to 1990.
About 250 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960. it's [fm3,-] a very high number.
But in 1990, It's [fm3,-] down to 100 deaths per 1,000 births, the mainly [wd2,-1] reason of this rangs [fm1,-] is that the people's healthy [cc4,-1] condition has improved with the developing [wd2,-2] of medical [wd2,1-] .
People have controled [fm2,-] many influencing [cc4,-1] diseases and the quality of food and drink has been increased.
People's healthy [cc4,-1] condition is better than before.
With the developing countries [np4,-1] independence and development.
We believe that the life expectancy will [wd4,-2] more high [aj3,1-] , on the other hand, infant mortaility [fm1,-] will [wd4,-2] more low [aj3,1-] .
The above table indicated that life expectancy increased and infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduced in developing countries.
In 1960, the life expectancy in developing countries was 40 years old, but in 1990, the life expectancy had increased by 50 percent, being 80 years old.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 and 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
The reason that resulted in the changes were [vp3,s-] chiefly the development of the science.
First, the development of the science resulted in improving the standard of life, which make [vp3,s-] people have enough food to eat, not worry about living, and lead a happy life.
Second, the development of science lead [vp3,4-] to the applications of technology in all kinds of field [np3,3-] .
The health service improved.
People can get insurance of life, what's more the development of medicine made the infant mortaility [fm1,-] lower than before.
Based on above reasons, life expectancy increased and infant mortality reduced from 1960 to 1990.
With the development of science, this tendency will continue.
According to invastigation [fm1,-] , the life expectancy in advancing [wd3,1-1] countries is 40 years old in 1960; But it is 60 years old in 1990.
So it has a great increase.
Infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960, but it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
So we can see it has a great decrease.
There are three reasons why so great change has happened.
First, the life condition is much better than before, the mortality [wd4,s-] of hungry [wd2,2-] is very small.
Second, the condition of medicine is much better.
When a man or infant is ill, he or she can get good treaty [wd3,s-] .
Third, now more and more people are making [wd3,s-] exercise.
This strengthen [vp3,1-] their bodies and avoid many diseas [fm1,-] .
I believe there will be greater change in [pp2,-1] future.
From the graph we can know [vp1,-4] about the life expectancy and infant mortality have a great change from 1960 to 1990 in the developing countries.
First, life expectancy has increased.
In 1960, it was only 40 years old that people could live.
Otherwise [wd3,s-] in 1990, people could live [wd4,-1] average [np1,-3] 60 years old.
At the same time, Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] has declined.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but it was only the half rate [wd5,s-] of 1960's when it came to 1990.
From that all [wd1,2-] , it show [vp3,1-] [vp1,-4] us a pleasure [wd2,-1] progress on health in developing countries.
What cause [vp3,1-] those great change [np3,2-] on earth?
There are many reasons.
The main reason is the development of their economy, thuse [fm1,-] lead to the development of the medicine.
So great changes appear in the developing countries.
A great change on [wd3,3-1] health has happened in these years in developing countries.
There are some fingers [wd3,s-] about the life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
In 1960, the life expectancy was 40 years old, and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was two hundreds deaths per 1,000 births.
While in 1990, it is reported that the life expectancy was sixty years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What's the reason that caused this change?
The under [wd3,s-] maybe [wd4,s-] the answer.
First, with the living condition get [vp4,4-1] better, people are fond of their life [np3,s-] .
Second, the level of medical [wd2,1-] was rose [vp9,1-] .
People needn't worry about the small disease no [wd3,s-] longer.
All of those reason [np3,1-] made the health gains in developing countries possible.
The health gains in developing countries is [vp3,6-] gradually changed.
According to the instruction given in Chinese [wd3,4-] .
We can learn about sth [fm2,-] .
The life expectancy increased from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy in Chinese [wd2,1-] was 40 years old.
But in 1990, [wd4,s-] increased to 60 years old.
At the same time, the infant mortality declined.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But when it was in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] declined to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The reason why the health gains changed so much because the living standard increased and the government paid more attention to people's health.
More and more people realize that healthy [wd2,1-] is important to a person, they did a lot to improve their constitution [wd3,s-] , [wd4,s-] build up their healthy [wd2,2-] .
Great changes of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries have taken place in the last 30 years from 1960 to 1990.
Life expectancy had changed from 40 years old to 80 years old.
And the infant mortality had fallen from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
This [wd3,s-] is a great accomplishment for human beings to make such a great progress in no less than half an [np7,-1] century.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of the world economic [wd2,2-] , science and technology, people become rich and care more about his [pr3,6-] life and the future of his [pr3,s-] descendants.
Of course, there was no war like World War I and II, the peaceful environment give [vp3,3-] more vigor to the developing [wd2,-2] of human beings [wd3,s-] in developing countries .Thus, the life expectancy rise to a high level and the infant mortality fall to a new [wd3,s-] level.
Health gains in developing countries have great changes.
From the above graph we can see that the life expectancy of developing countries has risen from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has reduced from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The reason that there are such changes is that in the old days developing countries had brutal wars and was poverty [wd2,1-] , the people had not enough food and clothes .
However, nowadays, developing countries have been developing at high speed.
The industry and agriculture also have enough products for the people to consume.
Further more [fm2,1-] , the countries take on a peaceful look.
Therefore, as a developing country, our country should accelerate development so that our lives can be improved quickly.
From the gram [wd3,s-] , we can draw a conclusion that the life expectancy is cresing [fm1,-] and infant mortality is decreasing in developing countries in the world.
During the thirty years from 1960 till [wd3,3-1] 1990, the life expectancy rised [fm2,-] from 40 to 60 years old.
But, in the same thirty years, the infant mortality descended from 200 deaths per 1,000 births to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why did these changes took [vp9,3-] place?
There were such reasons.
First, the developing contries' [fm1,-] economy made a rapid progress.
This provided [vp1,-5] the enough production [wd2,4-] to the people to meet their needs.
Second, the qualities of the developing contries' [fm1,-] people also be [vp4,1-1] raised.
Many fatal dieases [fm1,-] transferted [fm1,-] among people was elimated [fm1,-] .
Third, the development of medicine can cure many incurable diseases in [wd4,-2] old days.
The health gains in developing contries [fm1,-] show the level of life rised [fm2,-] much.
From the data we could find some changes about the life expectancy and infant mortality of developing countries.
First, the life expectancy of developing [wd4,s-] is 40 years old in 1960.
But it has increased to 60 by 1990.
Secondly, the infant mortality of developing countries is 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960.
But is has decreased to 100 by 1990.
You see, the changes [cc2,-3] is [vp3,2-] so much.
I think there are some reasons of the changes.
At [wd5,s-] first, the economy of the developing country is the main reason.
With the improving [wd2,s-] of the developing countries people's living standard, the changes is [vp3,2-] expected.
Then, the peace of the world is also an important reasons [np3,2-] .
In a word, health gains in developing countries has [vp3,5-] made a great progress.
In 1960, the longest [wd5,s-] life expectancy of developing country [np6,s-] is no more than 40 years old and at that moment [wd3,s-] infant mortality is high.
It is estimited [fm1,-] that the total death rate of infant is 25%.
Life time [wd3,1-] is short and the death rate is comparely [fm2,-] high.
People realized its seriousness.
So many methods are adoped [fm1,-] to solve the problem.
They set up many public medical utilies [fm1,-] and called on people to pay attention to their physical exercise and keep bodies healthy by medium.
Such as TV, radio program.
They achieved great improvement.
In 1990 the longest lifetime [wd3,2-] reached 80 years old and the infant mortality dropped by 15%.
In the past thirty years.
Mankind's life in developing country [np6,s-] has been expanded [wd3,s-] with their own attempts [wd3,s-] .
With the development of their society people realized [vp1,-4] how important to keep their own body healthy and the whole country's health gains equally.
From the draft [wd3,s-] we can see, in developing countries, life expectancy and infant mortality in 1990 are very different from those in 1960.
Life expectancy in 1990 is higher than that in 1960.
In 1960 the life expectancy is 40 years old but in 1990 it is 80 years old.
Differing from life expectancy, infant mortality in 1960 is higher than that in 1990.
In 1990 it is 100 deaths per 1,000 births, but in 1960 it is higher.
The reasons for the result are various, for example, the medical level's increasing [wd2,2-] and the economics' [wd2,-] developing [wd2,2-] are all essential [wd3,s-] .
Of all reasons, I think the economics' [wd2,-] developing [wd2,1-] is important, with the developing [wd2,-2] of economics [wd2,3-] , people's expenditure level is higher .
They can eat better and receive much better medical service.
In conclusion, with the developing [wd2,-3] of the society people's life expectancy will be higher and infant mortality will be much lower.
In developing countries, on the average, people's life expectancy averaged 40 years old in 1960, while in 1990 people's life expectancy rapidly increases by 50 years old.
The other issue that attracts our attention to [wd5,7-] is that infant mortaility [fm1,-] is on the decline to ten percent in 1990. against twenty-five percent in 1960.
With time passing, people's life expectancy still [ad1,-1] will prolong [vp1,1-1] and infant mortaility [fm1,-] still [ad1,-1] will be on the decline.
There are some reasons for the changes.
in [fm3,-] [pp2,-3] the one hand, people's physical life [wd2,-1] standard is gradually being raisen [fm2,-] .
With socialty [fm1,-] developing rapidly, in [pp2,-3] the other hand, people change their mind [np6,1-] step by step, because [fm3,s-s-] of it [pr1,s-] people know how to prefect their bodies, and they know how to take care of their infants, and so on .
So we need greatly change people's idea in developing countries, in order to make the people realize that [wd5,1-s-] How [fm3,-] important it is to stay health [wd2,1-] .
From the developing population of China.
In the developing countries, the life expectancy is sharply [cc6,-1] long, and infant mortaility [fm1,-] is decrease [vp9,1-] .
This [wd4,s-] due to the health state is increase [vp9,1-] .
From 1960 to 1990, Chinese life expectancy increase [vp3,1-] [vp6,s-] from 40 to more than 60, but infant mortality decrease [vp3,1-] from 200 to 100 from 1960 to 1990.
What cause [vp3,1-] [vp1,-4] this health state increase?
First of all, living standers [wd3,1-] is improved in developing countries.
Not only did we solve our food question [wd3,s-] , but we attach importance to nutritions [np5,-] : Second, with the living standard improved, our medical stander [wd3,1-] is also improved.
We can cured [vp9,1-] many of [wd5,1-2] deadly diseases, not to saying [wd3,s-] of light illness, another, our spirits is [vp3,2-] higher than before, and this also lead [vp3,2-] to health gains .
By and large, developing countries are developing [vp1,-4] to flourish and strength.
With the development of the science and technology, the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries have a great change.
The life expectancy has increased from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
Meanwhile, the infant mortality has decreased from 200 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 to 100 in 1990.
The reasons in [wd5,1-1] which caused the change are various.
The main reason is the development in medicine and some other sciences and the development of the technology.
And, with the development of the living conditions in the developing countries, they have contained [wd3,s-] more and more chances to overcome [cc3,-3] the infant mortality and to increase the life expectancy.
Today, in the developing countries, the life expectancy is increasing while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is declining.
From the graphs, we can find that, from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy has increased from forty to sixty, and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] has declined from two hundred and fifty deaths per 1,000 births to only 100.
Why has this change taken place?
First, people's level of living has increased.
This makes it possible that people can live well and their heath could be well [ad2,s-] .
Second, people's technologe [fm1,-] of medicine has increase [vp9,1-] .
This makes infant mortality declinedly [fm2,-] .
These changes is [vp3,2-] the reflect [wd2,4-4] of development of our society.
And we believe that more great changes will take place and our lives will be more and more beautiful.
Recently, there are great changes in developing countries, the most [wd4,s-] of those is the change of health, including the life expectancy and infant mortality.
In developing countries, the people live more and more longer [ad3,3-] , but the infant mortality become [vp3,3-] large [wd3,s-] , why does it happen like this ?
The most important [wd4,-3] of [pp1,1-] which [pr1,s-] is the notice [wd7,-] of health.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of medicine [wd2,-1] cause more and more people can live better than before, In 1960 the life expectancy is 40 at [pp2,-2] the average but in 1990, it becomes 60 years old and some can live much older.
However, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is different in 1960, the rate of death was 200 deaths per 1000 births, but in 1990 it was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
The other cause is the policy in such countries.
There are all kinds of causes which to cause the change.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of science and technology, more and more people can live longer, developing countries gain the health of people .
As a developing country, China, its health gains is instructed [wd3,s-] by two pictures -- life expectancy and Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] .
Let's see the first picture: In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old, however, it is 60 years old in 1990 .There is 20 years older than 1960's.
Why?
The first reason -- With the development of the medicine, people's health is improved.
The second, with the level raising of the people's life condation [fm1,-] , people grow stronger and stronger, so they can reject [cc3,-5] some of the bad condations [fm1,-] .
And the third reason, many developing countries(China included), have carried out [cc3,1-2] limited births and so on.
See Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] , in 1960, there are 250 deaths per 1,000 births, and 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
The important reason is that the medicine developed very much.
Another, the life level is improved, and these countries have carried out [cc3,1-2] limited births.
Of course, there are many other reasons to [wd3,2-1] these [pr3,s-] .
Health gains in developing countries have gained the important notion [wd7,s-] of the world.
Now, let us give a back [cc4,-1] look on [wd3,s-] the life expectancy of the developing countries in 1960 and 1990.
In 1960, life expectancy is 40 years old.
In 1990, life expectancy is 60 years old.
During the long 30 years, life expectancy rises by 20 year [np3,2-] .
Infant mortaility [fm1,-] also proves a truth [wd7,s-] .
In 1960, infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 20 percent.
In 1990, it is 10 percent.
From the truth we can draw a conclusion that the developing countries have made rapid progress in man's health.
Now let us find the reasons.
First, also the most important, maybe in recent years, developing countries have gained independence, and have made rapid progress in national industries etc.
These countries can have healthy [cc4,-2] , developed hospitals.
People of the countries are also concentrating on good and healthy food.
Second, in recent years, many countries have formed a lot of birth policy [np3,4-] , and they can get a lot of good things.
Birth control is our country's policy.
From this policy, we have high birth-born [fm2,-] babies [wd7,s-] .
Now, with the development of every country, more and more people will realize the health problem.
From the upper [wd3,-1] chart we can see that the life expectancy is creasing [fm1,-] .
From 1960 to 1990, the Developing [fm3,-] countries [np4,-2] life expectancy is improving from 40 years old to 80 years old.
At the same time, the Infant [fm3,-] mortaility [fm1,-] is decreasing too [wd5,s-] from 1960 to 1900. it's [fm3,-] deaths ratios has decreased from 250 deaths per 1000 births to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Why do life expectancy crease [fm1,-] and infant mortality decrease in the these years in developing countries?
There are two reason [np3,1-] about it.
The first reason is that medical level is improving in developing countries.
People can have a good medical condition.
when people are sick.
A good medical level can bring [vp1,-s-] infant mortality declining and people life extending.
Now, In [fm3,-] developing countries, As [fm3,-] technology developing [vp4,s-] , The [fm3,-] medical level becomes more and more advance [wd2,3-] , which make people live longer.
Another reason is people's life level is improving in developing countries.
After the [wd5,-3] world war [fm3,1-1] II, the developing countries's [fm2,-] life level has great improvement, encnomic [fm1,-] level has high development [cc4,1-] , which make [vp3,s-] [vp1,-s-] people's life expectancy creasing [wd3,5-] and infant mortality decreasing, too.
Here, I will explore [wd3,s-] some cases on the changes of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
First, let us look at the figues [fm1,-] above.
Both of [wd5,1-1] figues [fm1,-] inform us the difference between [wd4,s-] in 1960 and 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy in 40 years old while in 1990, the life expectancy is 60 years old.
The infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1,000 births but in 1990, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Apparently, the life expectancy rises while the infant mortaility [fm1,-] reduces.
It is a good news [np5,2-] .
The reasons of these changes are: First, because of the development of country [np6,s-] , the living conditions are improved.
Second, the medical conditions are improved.
The [wd5,s-] third, the secince [fm1,-] is developed [vp7,3-1] quickly, it make [vp3,1-] many fields develop fast, these fields include medicine, living environment and so on .
All make [vp3,1-] people live longer and make infant die [cc5,-1] smaller.
These make the country develop quickly.
From the chart we can see the following fact.
In 1960, the life expectancy is 40 years old, but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births.
In 1990, the life expectancy is 60 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
From the change we can conclude that the developing countries have maken [fm2,-] great progress over [wd3,s-] the 30 years.
What's the reason?
Since 1960, the developing countries have take [vp9,1-] many measures in economic development, environmental protection.
With the economic development, the medical care is developed too.
At the same time, the stander [wd3,1-3] of the consumer [wd2,4-] is increased.
These are the very reasons.
The developing countries have maken [fm2,-] such progress, [wd4,s-] they can make greater progress in the future.
With the development of the world's economic [wd2,1-] , the conditions of developing countries have made a superous [fm1,-] progression [wd2,2-] .
The life expectancy and the infant mortality are included [wd7,s-] .
In 1960, the condition of the developing countries was poor, as well as that of the world.
The life expectancy of the developing countries was 40 years old on average and the infant mortality was 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
With the development of economic [wd2,2-] , both [wd4,-1] these had made obvious changes.
The life expectancy reached 60 years old in 1990, and the infant mortality reached 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Both the changes were due to the development of economic [wd2,2-] and other relative [wd7,s-] aspects of the society.
The developments of production, medical service and the techniques, all had contributed to the former changes.
And with the development of the society, the conditions will become more precious [wd7,s-] than ever.
Great changes have taken place in developing countries about the life expectancy and the infant mortality.
In 1960, the life expectancy was very low.
Nobody could live over 60 years old.
The life expectancy was 40 years old and or so.
But the infant mortality was very high.
The infant mortality was about 200 deaths per 1,000 births.
However, In [fm3,-] 1990, the life expectancy increased.
The average of the life expectancy was about 60 years old.
And the infant mortality decreased.
It was about no more than 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
Why did it [pr2,s-] take place so many changes.
 [wd1] Because the medical circumstances have developed which ensures the babies [np4,-1] births.
What's more, people have enough money to buy what they want to eat and which [pr5,s-] will be well [ad2,s-] for their health.
So great changes have taken place.
During the past few decades, the health [cc2,s-] of the people of developing countries increased greatly, just as the instruction [wd3,s-] telling [vp4,4-1] us.
On [pp2,-2] one hand, from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy in developing countries has went [vp9,1-] from 40 years up to 60 years.
On the other hand, the infant mortality has decreased by 50 percent within the same period.
In 1960, there were 200 deaths per 1000 births, but only 100 in 1990.
The causes to these changes can [vp9,-1] summarized generally as followed [wd2,1-] .
First, the developing countries have developed [vp1,-6] their economy to a higher level, which according [wd2,s-] increased the living standards of their people.
Second, the medical technology has been greatly went [vp9,4-] up, thus old people could live longer and the infants could grow healthily .
It's [pr2,s-] in [wd5,1-2] no doubt that these changes will certainly maintain.
From the table [wd3,s-] , in developing counties [wd3,2-] , the trend of both the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is obvious.
From 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy had rised [fm2,-] , while the infant mortality had dropped down greatly.
The life expectancy in 1960 was forty year [np3,1-] old.
In the same year, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1000 births, which is very high, in 1990, the life expectancy increased and came to sixties [wd3,-3] years old, twenties [wd3,-1] year more than that of 1960.
Meanwhile, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] diminished by only 100 deaths per 1000 births [wd7,7-] .
Why has these changes taken place in the developing counties.
There are some reasons.
Firstly the governments of the developing counties applied themselves to developing their national economy and produced a lot of food.
Secondly, The [fm3,-] health conditions had been improved greatly.
Thirdly, the life of people were [vp3,4-] better than before, they had enough and nourish food to eat .
There still [ad1,1-2] being [vp4,2-] other reasons contributed to the heathy [fm1,-] gains.
Today, with the development of live [wd2,-1] level in developing countries.
People become more healthy than before in many aspects.
A good point of case is that life expectancy and infant mortality have prominent change in developing countries.
For instance, life expectancy only attained [wd3,s-] 40 in 1960 in China showed in the table.
But in 1990 the situation was changed much, life expectancy has attained [wd3,s-] 60 .
The same as infant mortality in China.
Compared with 200 per 1000 births in 1960 the number of the deaths only was 100 in 1990.
Why happened these changes?
Firstly, developing countries have provided [cc3,-2] some policy [np3,1-] to insure [wd3,2] people's health, they improved people's live [wd2,-1] levels according to [wd3,s-] advancing the productivity.
Secondly, people in developing countries were aware of the importance of health they took exercises and joined [cc3,-2] some sports to make them stronger and stronger .
These affected life expectancy and infant mortality greatly.
I believe life expectancy and infant mortality must change [cc3,-2] to benifit [fm1,-] to people in the future.
Many changes had taken place about life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] in developing countries.
There was a rise about [wd3,2-1] life expectancy.
Life expectancy was 40 years in 1960, while it was 60 years in 1990, while it was 60 years in 1990.
On the other hand, there was a decline about the infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
In 1960, one-fifth infants died of [wd3,s-] 1000 births, while in 1990, one-tenth infants died.
The most important reason which caused these changes was the development of economy in developing countries.
This made people richer, the living conditions of people had improved greatly .
In addition to [wd5,2-2] , Many [fm3,-1] Health organizations had been established so that they protected people from the illness.
We hope that much more progress will be made!
From the chart.
It is showed that the life expectancy has increased steadily from 1960 to 1990, and it is also showed that the infant mortality has decreased so quickly since 1960, so the infant mortality on [pp2,-2] the 1990's is half of it [pr2,s-] , in the 1960's .
There are many reasons for the phenomenon.
First, with the development of the national economy in the developing country, the state provides well-condition [fm2,-1] healthy [wd2,-] facilities.
Second, people's living has improved rapidly since 1960's [np4,-] .
Third, many lows [wd3,s-] have been layed [fm2,-] down to improve the health.
The last [wd3,s-] , medicine has been improved very much.
most [fm3,-] of the deseases [fm1,-] can be cured; only rare cases such as cancer can't be cured.
In a word.
I hope that the people will be better-off [fm2,-] , and the life expectancy become longer and longer, the infant mortality, turn less and less in the developing country [np6,s-] .
Through observation, we can see that the life expectancy in developing countries increased and the infant mortality decreased [cc5,-1] heavily.
The life expectancy in developing countries was forty years old or so in 1960, but it reached sixty years old in 1990.
The infant mortality in developing countries was about two hundred deaths per 1,000 births, however, it decreased to about one hundred deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 .
It is one-second of that of 1960.
The progress of economy and the rising [wd2,-2] of living standard [np6,2-2] of the people accounts [vp3,s-] for the change.
The people in developing countries worked hard to raise their living standard in the past years.
They made great achievements.
They must work harder and their living standard will be better in the future.
From the chart that is shown, we can draw a conclusion that in the period of 1960-1990, there was a distincter [fm1,-] turning [wd3,s-] in both life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
Life expectancy was rising however [wd3,s-] infant mortaility [fm1,-] is belowing [fm2,-] .
In my opion [fm1,-] , there are some reason [np3,1-] for this thing that happened in developing countries.
In 1960, both the economic [wd2,1-] and the tecnology [fm1,-] in these countries are poor, they could not provide enough food and chemical [np6,s-] for their people, so the life expectancy is only 40 years old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 200 deaths per 1000 births .
With the development of the periods [wd7,s-] , these countries have took [vp9,1-] on a new look.
they [fm3,-] have revolutions in science and economic [wd2,3-] .
now [fm3,-] , people have enough money to buy better food and chemical [np6,3-] , and now, their opion [fm1,-] of health is changed.
they [fm3,-] take all sorts of exercise [np3,3-] to develop [cc3,-2] their body.
As we can see the life expectancy is raised almost 60 year old and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] belowed [fm2,-] to 100 deaths per 1000 births.
Nowdays [fm1,-] , health gains in developing countries.
We can see it from two aspects as follow [vp3,1-] .
First, the life expectancy in developing countries has greatly changed, it has risen by twenty years for an average person since 1960 when it was 40 .
Second, the infant mortality has greatly changed also [ad1,s-] , it has declined by half since 1960 in which it was 200/1000 .
Then, what are the reasons of such changes?
One, after the [wd5,-3] world [fm3,-2] war II, nearly all developing countries in the world have switched their attention to develop [vp5,5-2] their economics [wd2,s-] .
First products have been produced.
Then people's life in developing countries is much better than before, as a result people will live longer than before and infant mortality is sure to decline.
Second, most countries in the world call for peace such as China.
The world as a whole is peaceful.
without [fm3,-s] war in developing countries people con't [fm1,-] die during [wd4,-1] prime and the conceived [cc4,-1] women can produce [cc3,-2] their babies well.
So, the result is not strange.
As we can see from the given figure.
Life expectancy is more enlonging [fm2,-] in 1960 than that in 1990, while infant mortaility [fm1,-] has obviously decreased from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, life expectancy at most reaches 40 and in 1990, it reaches sixty.
At the same time, we can know that infant mortaility [fm1,-] in 1960 was high [aj1,-3] to percent 20 [wd1,1-] , however, until 1990, it decreased to percent 10 [wd1,1-] .
What caused the changes in developing countries?
The [wd5,s-] first, I think, is the increase in their people's life standard.
In recent years, the developing countries have made great progress in their economic [wd2,2-] .
So, people have benefited from it and increase their nutrition.
Secondly, medical [wd2,s-] has a rapid development which helps people to live long and make it possible to decline the death of infants.
Thirdly, more and more people begin to believe [vp1,-] science which will be helpful to improve their knowledge of life.
It also can make them know how to protect their bodies [wd3,s-] and to build up their bodies.
With the development of the technology and science in developing countries, the living conditions and living levels of the people are improved greatly.
This effects [vp1,-s-] that the people's life expectancy is high while the infant mortality is low.
As the investigation showing [vp4,3-] , in 1990, life expectancy is 60 years old while in 1960 it was only 40 years old, but the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is 10% in 1990 while 20% in 1960.
Obviously life expectancy is higher than before and infant mortaility [fm1,-] is lower than before.
What lead [vp3,1-] to such affects [wd3,s-] in developing countries?
The first cause is that from 1960 to 1990, the world is peaceful, every countries [np3,1-] are making their effort [np1,-3] into developing products to raise the people's living level.
The second cause is that the morden [fm1,-] medical technologies have improved with the morden [fm1,-] science developing.
The third cause is that there is [vp3,1-2] few war [np3,1-] happened [vp5,s-] in the world .
In a word, during the 30 years, people can live a good living [wd2,2-] and have a good medical [wd4,2-3] for their health.
Great improvement of heath [fm1,-] has been gained in developing countries.
For example, from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy had been raised from 40 to 60 years old, and infant mortality had declined to half of the past [wd7,s-] .
So, less [np8,-1] infants are facing death and people live longer and longer.
The change comes from the two important development [np3,2-] during [pp2,-2] the past, food and medicine.
Now, with the rising level of people's lives, they have more and more money to buy expensive, nutritious food, then become more and more strong .
On the other hand, when they get illness, the development [wd2,1-2] medical method can help them survive it, so less [np8,-1] people face death dangerous [wd2,1-] , and can live loner .
From the chart given above, we can see that there are obvious changes that take place in life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries.
To life expectancy, the average age was 40 years old in 1960, however [wd3,s-] 60 years old in 1990.
While to infant mortality, in 1960, it reached 200 deaths per 1,000 births, but to [wd3,1-1] 1990, it decrease by 50%.
What caused this to happen?
First, with the development of developing countries, people become richer, and More [fm3,-] and more people can afford to see a doctor when they are ill.
Second, Governments pay more attention to people's health.
For example, governments provide [vp1,-4] much money on medicine, setting up special hospitals.
All this leads to health [wd7,s-] of the developing countries.
From the chart, we could find life expectancy increasingly rise and infant morltaility [fm1,-] decline from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, life expectancy only have [vp3,3-] forty years [cc1,-2] of age, but it rose to sixty years [cc1,-2] of age.
While infant mortaility [fm1,-] have [vp3,2-] a great change.
Each per [wd5,1-] 1000 births deaths have 200 persons in 1960 but it increasingly [cc5,-1] decline [vp3,-] 100 persons in 1990.
From [wd4,-2] above facts these changes [cc2,s-] have a lots [np6,1-] of reasons.
The main reason is that these country of ecnormy [fm1,-] has literally [cc5,-1] risen in the lastest [fm2,-] years.
And the condition of medical [wd2,2-] has improved a lot.
More and more people are concerning about their life expectancy and the next generation.
With the level of life improving, people take all the sports and build up their body [np3,1-] .
While people have controled [fm2,-] infant mortality with their efforts from 1960.
All the evidence show [vp3,3-] the health have [vp3,2-] improved in developing countries from 1960 to 1990.
They [pr1,s-] will have a brilliant future in health.
In 1960, the life expectancy of developing countries was only 40 years old.
But thirty years later, it raised [vp1,-1] rapidly, it became 60 years old in 1990 [sn,s-] .
Contrary to the life expectancy, the infant mortality decreased from 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to 100 in 1990.
What on earth causes these changes?
There are two main factors: First, people's life is changed, the food is enough, few people die from hungry [wd2,2-] , and with the increase of food, people become [vp9,-1] pay more attention to the nutrilist [fm1,-] structure of food, which invoied [fm1,-] many diseses .
The other cause is the change of medical condition.
The doctors now can cure many diseases which was [vp3,s-] incurable in the past.
On [wd3,-1] conclude [wd2,1-] , the change of life expectancy and infant mortality is [vp3,s-] connected with the development of economy and technic [fm1,-] .
From above [wd4,1-] , we can see such a fact: In the developing countries, life expectancy was from 0 to [wd5,3-] 40 years in 1960, while in 1990 from 0 to [wd5,3-] 60 years old; The highest infant mortaility [fm1,-] was 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960, but in 1990 it was 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
in [fm3,-] a word, life expectancy was increasing, infant mortality was declined [vp7,s-] .
What causes the changes?
I think that it [pr2,s-] has three reasons: firstly, the people's living level was greatly improved with the development of technology, people can produce more and more highly nuturious [fm1,-] food and pay attention to their diet's structur ; Secondly, medical institutes have been set up in recent years.
it [fm3,-] applies [wd3,s-] people with all sorts of medicine and keep up their health; thirdly, people can take part in all kinds of relaxation.
They makes [vp3,1-] them happy.
Judging [np1,-3] to the graph, it is very easy to know that the life expectancy in the developing country distinctly improved from the [wd5,-3] fourty [fm1,-] years old in 1960 to the [wd5,-3] sixty years old in 1990.
It increased [cc3,-2] 1.5 times from 1960 to 1990.
On the contrary, the infant mortality discreased [fm1,-] two times from the 200 deaths per 1,000 births in 1960 to the 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990.
The reason that causes the transformation [wd3,s-] may lie in three aspects.
Firstly, with the development of the society, the people's life standards increases [vp3,1-] .
So many people can buy good, food such as meat, fish, eggs, chickens.
Secondly, the government pay [vp3,2-] attention to the health of the people, they offer some money to increase [cc3,-2] the conditions for the people's health, for example, they built some hospitals .
Finally, people often take part in some activities, [wd4,s-] playing football, table-tennis and so on.
In a word, the government and people all attach importance to the health.
So it appears [vp1,-3] the above case.
Health in developing countries has been greatly increased from 1960 to 1990.
Life expectancy in developing countries is about 40 years old in 1960 while in 1990 is about 60 years old.
In [pp2,-3] the same time infant mortality has been decreased [vp1,-s-] about 200 deaths per 1,000 births to about 100 deaths per 1000 births.
What caused these changes?
I think they can be due to [wd4,1-2] following facts.
First, most developing countries have been developing their economy.
Their economy has been improved.
So the government had enough money to eastablish [fm1,-] public facillities [fm1,-] , such as hospital, health centre and so on.
Second, people begin to care about their life.
They have enough money to improve their living condition and food quality.
They often took part in sports in their spare time.
The last one, the medical cause has been changed better than ever.
The medical technology is modern.
From these facts we can draw a conclusion that the life expectancy has become longer than ever while the infant mortality has decreased.
With life being bettered, health gains in the world, particularly in developing countries, such as life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] .
In 1960, life expectancy was on the average 40 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] was on the average 200 deaths per 1,000 births while in 1990, life expectancy became on the average 60 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] became on the average 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What caused this change?
First, life conditions were improved greatly.
Food and drink was [vp3,3-] provided [cc5,-1] enough.
House was soluted [fm1,-] .
Second medical conditions were improved too, many illnesses have been cured .
There are a number of hospitals and advanced equipment was set [wd4,s-] .
Third, people have realise [fm1,-] that sports is important.
To build up their health, people have [cc3,-2] a swim, have [wd3,s-] a ball, have a run and so on.
In a word, health gains in developing countries.
As can be seen from the table [wd3,s-] that life expectancy of developing countries has greatly changed.
It rise [vp3,1-] from 40 years old to 60 years old during the period from 1960 to 1990.
On the other hand, infant mortality of developing countries is decreasing.
It has fallen from 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1960 to 100 deaths per 1000 births in 1990.
Therefore, health in developing countries has improved greatly.
This may be due to the two main facts.
First, with the development of economy, the people's life conditions and knowledge have improved, so they have better conditions to live longer, and take good care of infant [np6,s-] .
Secondly, the development of medical system [np6,s-] [cc2,s-] could cure more disease [np3,s-] than before.
From the above chart we can see that the life expectancy and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] had changed greatly in deveoping [fm1,-] countries from 1960 to 1990.
In 1960, the life expectancy was 40 years old and until [wd3,s-] 1990 it increased to 60 years old, 30 years older in 1990 than in 1960.
However, the infant mortaility [fm1,-] decreased.
In 1960, 200 infant [np3,1-] died [wd1,2-3] per 1,000 infants and it decreased to 100 deaths per 1,000 births.
What was the causes [vp3,3-] of the great changes?
First, the life of people in developing countries was better than before.
Most of them had enough to eat.
The nutritions [np5,-] of foods were more plenty too.
Second, most developing countries paid more attention to their medical structure [wd7,s-] .
They had better and more medicines and more precise medical instruments.
Of course, there were many other causes, but the two points above were the most important ones.
I am confident that the situtions [fm1,-] will be better in [pp2,-1] future.
People will live longer and the death, of infants will be less.
In developing countries, the life expectancy and infant mortality have changed a lot.
Based the chart has been given, we may know the following information.
In the 1960s, the life expectancy of the developing coutries [fm1,-] is 40 years old, but in the 1990s, It [fm3,-] is 60 years old.
From 1960 to 1990, the infant mortality is also different.
In the 1960s, there are 200 deaths in 1,000 births but in the 1990 There [fm3,-] are only 200 death in 1,000 births.
This is why?
In the 1960s, the developing countries are very poor.
The people of these countries have no enough food for eating, theire [fm1,-] economy develops very slow [wd2,2-] .
The condition of medical [wd2,2-] of these countries is rather poor.
So, the life expectancy in the 1960s in developing countries is low and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is high.
With the development of these countries.
all the condation [fm1,-] has changed.
theire [fm1,-] economy and medical cause [cc2,1-1] increase.
People realized that the heath [fm1,-] of the body is very important.
So, many changes have happed [fm1,-] .
From the table we can see that, in developing countries, the life expectancy was 40 years in 1960; but in 1990 [wd4,s-] was 60.
That is to say, the life expectancy has lenghented [fm1,-] 20 years from 1960 to 1990.
The infant mortality rate was 20% in 1960, which decreased 10% during the thirty years, indicating [wd7,s-] 10% in 1990.
I think there are two reasons for this changing [wd2,3-] .
Firstly, the economy in developing countries has developed, which betters the people's life and makes them gain better life conditions than before.
Secondly with the new technology applying to medicine field, doctors can cope with all kinds of diseases which they used not to [wd4,s-] , which contributes greatly to lengthen just the life expectancy.
I think with the development of the developing countries, the conditions will become better than this [wd3,s-] .
In developing country [np6,2-] , during the time from 1960 to 1990, life expectancy and infant mortality have changed very much.
In 1960, life expectancy was 40 and infant mortality was about twenty percent.
However, in 1990, life expectancy increased to 60, while infant mortality decreased to ten percent.
What did the changes bring [vp7,d] about?
The vital reason is developing economy.
With the developing economy, medicine is developing.
And people's living condition has made progress.
In 1960, in many developing country [np3,2-] , food is inadequate, medical condition is very bad .
Now, people had enough food and better medical condition.
They take [wd3,-3] attention to the relation between nutrition and health.
This is the reason of society developing [wd2,2-] , too.
According to the picture, we can get the conclusion that in developing countries, the life expectancy is becoming longer, and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] is discreasing [fm1,-] .
We can get the information from the picture, in 1960 the life expectancy is only forty years old, while in 1990, it is sixty years old .
For the infant mortaility [fm1,-] , in 1960 there is 200 deaths per 1000 births, in 1990, there is only 100 deaths.
The reason that caused these changment [fm2,-] exsits [fm1,-] in pointment [fm2,-] .
The most important reason is the development of technology.
It is the developing [wd2,-2] of the technology that cause the developing [wd2,-2] of people's living level.
The second reason is the development of medicine, this makes our body health .
Some sickness and disease [np3,3-] can be kept out of the door.
With the developing [wd2,-2] of technology, the life expectancy will be higer [fm1,-] , and the infant mortaility [fm1,-] will be lower.
We now can recgonize [fm1,-] that it is of most [ad2,-1] importance to develope [fm1,-] technology.
Since the 1960s, health conditioning [wd2,1-] of people has been improved greatly.
Fox example, during the thirty years from 1960 to 1990, the life expectancy has raised 20 years.
On the other hand, infant mortality has declined.
As the graph showed, 200 deaths per 1000 births in the year 1960, but till the year 1990, infant mortality has reduced to 100.
What may account for the change of life expectancy and infant mortality in developing countries?
In my opinion, this change is largely due to the development of developing countries economy.
With the development of economy, the people own more money and thus they may improve their life quality.
Secondly, the progress of medical business [wd3,s-] helps to reduce the infant mortality.
Thirdly, the stability of the developing countries may provide [vp1,-5] the people various comfortable surrounding, which to a certain content [wd3,4-3] contributes to make [vp5,2-5] them live better than ever, and in turn adds their life expectancy.
From this picture, we can easily obtaine [fm1,-] that during the past thirty years, life expectancy and infant mortaility [fm1,-] of the developing countries had taken [cc3,-2] great changes.
As it shows, in 1960 the life expectancy was only 40 years old, and infant mortaility [fm1,-] even reached [vp1,-3] to 200 deaths per 1000 births.
But till 1990 the life expectancy had increased to 60 years old and infant mortaility [fm1,-] had also [wd5,s-] reduced to 100 deaths per 1000 births accordingly.
With the development of the world economic [wd2,2-] , the developing countries also strenghthen [fm1,-] themselves in many field [np3,2-] .
As a result, the people of these countries have enhanced the living level.
At first they have more sufficient food supply, the strive [fm1,-] number has reducd .
Secondly, the medical infrastructure has get more efficient.
The disease [np3,-4] , especially the infective illnesses can be controlled.
The third reason is that people has [vp3,1-] become more concerned about their living habits and patterns, which providing [vp4,s-] a more sanitary and comfortable enviorment [fm1,-] for themselves.
In recent years, the life expectancy of developing countries is higher than before, while the infant mortality drops [cc5,-1] clearly.
People becomes [vp3,1-] more healthy.
From the two graphs we can learn, the life expectancy of the developing countries increased from 40 years old in 1960 to 60 years old in 1990.
On the contrary, the infant mortality in 1990 was 100 deaths per 1000 births, highly [cc6,-1] lower than 200 deaths in 1960, People's lifes [fm2,-] are longer.
There are three reasons suggested: First, with the development of social economic [wd2,1-] , more and more people of developing countries have shaken off poverty.
Second, improve [wd2,-2] medical conditions [cc2,-1] survive [cc2,3-] most of the infants.
Third, fewer wars and the peaceful situation is [vp3,6-] the most important reason.
Now, peace and development are the two most important problems in this world, and developing countries' people will be more healthy than it [pr1,s-] is now.
From this timetable [wd3,s-] , we can observe that the life expectancy increases nearly 20 years old from 40 to 60 and the infant mortality decreases greatly from 200 to 100 at a ratio of [wd4,s-] deaths per 1,000 births.
So we can conclude that health gains in developing countries has [vp3,5-] improved greatly in recent [cc4,-1] decades.
I think that the reason why health gains in developing countries developed quickly is various.
First, the development of medicine is the most important factor.
The technology of medicine is improving greatly today, which caused [vp6,s-] the increase of the life expectancy and decline of the infant mortality.
Second, the improvement of people's living standards is a factor as well.
With the development of the economy, more and more people pay their attentions to health.
Of course, other factors is [vp3,2-] important to health gains in developing countries.
People take it for granted that fresh water is unlimited, we can get [cc3,-6] no matter how much we want.
It isn't strange that people think so, because they think the resource of fresh water is rich, we also can obtain it in many ways [wd4,s-] rain, river, well and so on.
In fact, shortage of fresh water [cc2,s-] is very serious.
There are several reasons for this.
First of all, the population in the world increases rapidly.
Human beings demand more and more from the globe, especially the water, which is essential to life.
Secondly, every country tries its best to develop its industry as quickly as possible.
So more water is needed.
Besides, people keep water polluting [wd1,3-] .
In a word, global shortage of fresh water is one of the most serious problems [cc2,s-] facing us today.
I think people should take some steps to solve this problem, of course, firstly we should protect fresh water resouce [fm1,-] from polluting [vp7,s-] .
Then we have two ways [np1, 2-] : one is to reuse water, the other is to change sea water into fresh water.
Researchers have made progress [np6,2-] in this field.
I hope in [pp2, -1] future fresh water [cc2,s-] will not be short any more.
People always take it for granted that fresh water is much [cc6, -1] 
enough for us to use.
In their opinion, we can get fresh water from rain, river, lake, under the ground etc.
But in fact, we are very short of fresh water.
We can understand it from the following conditions [wd3,s-] .
First, with the increase of populations, people's need and use of fresh water has risen quickly.
Second with the dvelopment [fm1,-] of industry, the amount of fresh water used in industry is becoming larger and larger.
Finally, water pollution becomes much more serious than ever.
From this, we can see the global shortage of fresh water.
What shall we do [wd3,s-] with this?
Firstly, we should settle the problem of water pollution.
But in long [pp2,1-1] view, we should controll [fm1,-] [vp1,-3] the populations rising and find an enomical [fm1,-] way to take fresh water from the sea, which covers most [wd4,1-4] surface of the Earth [fm3,1-] .
People think that fresh water will never be used up.
We can't live without water.
We can get fresh water almost from everywhere.
People in the countryside get fresh water from wells, from rivers, from small streams and so on.
People lived [vp5,1-s-] in the city use cleaned water.
The water factory clean [vp3,3-] the water from rain or rivers and send it to families and other factories.
As if whenever we open the water tap, we will get fresh water.
But the reality isn't so grateful.
In fact, we are very short of fresh water.
As we know the population of the world is more than five billion.
It's much more than before and it will develop quickly and continuously.
But the fresh water is limited.
What make [vp3,1-2] matter worse is that factories use more and more fresh water.
Also [wd3, s-] many factories haven't enough facilities to clean the waste water before [wd4,s-] pour it into the river, so some of the rivers are polluted, the water from which can't be used to make fresh water.
And many of [wd5,1-1] forests have been cut down [cc3,s-] by human, so the temperature is getting higher than before, so much of the water is changed into steam because of the high temperature.
What shall we do then?
I think first we shall make [vp1,-2] know to everyone that the fresh water is in shortage.
Second, all of use shouldn't waste water.
Third, factories should be equiped [fm1,-] with high-quality facilities to clean the waste water.
Fouth [fm1,-] , the entire human race should protect the enviroment [fm1,-] to make a better world for our living.
So, remember that the global [wd2,-] is short of fresh water, don't waste it!
Most of us have a [np7,s-] concept [wd3,s-] that fresh water is normous [fm1,-] , we can't use it up forever, and we can receive it in many ways: rain water, river water, underground water, etc.
In fact, our fresh water is very limited.
Fresh water only take up about 2% of water source.
With the development of industry, lots of fresh water is used in it.
And pollution and population boom also increase [cc3,-2] the emergency.
Then what should we do about it?
we [fm3,1-] should realize the gravity [wd3,s-] and come up with some effective strageries [fm1,-] to that problem, reinforce the protection of our fresh water, clean polluted water.
we [fm3,1-] should keep in our minds that every drop of fresh water is precious.
For a long time, people have been thinking that fresh water can't be used up.
There are a lot of rivers and lakes on our planet.
And we can get plenty of water when it rains or snows.
Most of us will never worry about the shortage of fresh water.
In fact, we have the problem of global shortage of fresh water.
The world's population is increasing sharply, and many cities are short of drinking water.
Water is also needed in industry.
With the development of industry, water, which is the most important factor in production, is becoming more and more scarce.
However, some people are still polluting fresh water.
Water, which is the origin of human life, is facing danger [cc1,-2] of shortage.
What shall we do to solve the problem?
First, we must make everyone know the importance of fresh water, then the global shortage of it.
It's our duty to use water economically, to prevent it from being polluted.
I think, we must save the source of fresh water for ourselves and our children from now on.
Many people my think that water can't be used up.
They may say that there is much fresh water from raining [wd2,s-] , it may also be brought from lake [np6,s-] , well [np6,s-] and so on.
Therefore, they may believe that it is unnecessary for us to worry about the shortage of fresh water.
But, as a matter of fact, fresh water is very limit [wd2,2-] .
First, with the increasing population, fresh water which people use increases at the same time.
On the other hand, Because [fm3,1-] of the rapid development of indurstry [fm1,-] , water for [wd3,s-] it increases quickly.
Finally, owing to serious pollution, much water can't be used.
Then how should we deal with it?
I think many measures should be taken to deal with the shortage of fresh water.
We should make laws to control the birth rate and to prevent indurstry [fm1,-] from lay [vp5,3-3] out [wd3,1-] dirty water to the lake directly.
On the other hand, we should take measures to make the dirty water clean and we can use it again.
People alway [fm1,-] suggested [vp6,s-] [wd3,s-] that there is enough fresh water on earth.
They think that the fresh water can not be used up.
For instance, fresh water from the rain, the streams and the wells as well.
Fresh water is here and there.
However, fresh water is in short [wd2,1-] in the world.
The amount of human beings increases quickly.
The water is used [cc5,-5] by the fatory [fm1,-] very much.
The pollution is secious [fm1,-] .
All of these lead to global shortage of fresh water.
What can we do in this situation?
We must try our best to use the fresh water economically.
We must solves [vp9,1-] the problem of pollution to save our fresh water and limit the amount of people [cc1,3-] increasing.
Many people think that fresh water can't be used up.
The rivers flow year and [wd3,1-1] year.
And in many places, it rains a lot.
In many cities, water is supplied any time if wanted on a very low price.
It seems we have too much water to use it up.
In fact, there is a serious shortage of fresh water in the world.
The water consumption increases rapidly because of the progress of population and the development of industries.
In addition, lots of water sources were polluted and couldn't be use [vp9,1-] .
It is the [wd5,-2] high time for us to solute [wd3,s-] this serious problem.
Facing such a situation, many countries have brought out many steps to control the water consumption and the water pollution.
And more and more people begin to realize the importance of saving water.
If these steps work, we would have enough water in [pp2,-1] future.
Many people think that Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water will never be used up.
Fresh waster comes from rain, river, and so on.
Those people think that since rain and river-water [fm2,-] will be used for ever, Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water will also be used for ever.
In fact, Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is in a global shortage.
Firstly, with the increase of population, the number [cc1,-3] of Water [fm3,1-1] Fresh [wd1,1-] to be used increase [vp3,s-] , too: More and more Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is used to [wd3,s-] people's life.
Secondly, the development of industry call [vp3,4-] for a lot of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water.
Many factor [fm1,s-] need much Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water to make machines work, to produce products.
Thirdlly [fm1,-] , pollution is also a factor which leads to the shortage of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water.
Some factories neglect the enviorment [fm1,-] .
They let the factories' waste-water [fm2,-] flow into the rivers.
It pollutes the river-water [fm2,s-] .
Fourthly, with the increase of temperature, more and more rivers dry up and the number [cc1,-2] of rain also decrease [vp3,s-] .
Now what should we do?
Should we make best use of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water?
It is certainly the [np7,s-] important factor.
To make best use of Fresh [fm3,1-1] Water is the duty of every citizen.
Secondly, to protect the neat enviorment [fm1,-] is also important.
I think a piece of [np9,2-1] law should be made [wd4,s-] that the factory which let its wate-water [fm1,-] flow into the river [np6,s-] should be punished!
Many people may think that the fresh water will never [wd4,s-] out of [wd3,s-] using.
Because they think that there are many rivers in our world.
And there is raining [wd2,s-] and snowing [wd2,s-] in many places.
Perhaps some one [wd3,s-] may think there is a lot of ice in the south and north of the earth.
Whether the fact is what they think so?
However, there is [wd4,s-] global shortage of fresh water.
Today, fresh water is needed in many places.
But water polution [fm1,-] is more and more serious in our society.
For example, factories give [wd3,s-] the waste water into rivers and lakes, and many field [np3,1-] can not be watered [wd3,s-] with the poluted-water [fm1,-] .
Otherwise [wd3,s-] , global shortage of fresh water is also because of the increasing population.
So what can we do to solve the problem?
First, we may [wd3,s-] not waste the fresh water.
Second, measure [np6,s-] should be taken to keep the water from poluting [fm1,-] [vp7,s-] .
Above all, we may have a right situation [wd7,s-] to the shortage of fresh water.
"Haste makes waste" is an old saying of China.
Often [ad1,-3] people want to finish something more quickly, but often [ad1,-3] they can not do it well.
If someone seeks the speed when he is doing something, he (she) usually pay no attention to everything around him that can affect what he is doing.
Furthermore, he (she) can not concentrate on doing the things and make a mess of his project.
Thus, the things he (she) has done is in bad quanlity [fm1,-] , even nothing good can be found in the things.
That is, he (she) wastes time doing everything for he (she) seeks for haste.
In our life, such example can be found easily.
For example, during our country's construction, if we ignore all things around her and are eager to make our country develop more quickly and can't do it step by step, we will not succeed.
Many things have proved it.
So we can conclude that we mustn't seek for haste only but carry out everything step by step when we are doing them, otherwise we won't do everything well.
"Haste makes waste" is known by many people, but why does haste make waste?
There are many reasons.
Haste make [vp3,1-] [vp1,s-] you can't think [cc3,-4] about the thing enough, haste may make you excited or nervous, so you can't think carefully about what you must do, what you mustn't do and what method will be the best.
Or you may forget something important, it make [vp1,-2] you can't do what you will do sucess [fm1,-] .
For example, one morning you get up later [ad3,s-] , and you will be late to [wd3,s-] your work, so you are hasted [fm2,-] .
you [fm3,-] run down the stairs and run to your car then you find that you have left the key in the room.
So you run up the stairs.
And on the way to factory, because of haste you crash to [wd3,1-2] the tree on the side of stree [fm1,-] ....
So, by the end, you are be [wd5,1-1] late.
So, in many cases, haste makes waste.
Why do we usually say Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste?
It contains a commen [fm1,-] reason that we should do everything step by step.
A good base is very important.
Without good bases you couldn't reach the goal.
Sometimes people think that we should get success quickly.
But in the condition of without enough proporate [fm1,-] situation we can not do the thing that we oppricated [fm1,-] .
For example, in economic areana [fm1,-] people usually want to get advanced technology and management.
So people quote [wd3,-6] many work lines from other country.
But without adequate knowledge to use them, parts of them are lain out of the way [wd3,4-] .
Thus we wast [fm1,-] large exchange [wd7,3-] .
So haste makes waste!
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is on old saying.
It tells us that you should not be impatient and worried when you want to finish something as quickly as possible.
Meeting a difficulty thing, first you should think about it carefully, second you should do something to prepare for it, so you will get a good effect after you begin to do it.
Otherwise, you will not attain the aim that you expect.
For example, if you want to get [wd4,-2] a place by bicycle, but there is something wrong with the bicycle, before you begin using it, and you don't fix it.
So it will not work probably on [wd5,-3] the half way to the place, finally you will be late or can't get there.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is a good saying, we must remember it.
Every thing has its own regularity [wd3,-] .
When we want to do things more quickly, we should know their regularity [wd3,-] , and give [cc3,-2] a conclusion to them.
But the regularity [wd3,-2] is objective, not revert [wd3,s-] by the man's idea.
When we break the regularity [wd3,3-] , haste makes waste.
 [wd7,s-] 
We can see many things embody [wd3,s-] this theory.
When we cook, we make the fire big in order to eat the meat fast [wd3,s-] .
But, when we eat it, we find it taste [vp3,3-] [cc5,-1] ugly.
I think it [pr2,s-] is "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
 [wd4,-2] Other example, when we study history so many history books are in front of you, you want to be the [np7,s-] historian, so you read them one after one, not break .
At last you read them all, but, so many [np8,-1] knowledge in your mind only lead [vp3,7-] you into [wd3,2-] nothing.
You just swallow it, not digest it.
You spent so much time, but get nothing, it is the same words "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
So we should not haste [wd2,s-] to do the thing, we must depend on our own base.
"Haste makes waste", is one of the traditional and old precepts.
However, some people do not think that it is true or they think that it is true but do not act on it.
So it's necessary to illustrate and demostrate [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
In everyday life, we often have to do many things in limit [wd2,1-1] time, and we have to catch [cc3,-2] the time.
If we want to do them as quick [wd2,3-] as we can, we will become nerveous [fm1,-] and won't finish them in time.
So haste makes us nerveous [fm1,-] and disable us to do many things well.
Some workers who get up late and have to go to work on time usually make things worse.
They may forget to look [vp1,1-2] their house or to bring the key with them or to make their clothes well which often produces many jokes.
All these are resulted [vp7,s-] from their haste to reach office [wd7,s-] .
Haste makes waste.
If we are under limited conditions, we should have [wd3,-4] it in our minds that will make us do our things better.
The old saying "haste makes waste" [cc2,s-] is very familiar to us.
I think maybe everyone knows the reasons well.
First, one that wants to haste [wd2,s-] in a hurry often can't stop to think about the best way to success.
He always takes the wrong way and tries hard without any rewards.
Second, while in a hurry, he can't make the most of the helpful conditions which may accelerate his success.
Third, as is know [vp9,1-] to us, a good rest is very important for one to reach success.
Whoever keens [wd3,1-2] on success will neglect [wd3,s-] rest and do everything ineffectively.
For example, Li Ming, one of my classmates, who want [vp3,7-] to get a good mark on CET 4, spared every moment to study English.
In the morning after he gets up, he began [vp6,s-] reading English with a piece of bread in his hands.
In any class, he didn't listen to the teacher and did his English exercises.
At noon, he read English book again without having a rest.
At night, he often stayed up to [wd3,2-2] 12 o'clock.
However, about half a month later, he fell ill and couldn't read English again.
Due to the coming of the CET 4 test, he kept studying.
Unfortunately the day before CET 4 test he passed out [wd7,s-] and couldn't attend the exam.
In general, we must keep calm in front of success, consider [cc5,-2] everything well and think out a best way to success.
People always thinks [vp3,2-] that finishing things as fast as you can is a good thing.
Is it the case?
I say" No!
Haste makes waste.
"
In some cases, we have something important to do, but we have not enough times [np6,s-] , for example, we want to finish a drawing which have [vp3,4-] to be turned in.
If we do it in [pp2,-2] high speed, the drawing you finished is not a good one.
Perhaps the line isn't straight.
or [fm3,-] else [wd5,s-] , you like plantting [fm1,-] , but the tree can't brings [vp9,1-] [wd3,s-] up in days.
In [pp2,-2] this times [np5,2-] , we say "Haste makes waste" then, How [fm3,-] can we avoid "Haste makes waste"?
we [fm3,-] must take account in [wd3,2-] the rude [wd7,s-] of other.
We must base on the practise [wd2,1-] .
Obousing [fm1,-] the fact, doing our best, making use of times [np5,3-] , "Haste makes waste" will not happen any more.
Every one should be patient when he does work.
On the other hand, we couldn't work well without patience.
When somebody does his work hastily, the more he want to haste [wd2,s-] , the more he couldn't do [cc5,s-] his work with patience.
As a result he could never success [wd2,2-] his work as he want [vp3,1-] .
For example, when we want to fixture [wd2,-2] a bicycle, we should do this with patience.
Otherwise we must spent [vp9,1-] more time doing it on the contrary we want.
Also [ad1,s-] , when we want to work hastily, we couldn't concentrate on doing it.
This is the [wd5,s-] why haste make [vp3,1-] waste too.
For example we want to read a book quickly, thus, we couldn't spent [vp9,1-] more time concentrating on it.
So we couldn't get comprehension of it, and we couldn't get what we want.
We can work well with the brieve [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
Everything can be done well in a pamtience [fm1,-] way, that is: "There is a will, there is a way," People must do thing [np6,s-] with condience [fm1,-] , nothing can be done well in a hurry way [wd5,3-] , when we do business, study and do experiment, with filled [wd3,1-1] condience [fm1,-] and pamtience [fm1,-] are very important.
If we want to do something well in a sort [fm1,-1] time, it [pr1,s-] will make wrong, that is, haste makes waste.
Because things have a course of development, and most things have to be done in serveral [fm1,-] steps, especially, when we do something, there is a time before success, for example, we can't grasp english [fm3,-] grammar in a day; we can't reach the moon in a step; and we have to study for years before go to college.
Everything have [vp3,1-] to be done well in a course [wd7,2-] .
In conclusion, things can be done well if we have pamtience [fm1,-] and condience [fm1,-] , but haste makes waste.
When I want to do something, I know that I must do it step by step.
I will make more mistakes when I haste [wd2,2-] .
Because the anxiety disturbs [vp1,-s-] me that I can't concentrate in my operation.
Moreover, there are many accidents affect [vp4,s-] our life.
As I determine [vp1,-2] to haste [wd2,s-] , I will find that I have to face these accidents which I can't resolve [cc3,4-] .
At last, I will fail to arrive [vp1,-2] my object.
Once I took part in a [np7,-1] examine [wd2,1-] .
I wanted to finish it quickly and go [vp6,s-] to attend a party.
I read the paper so fast that I neglected many important words.
When I finished, I found out a lot of mistakes.
So I had to read it again.
But the time was over.
And I failed to pass.
We often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste," but what is [wd3,1-2] its [pr1,s-1] means?
Let us suppose you just want to reach a [np7,-1] object [wd7,-] , you is [vp3,1-] too serious to realize what you want, so you will spend all of [wd5,1-3] you have had in order to finish the thing.
But when you try, you will find out [wd5,s-] that you do not reach your object [wd7,-] , and you may turn back.
It is "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
We can have a [np7,-1] example.
In our country, 30 years ago, the country masters [wd3,s-] wanted to reach the object -- every one can get what he want, so they called on the people to do many things we could not realize.
The truth proved what they had decided was wrong, the lesson [cc2,-2] is hard.
What does the words --"Haste Makes [fm3,-] waste" mean?
It's not diffictcal [fm1,-] for you to guess its meaning.
That is, if you do something in a hurry way [wd5,3-] , you often can't get your attain [fm1,-] .
That is to say, whatever goals you want to gain [cc3,4-] , you should have enough patience and do everything step by step.
Perhaps, some of you still can understand it.
Then, let me give you a [np7,-1] example to illustrate it.
Suppose, you want to improve your English quickly.
If you force yourself to do many exercise [np3,1-] , and to learn hundreds of words everyday, you think you can learn English well in a short period?
Of course not, you should learn it step by step.
Because you only pay your atention [fm1,-] on the haste, but ignore the way.
 [wd7,s-] 
So, please do everything with patience.
The proverb "haste makes waste" is often seen in the books, such as textbooks, magazines, and so on.
But what does it mean?
It means that if you do things only for speed, you will not succeed.
And why it is [wd1,s-] true?
I will make it clear with some examples as follows:
From my experience, I do exercises very quickly in order to make [wd3,-2] some time for enjoying music, but I always find that there are many wrongs [wd3,s-] in them, then I am forced to find them out and correct them, and it takes me even more time than that of doing them at common [wd3,1-1] speed.
I often hear that in chess competitions, one is always lost in trying to defeat his opponent in less time.
They [wd3,-s-] are many events in history show [vp4,s-] the truth of "haste makes waste".
From the phrase "haste makes waste", we can learn much more than what I had [vp6,s-] said.
We should do thing [np6,s-] according to their properties, and we should not only seek less [wd3,s-] time.
Wanting to do something quickly but make [vp4,s-] a mess in the end, that is what calls "Haste makes waste".
Why does haste make waste?
It is very easy to understand it.
When a man is so eagerly [wd2,2-1] to finish something in a hurry, what loads [wd3,1-2] his mind might be "quick, quick and quick"; then he will forget to think over every aspects of the whole situation comprehesively [fm1,-] , he will forget to make preparations necessary [wd1,2-] .
To make it even worse, because he is in such a hurry that careliness [fm1,-] and patience needed in doing the work are rare.
Then, the only consequense [fm1,-] will be a mess.
An old Chinese story has the meaning of "haste makes waste.
" Once a father told his two sons to cut down some branches and gave them each a steeny [fm1,-] knife.
The first one took the knife immediately onto [wd3,s-] the forest in order to be back sooner than the other.
But the second one took a look at the knife first, then trid [fm1,-] to make it sharp despite his brother's going working earlier.
 [wd4,-3] The afternoon, the second one went home with many branches, but the first one came home very late and had little [np8,-1] branches, and said, "the knife isn't sharp completely [wd3,2-] .
I'm sorry.
" That is what the old saying says: "To make the knife sharp at first will gain much time.
" [wd7,s-] 
So, when you want to do something well, you must not haste [wd2,s-] but make sure everything have [vp3,1-] been prepared.
Why we usually say "Haste Make Waste"?
The following are some instances about it.
For example, in studying [wd2,1-] , we often want to be the first at once, however, if we don't study hard for a long time, there is no doubt that this is impossible.
The improve [wd2,1-] of community economy [cc2,s-] is the same reason, if there aren't enough foundments [fm1,-] of industry and agriculture in one country, this improve [wd2,1-] don't [vp3,2-] come into ture [fm1,-] at once, instead, this action of improving is dangerous.
 [wd7,s-] 
From the above following [wd5,2-] , we can say: "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
Many people know there is an old saying "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
But some of them do not understand it well.
They always think that the more quickly they do sth [fm2,-] , the more achievement they will get.
But it is not right.
Because when we do sth [fm2,-] , we should make a plan first, and obey many rules.
Or we will be at a loss, not knowing what should do [vp7,s-] and what should not do [vp7,s-] .
Two months ago, when I was having a maths lesson.
Just when the class was over, I heard the teacher saying " it [pr2,s-] would be an exam the next day, then I felt quite nervous.
Because I did not learn the lesson well.
As soon as I came back home, I brought out all the maths books and learned [cc3,2-1] it very carefully.
I was still learning [vp6,s-] deep into the night.
But the next day, when I get the exam paper, I was worried, Because [fm3,-] It [fm3,-] was not the maths exam paper, but an English one.
I felt very tired and I didn't pass the exam.
From the thing I have experienced, I know that when we want to succeed, we should remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" at any time.
And we should do things more careful [wd2,3-] .
Before [wd3,s-] , we had thought [vp6,s-] if we did something fast, we could get a good result, in fact, this idea is false.
Because haste makes waste.
Once, you decide to do something sucessful [fm1,-] you must put your heart into it, you must think of every details, you must spend much time on it, then you will be sucessful [fm1,-] .
Otherwise, you would be fature [fm1,-] .
For example, when we study English, at the beginning we started to learn English words, every day we must learn it, slowly and slowly [wd3,s-] we master more and more words, then we learned [wd4,s-] use of sentence [np6,1-] , we can speak English sometimes.
But it's [wd5,-s-] for me, this term I seldom learned it until last week, this week I studied it all day and all night.
 [wd7,s-] But now I couldn't [vp6,s-] do the paper well.
From this examination, I believe haste makes waste.
So I decide I will work hard from now on.
It is said that haste makes waste.
We all know it very well, but most of us do not know the reasons.
We often make this fault, when we do something, we always hope it finish more better [ad3,1-] more sooner [ad3,1-] .
This mood makes [vp1,-2] us going [wd3,s-] in an anxious state.
So our minds can't work effectively.
The progress of the work is slow [vp9,1-1] down.
Then, we became more and more anxiously [wd2,4-] .
The terrible circle [wd7,s-] is formed.
Haste makes waste.
There are a lot of examples in our daylife [fm1,-] .
When I must face to [wd5,3-2] the final-exam [fm2,-] , I have to review [cc3,-3] all the knowledge what [pr5,s-] I have learned in this term.
With the examing [fm1,-] day coming fast [wd3,s-] , I still have many works to do.
I hope these things were done quickly, but I have not so much time.
I'm busy in doing this and that, but nothing is well done.
I can't finish one thing if I still stick to use [wd2,2-] this method.
I must understand haste makes waste and cool down.
I must start from one thing and finish it before I have to [wd5,1-2] another thing.
Only in this way, I can make my study effectively [wd2,3-] .

A provd [fm1,-] says, "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
It means that sometimes people are anxious to achieve some thing, but because of carelessness or the other reason [np6,4-] , they usually fail in the end.
The phenomenon often happen [vp3,3-] in people's everyday life, for instance, three years before [wd3,2-3] when I studied in [wd3,-2] high school.
I wanted [wd3,s-] to go home on bicycle every other weekend.
Once it being dark, I'm so afraid of being caught in rain that I drove [wd3,s-] faster and faster.
But in the cross-road [fm2,-] , I was injuried [fm1,-] slightly, when the bicycle was turned over.
To make the matter worse, the parcel of books on the back of bike [np6,1-] was unwrapped and all books were scattered into apects [fm1,-] .
It took me half an hour to pick up them [wd1,2-] .
At last, it was still [wd3,s-] at seven in the evening when I arrived at house [np6,2-] .
Therefore, when we wanted to finish some thing in a short time, we must make [wd7,-5] good caution [wd4,-1] do [wd3,s-] with accidents.
Only if we do so, we can [wd1,s-] attain our aims.
Haste makes waste.
When someone haste [wd2,s-] in a work, he may be much [ad3,s-] careless than usual.
So some mistakes will be made by him, which just waste [vp3,s-] his time at work.
For instance, in ancient China there is [vp6,s-] a scholar planned [vp4,s-] to enter a city before sunset because the city door would be closed then.
Judged from the distance, it was possible for him to get there with [pp2,-2] normal speed.
But he just hasted [fm2,-] , and the books on the back of his horse which he drove [wd3,s-] fell to the ground.
After he piled [wd3,s-] up the books, it [pr2,s-] was not enough time to reach the city then.
So he wanted to haste [wd2,s-] just waste time.
For another example, you must catch a train in 2 hours.
And it is only one and a half hours' walk from your home to the railway station.
But you haste [wd2,s-] and are too careless to take something important with you.
When you remember it on the way and have to fetch, time is wasted.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is a saying that is used often by people.
But why we say" Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"?
There are two meanings in it.
 [wd7,s-] The first is people are too eager to make [cc3,-1] success, the second is people make acts [wd7,1-] when they don't find out good ways.
At [pp2,-2] this condition, good wishs [fm2,-] always don't bring good effect.
For example, in 1950's, the people in China were too eager to make our country in to [fm2,1-] a strong mordenizational [fm1,-] country, our leaders adopted the strategy of "The [fm3,-] great leap".
This strategy was very unthoughtful [fm2,-] .
So this strategy didn't bring our country advicements [fm2,-] , but also destroied [fm2,-] [cc5,-4] our country very much.
We should remember this lesson forever.
"Hates [wd3,-2] Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" make [vp3,3-] our many regrets [wd7,3-] , we should make [wd3,s-] lessins [fm1,-] in our life and stuies [fm1,-] .
Many people want to do something very quickly, and with little of [wd5,2-1] difficulties.
But, in fact, they can't realize [cc3,-2] their aims.
There is a raison [fm1,-] : Haste makes waste.
Firstly, we must consider [vp1,-2] of the situation where we are.
We can't do something that [cc2,1-3] is impossible to manage.
Secondly, we should be patient.
When we want to [wd4,1-1] something quickly, we often lose patience, and this will make our work more difficult.
Finally, there are many other causes, such as capablity [fm1,-] , money, circumstance, help from other people.
If we are impatient, we usually lose our heads [wd3,2-] and can't think of them [pr1,s-] .
So, all we try to do will becomes [vp9,1-] a kind of waste, a waste of force of man, a waste of money and a waste of time.
It is not difficult for us to find out the examples around us.
A student doesn't study well, but he want [vp3,1-] to catch up with the others in a short time.
So he does his best to realize it.
Times [np6,-s] passes away [wd3,2-] , but he finds he can't do so.
So he will be discouraged, and can't study as hard as before.
It's only a simple example, there are many others in our vie [wd7,2-] .
So, when we want to do something, we must remember the sentence: Haste makes waste.
And we can realize what we want to do much more facile [wd2,s-] and possible [wd2,s-] .
People always say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Wast [fm1,-] ," and I think it is very reasonable.
Whichever [wd3,s-] we wanted to do, we should do it step by step and can't [wd4,-1] impatient.
If we always complete it in very [ad2,-1] haste, we often make many mistakes even fails [wd2,2-] .
For example, we study English, if you want to grasp this language in few [np8,-1] time and I think it is impossible of [wd3,2-1] you to learn it well, because English as a subject you should know English new words by heart, study English grammer [fm1,-] and practice [cc3,-3] English spoken abilities and so on, and all this must spend your plenty [wd3,s-] time in grasping [vp1,-1] .
So, I think "Haste make [vp3,1-] waste" is a good guidance for us to do anything.
In our socialty [fm2,-] , [wd4,-3] Livings are progressing so fast that everyone believe [vp3,1-] time is money.
As a reason [wd3,2-] , we hurry to do everything we need to do.
But to our disappoint [wd2,2-] , the facts often are different with [wd3,2-3] our ideal thinks [wd2,1-] .
Why?
Let me tell you a phenomenom [fm1,-] in our studying living [wd2,2-] .
When [wd3,-1] examination, many students think time is not enough, so they finish papers fast then hand in them [wd1,2-] .
To their pity ,the marks are too low to pass the examination.
They [pr1,s-] told us that haste makes waste.
If we think carefully of it, we'll conclude that everything being [wd5,1-6] completed successfully must be prepared well.
Merely persuiting [fm1,-] haste will lead to failure innevitably [fm1,-] .
Do you think so.
It's the same with our socialist, at first, we declared that we'll [vp6,s-] enter communicate [wd3,s-] sociatist [fm1,-] in three months.
History proved it's impossible, so today, our government go to a right steadly [fm1,-] way [wd7,5-] .
We spend a wealthy life.
 [wd7,s-] 
Some people think that we must do everything as quick [wd2,3-] as possible, but is that be [wd5,2-1] so?
We all know the proverb Haste [fm3,-] makes waste.
It tells us that sometimes speed is not the most important things [np3,s-] .
First, we should do our homework before what we are going to do.
Whether we prepare enough or not directly influents [wd2,s-] our outcome.
Good prepares [wd2,1-] need a certain [wd5,1-1] time.
Second, the more quickly we do a thing, the more mistakes we are going to make.
For example, once doing a [np7,-1] experiment, I wanted to finish it in a very short time.
So I did in [pp2,-3] a high speed.
But after I finished, I found that there were something importance [wd2,1-] I had left out.
As a result, the experiment failed and I must do it again.
It took me much time to finish it.
So we can say that what it is important is how good [wd2,s-] not how quick [wd2,s-] we do a thing.
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is an old Chinese saying.
It requires people not to do things too quickly.
You must [vp9,-3] step by step, and you will laugh at last.
Why do people say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"?
As we know, everything has it's principle, has it's process.
You must obey [vp1,-2] to it, but not neglect it.
When you have great willing [wd2,2-] to finish it, you should set your heart [wd7,2-] peacely [fm2,-] , arrange [cc3,-5] all you [pr4,-2] whole matters correctly and then do it, otherwise, you will waste more time, even go backward for the factor [wd7,4-] you had done wrong.
That would prevent you from accompolising [fm1,-] them on time [wd4,s-] you predicted.
For example, in nighteen [fm1,-] sixties, our country had set up a wrong routine, which called [vp7,s-] "Great progress".
At that time, all people believed that they would jump into communist society in three years.
So they took everything that comsist [fm1,-] of iron into steel plant, in order to change them into steel.
But the result approve [vp3,1-] [wd3,s-] that it's a great wrong [wd3,2-] .
And after "Great progress" even our country [wd4,s-] backward a lot.
History [wd2,-1] experience alarming [vp4,s-] [wd3,s-] people "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
"
So, remember that old saying "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
" Do things step by step.
We often hear that haste makes waste.
Why?
Because if you haste [wd2,s-] , you always leave out a lot of details, for example, you want to improve your "comprehensive reading in a short term, so you do a lot of problem [np3,3-] in an hour, but you'll find it's [pr1,s-] still poor.
That's because you too haste [wd2,s-] that can't do a lot of details such as how to catch the main ideas, how to guess a word's meaning etc.
knowing [fm3,-] this you'll find that you improve little by little.
That's one of the reason [np3,3-] why haste makes waste.
There are some other reason [np3,2-] .
Such as haste makes you careless....
So when we do a work, we don't haste [wd2,s-] .
<TITLE Haste Makes Waste> <SCORE 10> <ID 445625>
Some people often like doing things quickly.
They think the more quickly they do a thing, the more wonderful consequence they will get.
But it is not the case.
Why haste makes waste?
Because when you want to finish an important thing in a quick way, you always can not think of [wd3,1-3] a correct way or a wonderful method carefully.
And something always can not be well done without the correct way.
For example, you want to go to the Great Wall for a visit.
You have longed for it.
And you hope to go there immediately.
So you forget to take some necessary things with you, for example medicine.
When you reach the Great Wall, and unfortunately get a fever; you have no medicine to overcome it.
Finally you can not visit the beautiful scene on the Great Wall.
As we all know, haste makes waste.
But what it means and why haste makes waste, I think, most people don't know.
Now I tell [vp1,-2] you below: the mean [wd2,-1] of the [wd5,-3] haste makes waste is if you want to do something, the haste will lead to failure or make you have to spend more time in finishing it.
Now I tell you why haste makes waste.
The reason is that you lose your patient [wd2,1-] and you didn't consider it carefully before you do something, such makes waste.
For example, if you want to build a high house, you must build it from the first flore [fm1,-] to the highest flore [fm1,-] .
If you want to build the highest flore [fm1,-] without the first flore [fm1,-] , I think, that is impossible.
So you must build you [pr4,-1] house step by step with good material [np6,2-] , otherwise, you can't finish it.
Since we have known the reason why haste makes waste clearly, why we can't [wd1,s-] use it?
An idiom says that "Haste [fm3,-] makes waste".
It means when you are too impatient to cut across for a result, you'll always fail.
Everything, and every process has [vp3,4-] its own course.
It initiates develops then culminates, and then gets an end.
Sometimes if we want to fasten it [pr1,s-] , we only spoil it.
In this [pr1,s-] way, we prevent it from developing in its due course.
Perhaps that's the reason why haste makes waste -- we'll waste our energy, time and money if we haste [wd2,s-] impropely [fm1,-] .
I have some painful experiences on it [pr1,s-] .
Did [vp6,s-] you ever climb a hill?
I always get so excited that I climb up at my full speed.
But since I'm not strong enough, I am exhausted at merely the half [wd4,-2] the distance.
The result is that I am always the last one to get [wd4,-2] the summit.
That's [pr2,s-] the same in [wd3,3-] our study.
It's impossible for us to see a [np7,-1] English word and remember it at first sight.
If you glance at it then pass by you'll find you get nothing in mind when you finish a vocabulary book.
That's do our job in its due course.
Many people may think [vp1,-2] haste as a good thing.
But in fact, haste usually makes waste, as is different with their ideas [wd7,5-] .
Many people had wanted [vp6,-s-] to finish something quickly.
On account of it [pr1,s-] , they acts, but not as usual methods [wd5,5-] .
They think finishing is the main object, while the qualities are unimportant.
So they cut down some important materials, even which act key uses [wd7,3-] .
It is reported that a bridge is damaged in a heavy wind because of its bad quality.
It is said that the builder cut down some materials in order to finish it quickly.
It is a pity that this kind of accident happened in our country.
Things develop as [wd3,s-] their ruler [wd3,4-] .
But haste making waste damages this ruler [wd3,s-] .
So it is certant [fm1,-] that haste makes waste.
People often say "Haste makes waste".
Why, to finish a thing need [vp3,4-] some time to prepare, to do carefully.
If for less time, [wd7,3-] there would be somethings [fm2,-] neglected.
Because of the absence of these nessisary [fm1,-] things, the object won't be realized, and the other things we have done are waste [vp9,s-] .
That is "Haste makes waste".
In our study some students read the English words all day and all night in order to maste [fm1,-] the English in the least time.
But in fact, they can't make a progress in English study.
they [fm1,-] [fm3,-] waste much time.
Because the English study doesn't only meant [vp9,2-] reading words, but grammar and others.
Furthermore, they don't [wd3,s-] remember too many words, for it is only in use that they can remember them.
that [fm3,-] is "Haste makes waste" also.
Some people admire quickness.
They believe doing things quickly means high efficiency.
But I don't think it is always the truth.
In my opinions [np3,2-] , haste usually makes waste.
Because, as to the subjective [wd3,-1] world, everything has its own principle of development.
They adherent [wd2,1-1] to the principles, which means we should pay good [cc4,-1] attention to the principles.
Everyone who breaks the rules will surely fail.
On the other hand, as far as man is concerned, haste sometimes leads to the nevious [fm1,-] state.
So the things which we should have easily accomplished become difficult.
Furthermore, we always think less in order to do things quickly.
All the reasons will cause failure.
As [wd3,-3] my own experience, one day, when I was doing my housework, my friends called me to play football half an hour later.
In order to finish the job within thirty mintes [fm1,-] , I did the housework very quickly with little think [wd2,1-] .
At last, although I finished the work on time, I was criticed [fm1,-] by my teacher the next day.
So, in doing everything, we should not only chase quickness.
Compared with time, the quality is more important to some extent.
If we will only pay more attention to the rules of things' development and be more carefully [wd2,1-] , we could get good results.
One of the old sayings says: "Haste makes waste.
" There are two reasons for it.
First, things must be done step by step.
If you're in a hurry, you'll probably skip some step which seems unimportant but are actually essential.
Second, If [fm3,-] you want to finish doing something quickly, you must be too nervous to work properly.
As a result, you will fail eventually when you ignore some necessary steps or do something wrong.
Almost everyone has such experience.
For example, A housewife will often forget to light a fire before cooking when she wants to prepare a meal in a short time.
Or she will probably add some sugar into the dishes instead of salt.
When these things happen, She [fm3,-] must do it again.
That's called "Haste makes waste.
"
Why does haste make waste?
There are several reasons.
First, we always need some indispensible [fm1,-] preparations before we manage to finish a task.
It seems that these work [np3,1-] are unnecessary, but they are often essential for the success in the future.
On the other side, If [fm3,-] we want to reach our goal, we must follow the right instruction properly.
That is, we must carry out the procedure step by step.
Sometime [wd3,s-] , even if you omit a minor step, the whole thing will fail and you have to start all over again from the very beginning.
In fact, it is a waste of time to finish work in a hurry and come out with [wd3,2-4] a bad outcome.
I remember that once I wanted to finish an experiment ahead of time so that I could attend a party on time.
I omitted some steps which I considered "not important".
The result turned out to be a bad one.
I made a mess of my experiment and had to do it once more.
At the same time, I missed the party.
So, we can draw a conclusion that haste can cause failure and fault.
If we want to save our time, then, don't do things in a hurry.
Follow the right way and you can get the best results.
As a long [cc4,-1] saying, haste makes waste.
Many people believe this because they have experienced so much.
So much failures have told them that "haste makes waste.
" On many occassions [fm1,-] , we may need to do things of our own time, [wd7,4-] but on [pp2,-2] the end, we may fail because we do them in a hurry.
What [pr5,s-] did this happen?
First, haste makes us impatient, and there are more chances that we do [wd3,-2] some mistakes.
Second, we may neglect some important things.
Furthermore, haste to some extent causes [cc3,-2] more time, more energy and even more material.
This is much important in the chemistry field.
One day, I was asked to make some medicine solve in 500ml water.
In addition, the water must be added more and more [wd3,3-] .
In order to do it quicklier [fm2,-] , I at a blow [wd3,2-] added 500 ml water to the medicine, and then stir it quickly.
What it is [wd1,s-] now?
Even I stir so [wd3,s-] hard, still some medicine disolved [fm1,-] .
How [pr5,s-] can I do now?
I had to weigh some medicine again.
This time I added the water by and by [wd7,2-] and I finished the experiment in the end.
When you are doing some research, when you are a real practicer [fm1,-] , please remember "haste makes waste".
This is my best advice.
"Haste makes Waste [fm3,-] " is a common idiom.
But why?
Because when you are in a hurry, you may do without consideration, and you are likely to act against the principles.
When you act against the principles, then [wd5,s-] , what you do can only bring you the opposit [fm1,-] result.
Although this idiom is known widely, people tend to haste [wd2,s-] spontaneously or unconsciously.
For example, in the ancient China, a farmer was anxious with his crops.
Why don't they grow faster, in such a sunny day?
I should work out a method to help them, he thought.
But how?
At last, he got an idea.
Then he went to the field, pulled the crops to a satisfactory height, and returned home to wait for the harvest.
And you can imagine what he ended up in at last.
This story is famous almost all over China.
It may warn us that haste makes waste when we tend to do something without caution.
Haste makes waste, is an old Chinese saying.
It means if you hurry to do something, you will often fail to get to the desired goal.
The reason [cc2,s-] may be the following two points.
First, when you are in a hurry, you can't get every thing ready before you begin the job.
So you'll find something necessary has been forgotten when you are doing the job.
And you have to return to the beginning.
Second, if you are [wd4,-1] hurry, you must be impatient.
When you met with something unexpected, you won't deal with it with a patient heart.
And the difficulty will often can't [vp9,2-] be solved.
There are many examples that can prove the saying.
The following is a simple one.
A boy was afraid of going to school late so he did every thing in a hurry.
When he get [vp3,s-] to school, he found he had forgotten to take the homework which will be handed on [wd3,1-] .
So he had to return home to get the homework.
Because he was too hurry [wd2,s-] to get the homework, he was late at last.
The saying tells us that before you want to do something successful [wd2,2-] , you won't [wd3,s-] do it in a hurry.
It's better for you to think it over before you do it.
It's [pr2,s-] an old saying that: Haste makes waste.
No matter which country you are come [vp9,s-] from, you must be familiar with it.
So what make [vp3,1-] [vp1,2-5] peoples drew [vp4,2-] that conclution [fm1,-] ?
Imagine that you are struggling in the crowd of people, who are eager to registe [fm1,-] at the begining [fm1,-] of a term.
You'd filled the form as quickly as you could, and now you are [vp6,s-] at the head of a long line.
But just at that time, it occurs to you that you have failed to fill the form completely.
What a pity!
You have to go back and to [wd5,4-] wait for a [np7,-1] unbearable long time!
Then one of your classmate [np3,3-] , who are [vp3,s-] now at the head of the line, speaks to you with a big [cc4,-1] smile on his face: "Hi, haste makes waste!
"
Since when people are in a haste, they often can't think throughly [fm1,-] about the situation, so that's common for them to make a lot of mistakes.
Remember that old saying: Haste makes waste, and think twice before you make up your mind to do something, then you'll undoubtedly achieve more than you ever expected [vp6,s-] .
Sometimes old sayings can helps [vp9,1-] a lot.
 [wd4,-2] Comporatoary [fm1,-] days, efficience [fm1,-] plays essential role [np6,2-] in competitive cases [wd3,s-] , which people crazily persue [fm1,-] .
But don't forget "Haste makes waste".
Why?
For one thing, unmature [fm2,-] proposition and uncorrect [fm2,-] assay will often be projected in haste.
 [wd7,s-] They should actually lead to a bad result; Secondly, haste uncertainly [wd3,s-] makes more product [np3,1-] or more profits, but [wd4,s-] waste.
High quality could makes [vp9,1-] more profits than great quantity.
A bankrupting [wd2,-3] of one enterprise can be exemplified as "Haste [fm3,-2] makes Waste".
It gets good reputation in social [wd2,1-] earilier [fm1,-] .
Its productive [wd2,1-] are all over the world.
And the qualities are the warrant to its profits.
For some reasons, producting [fm2,-] speed was improved to get more efficiences [fm1,-] .
Firstly, it [pr1,s-] takes more profit by it [pr1,s-] .
But, later, people find that most of it [pr4,-1] products were fake.
And it bankrupt [vp3,1-] [vp1,1-] !
In a world [wd3,2-] ,"Haste [fm3,-2] make [vp3,1-1] Waste".
As the proverb [cc2,-1] says "Haste Makes Waste".
In other words when we do anything, we must consider about the practical things and gain success step by step.
If we have too big ambition and want to succeed in a short time, we'll fail in the end unless by [wd3,-3] a [np7,-2] evil way.
And we have to [cc3,2-4] be waste of time.
There are many examples in our daily life about the proverb.
Some students want to study well.
And they read many books rapidly without comprehension.
After some time, they not only make not [wd3,1-1] development, but also find the errors in homework increase even the speed of reading improves.
Some traffic accidents are also caused by the reason [wd3,s-] .
Drivers dive [wd3,s-] fast and have no time [wd4,2-1] avoid colliding when finding other vehicles come to them.
If we notice, we can find [cc3,-2] the proverb around us.
Everyone want [vp3,1-] to succeed in any position, but we should plan to accomplishment [wd2,2-] according to what we are really [wd7,5-] .
We should remember the proverb whatever we do [ad1,s-] , and use it in our daily life.
"Haste makes Waste [fm3,-] " is very reasonable scentence [fm1,-] .
If somebody wants to do something quickly, he thinks all about how to increase speed in his mind, so he is easily [wd2,2-1] to neglact [fm1,-] something important and useful that sometimes determine whether he can compelete [fm1,-] the thing successfully.
Therefore, he can not do the thing well and he must do it again, More time has been wasted insteads [fm2,-] of high speed.
In our study of English, we often meet some problems which show the meaning of "Haste makes waste".
For example when we learn some new words some students want to learn a number of new words in a short time by reading or writing them again and again.
But a few days after [wd3,3-] , they find those new words are still new words, we should study new words gradully [fm1,-] .
We learn a few words a day and after some time we have to review them again and several times we can crasp [fm1,-] them formly [fm1,-] .
Hast [fm1,-] makes waste.
Whatever we do, we should remember it.
For some reasons, we think that haste makes waste.
For one thing, people do something which were [vp3,2-] not thought over often result in failures .
Because people want haster [fm2,-] , they must spend less time in preparing for nessisary [fm1,-] thing; for another thing, some difficutys [fm1,-] should be thought [cc3,3-] before people do a thing, yet, people persure [fm1,-] haste and forget these difficult [wd2,1-] , so, when they confronted them, they had no ideas.
Finally, something [cc2,s-] must have plent [fm1,-] of time to do.
Study is a case in point, learning knowledge is a long-run course [wd7,-] .
From primany [fm1,-] school to high school, and from high school to college, we have learned [cc3,-5] a great deal of knowledge which couldn't acquire [vp7,s-] in short time.
If you want [vp1,-1] become a college student in short terms [wd7,-] .
It is not possible.
You must learn [cc3,-1] knowledge from begining [fm2,-] .
So haste makes waste, it is a truth for everything we want for ever [wd7,6-] .
Are you to succeed in something?
Please remember: haste makes waste!
<TITLE Haste Makes Waste> <SCORE 8> <ID 445401>
There is an old saying:" Haste makes waste," It [cc2,s-] says that when you are doing something, you can't be in too much haste, or you will get an inexpective [fm2,-] result.
In other words, you must be patient, because impatience often makes you not consider carefully.
For example, many students want to pass the Band-six college English text [wd3,s-] , but in the text [wd3,s-] , they were so intensive [wd3,s-] that they forget [vp6,s-] many words what [pr5,s-] they had accumulated, they finished quickly but at once [wd3,1-] made a lot of mistakes.
Finally they got bad performance.
Not only to us, but to our country, the saying is correct too.
The Culture Revolution gave our nation a lesson that Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
We didn't know step-by-step [wd2,1-] -- we were too eager to turn our ideal into reality, the result of which make our country fall back.
Now we must remember it.
People often say," Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
On some occasions, though we want to get one thing done well and quickly, it turns out that we fail [vp1,-2] to it.
It is true that sometimes haste makes waste.
The hastilier [fm2,-] you get along with [cc3,2-2] a thing, the more waste time you will get.
 [wd7,s-] 
Why does haste make waste?
Because you can't make a full preperation [fm1,-] for the thing you are going to do in such a short time.
Then you have to turn back and do it again.
Thus you will spend more time on the thing, than before.
Therefor [fm2,-] , "Haste makes waste.
"
There are some examples on this case.
For instance, once when I was in an exam, I wanted to finish the paper quickly, so I did not hear what the teacher had told the student [np3,s-] .
As a result, I made a wrong understanding of the question and failed the exam.
In a word, when you are about to do something, you must do it after a full consideration.
Otherwise you will lose [wd3,s-] it.
Don't forget, "Haste makes waste".
In an old sayings [np3,2-] , that is "Haste makes waste".
Why does people say so?
When one meets difficulty, he will be afraid.
It is the same as haste.
 [wd7,s-] Since he was afraid, how could he do something well?
He would always do it badly even lead something to be no valuable.
 [wd7,s-] Moreover, while one is haste [wd2,s-] , he may want to do something in another [wd3,1-1] ways.
Since he is haste [wd2,s-] to change his minds.
In general, he can't do it well.
So we say "Haste makes waste".
For example.
If we want to pass CET-6 exam, we must prepare it carefully, so we must start to prepare it long before.
But if we want to pass it yet just prepare it hastely [fm2,-] , of course, we can't go over most of the books carefully.
As a result, we [cc2,s-] might be difficult to pass it.
After all, if we want to do anything success [wd2,2-] .
We mustn't be haste [wd2,s-] .
We must prepare it adquately [fm1,-] .
Haste can't contribute to success.
The success is base [vp9,3-4] on the many aspects, including time, hard work, means and so on.
When a child want [vp3,2-] to learn to run, he sould [fm1,-] first need time to practise walking.
After mastering the skill of walking.
He is permitted to right means [wd7,3-] to practise running.
So if you want to suceed [fm1,-] , you should not Haste [fm3,-] [wd2,s-] , because it makes waste.
The most [wd4,-1] waste is the waste of time.
In China, There is [wd4,1-2] old story implies [vp4,s-] the statement.
Two young people were cutting wood in the mountain.
One of them made his knife [wd3,s-] sharper before cutting, so he cut wood quickly and efficiently.
And the other didn't do like that, no doubtly [fm2,-] , he spent much more time than the first one in cutting the wood.
In this story, we can easily conclude that Haste [fm3,-] really makes waste.
When we do something important at uncommon speed, people always tell us "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
"Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste" is an old-saying that means if we want to complete something successfully, we should do it careful [wd2,2-] rather than do it so fast without any care, or it may waste your time.
There are many examples that we can see every moment in our lives.
 [wd7,s-] For instant [wd2,1-] , while a student attends a [np7,-1] exam, finishing test paper very quickly often results in worse [cc4,-1] marks.
Because there are always many details which he didn't pay attention to.
That makes him lose his scores.
Another example, is, when we plant a flower, we must water it once or twice a day and place it in the sunshine occasionally, but we can't water it again and again in one day to hope it flower faster, which must kill it in the end.
Those all opposites [wd3,s-] to "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
It [fm1,-] a word, though time is very precious, we should well-spend [fm2,-] it to do important things because of "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
A proverb says "Haste makes waste", which means some people often make things more terrible [wd7,3-] than they expected before because of their haste.
Everything has its own process consisted of many steps, we cann't [fm2,-] leave out some steps which seem to be less important only want to finish it more quickly.
And we must think carefully about the problems that probably occur and the details that may be ignored before we set out to do a work.
Haste usually bring [vp3,2-] about a failure.
For example, when a teacher modifies the [np7,s-] exam, a student doesn't listen carefully while does his paper, finally he gets the wrong answer only because of his intention of finishing the paper as fast as he can.
In fact, spending such a few minute on teacher's words doesn't affect the fulfill [wd2,1-] of the exam.
And in our normal [wd3,s-] life, there are many instances.
that [fm3,-] haste makes waste.
We should make [cc3,-3] a full consideration when we prepare to do a thing.
We often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
If we do a business too hastly [fm1,-] , without considering fulling [fm1,-] , we can not find the best way to do it.
If we don't predict the difficulty we may face, when we face it, we must be puzzled and can't find the way to solve it promptly, then we will fail.
Furthermore, if we don't consider the essential preparation, when we do the business halfway, we should go back and make up it, then we waste time and can't finish the business on time.
So we say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
For example, when we learn English, we should remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
When we are learners, we should learn the simple words firstly [wd2,4-] .
If we cross over [cc3,1-3] the simple words and read the complex texts, we must find great difficulty reading it [pr3,s-] and losed [fm2,-] interest, then we can't master English forever!
"Haste makes waste", even though these are old, words, they mean a lot.
Sometimes, people want to finish works or get to [cc3,1-1] achievement [wd4,s-] doing a short period, but every problem need [vp3,2-] resolving regularly, and you must do orderly and carefully.
Some people want to hurry, he often doesn't know what to do first and also do a lot of things in a time, [wd7,s-] so, he maybe [wd3,1-1] careless and subtle [wd7,-] of what he has done and what is to be done, as a result, come to false .
I remember when I was a high school student of greet [wd3,5-1] two, find [vp6,s-] test [np6,1-1] was coming but I [wd4,1-1] still indulged in playing, I thought, I was clever, and two days before the test was enough to me.
When the "two days" come [vp6,s-] , there were some [wd3,-2] many things to read, I read here a little there a little [wd3,5-] , but remember nothing, so, finally, I didn't pass.
It is a pity, but I learned a lot.
An old saying goes [wd4,s-] that "Haste makes Waste [fm3,2-] ".
It means when you haste [wd2,s-] in doing something, you'll probably miss your goal.
Since everything you do requires a certain process, you may as well follow the process.
If you want to cut across, then you will leave this or that detail that has important effect on the whole thing but you're unconcious [fm1,-] Such omitting [wd2,1-] may lead to your failure.
The following example is just what I experienced now [wd3,s-] .
I'm always afraid of compisition [fm1,-] writing, its time limit is so short-30 minutes.
There's no time for drawing a draft, so there're so many corrected [wd3,s-] places in the paper.
As to the example, I have thought for a full ten minute which example is comherent [fm1,-] to the subject.
Now, these is only 5 minutes left for me to finish the writing.
At first I was in a hurry for a quick comprisition, [fm1,-] but now I can only squeeze through it.
Now I've attained a thorough comprehesion [fm1,-] of the saying "Haste makes waste".
And you?
The development of a certain thing needs a certain period of time to [cc2,s-] conduct [cc3,-3] the certain procedure.
If we don't proceed along [wd3,-2] the procedure for saving time, the thing will be spoiled.
So it is common to say that haste makes waste.
One old story [cc2,s-] says the following.
A silly farmer wished his crops to grow rapidly, so he draw each of them up a little every day.
Then, a few days latter, all the crops died.
The story tells us to be patient when we work.
For another example, when we are cooking, we must be patient too.
If we haste [wd2,s-] , the food will possibly come out to be burnt or still raw.
The course of study is the same case.
We can't learn everything in one day.
In one [pp2,1-1] word, we must make the best use of time, but not to waste [wd4,s-] .
"Haste makes waste," had been said by people in our country long log ago.
It also lies in our modern society now.
More quickly you do something, the more impossibility you have to succeed, because of your carelessness, lack of consideration, or your mistakes.
If you finish your work or study in a hurry, you won't achieve a satisfied [wd2,-1] consequent.
You must have a plan several months, two or three day [np3,1-] , or no more than several seconds, before you decide to accomplish your work.
For example, a man plan [vp3,2-] to product [wd2,2-] a small store of his own.
If he performs his plan in a hurry without consideration, he might be failure [wd2,3-] in a short time.
Because he forgets "haste make waste.
" But if he goes to [cc3,1-1] [cc3,1-2] plan well, he will succeed.
It's said that haste makes waste.
When one wants something to be done more quickly, he tends to using [vp5,2-] less time.
But in the end, he always makes things worse.
During the procession [wd3,s-] he may get lost and performs [vp1,-1] wrong.
He is wasting the time actually.
Everything [cc2,-4] has its own way to be carried out.
In order to get what we want, we must do it orderly and paiently [fm1,-] .
There are many instances that indicate this famous saying.
For example in order to win a chempion [fm1,-] in a sports meeting, one exercises every day before the meeting.
He never stops and has a rest during those days.
However, some [wd3,s-] day before the meeting he got sick for [wd3,-3] his over done [wd3,1-] .
On the contrary, he lost the chance of winning the champion.
We must know that the [wd5,-1] Rome isn't established [wd3,2-] in one day.
So we can do everything better.
A [np7,-2] old saying goes [vp1,-4] "More haste, less speed".
Why?
When we do many a thing especially more important [wd4,s-] , we try our best to apply [wd7,-1] it [pr3,s-] as fast as possible.
But we [cc2,-3] are so obvious that sometimes we can fail in the end.
A man who have [vp3,3-] achieve [vp9,1-] much success must be patient and takes steps when their causes are under way.
Many people when they work are often easily dispointed [fm1,-] and stop halfway, For example my friend Li Hai is such a man.
Usually he attempts a lot of things, but seldom [ad1,-2] he can acquint [fm1,-] the good result.
On the other hand, some people can attain their goals with inflexible spirit.
Sun Zhougshan.
Many attempts failed, but he held to his purpose with firmness and finally success [wd2,s-] in over throwing [fm2,1-] the Qin [fm1,-] Dynasty.
Thereby when we do something use should take steps and establish a schiedule [fm1,-] primarily and according to the plan go on it.
Otherwise not only can [wd1,s-] we not attain our aims but also we may lost [vp9,1-] our couragement [fm1,-] .
We always wish [vp1,-1] finish our tasks quickly.
But we always find it is too bad.
Sometime [wd3,s-] , something [cc2,-4] wants to be done step by step.
Thing [np6,-s] is done after another things have been finished.
 [wd7,s-] Wanting to get to [cc3,1-1] aim [np6,s-] , we sould [fm1,-] do it step by step.
For example, studying English.
We wish we are able to write conversition [fm1,-] .
First, we must be able to write words and grasp grammer [fm1,-] .
Furthermore, we must read, write and practise [cc3,-1] quantity.
When, these are done, we must learned [vp9,1-] [vp1,-1] thinking.
Using our brains, observing things around us, we must to [vp9,1-] be able to write conversition [fm1,-] excellently.
If our words is too poor and our grammer [fm1,-] is very mess [wd2,2-] , we must [wd3,s-] not write conversition [fm1,-] .
So we can say: "Haste makes waste".
People often say that haste makes waste.
What does it mean?
Perhaps it means that when one wants to do something in a hurry, he often fails to do it, at the same time, he waste [vp3,1-] his time.
In our lives, we can see several examples that show us that haste makes waste.
The easiest example may be our study in [pp2,-1] school.
When the examinations are round the corner, we are nervous and have a strong feeling that we must go over all the courses as fast as possible.
As we sit at the desk, we can't pay attention to the text, or we can't remember what is said in page [np6,1-] at all.
This can be said 'haste makes waste'.
So when we decide to do anything, we should pay attention to this, and not to make such mistakes.
People often say: "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
", which tells us that we should prepare fully and do things step by step, or we will fail.
Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste.
This word contains several kinds of meaning [np3,2-] .
One [wd3,s-] , when you do something hastily, your rediation [fm1,-] isn't full.
When you need something, you can't find and remember them [pr3,s-] .
You will found [vp9,1-] the only way [wd7s-s-] , which is giving it up.
 [wd7,s-] Another is that you can't haste [wd2,s-] when you do something.
You should search for the solution first, then find out the way of dealing with the problem.
Step by step, when you learn about the solution and the way,you can do it.
If you don't act this way, you will make mistake [np6,1-] .
Fox example, there were a man long long ago.
He planted some crops in the farm.
He wanted the crops to grow faster.
So he pulled the crops up, All of the crops died in the end.
Haste Make [vp3,1-] [fm3,1-1] waste.
We say that this word is a correct solution to deal with problems.
when [fm3,-] solve problems, we should act as this word [wd7,3-] : Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
There is a saying --"haste make waste" in our country.
It means that you want [vp1,-1] do something quickly, but it always make [vp3,2-] [vp1,-5] you can't do it perfectly, and even make things worse.
Why do we say "haste make waste.
" Now, First [fm3,-] , when you are [wd5,1-1] hasten, you won't do work careful [wd2,2-] and prcisly [fm1,-] , and you will make more undetected mistake [np3,2-] in you [pr4,-1] work, for example when you are reading a book, if you are [wd5,1-1] hurry [vp1,-2] about it, you will overlook many important points, and it is so much so [wd5,s-] that you can't catch on immediatly [fm1,-] then you are wasting time virtually.
Second, the more you want to minius [fm1,-] the time you work the more you must keep up with your think [wd2,1-] , and then you must digest the more unfamliar [fm1,-] thing [wd7,2-] , and it will make you confused.
Therefor [fm1,-] when you [wd4,s-] do a thing better you shouldn't "haste" [wd2,s-] and then you will probably do it successfully.
"Haste makes waste" is the [np7,s-] famous saying.
It [wd3,-3] is to say, the more you will [wd5,s-] want, the less you will get.
When you do something, if you are hasted [fm2,-] , you can't do it carefully, there are [vp3,1-s] much detail you will omit and there are much [np8,-1] errors you will make.
When the thing is finished, the end is worse than you want [wd3,s-] .
It is also worse the you do it carefully.
 [wd7,s-] 
There are many example [np3,1-] .
As far as study [wd2,-1] English is concerned, it [pr1,s-] is a case in point.
It is well known, [wd4,s-] the English study is a slow course.
To rember [fm1,-] the new words, you shold [fm1,-] remeber [fm1,-] [cc5,-4] it again and again, and you should remeber [fm1,-] the words not too much you want to rember [fm1,-] the news [wd2,-1] words a hundred one day, [wd7,s-] tomorrow you will forget 99 of them.
Let us rember [fm1,-] the saying "Haste makes waste", to do every thing carefully and slowly.
There is an old saying, "Haste makes waste".
It means one always can't realize [cc3,-2] his purpose if he does it [pr1,s-] in a hurry.
Why does [wd3,s-] it so?
There are some reason [np3,2-] .
When one want [vp3,1-] to finish something quickly he tends to do it in a hurry.
He can't consider all the aspects of it and it probably draw [vp3,2-] back the proceeding [wd3,3-] .
Another is that one in a hurry can't do well and, it maybe postpone [vp3,2-] the achievements.
There is an example that can vertify [fm1,-] the truth of "Haste makes waste" well.
A person wants to meet [wd3,s-] the train as quickly as he can.
He hurrys [fm2,-] out and gets to the station 15 miniturs [fm1,-] earlier.
Suddenly he finds he forget [vp3,1-] to take the suicase [fm1,-] that he must use.
So he has to return to take it, as makes him wait for the next train.
Doesn't it tell us that he didn't do it [pr1,s-] ?
Some people like to do everything quickly.
They believe that it is efficient to do everything quickly.
But I don't think so.
I believe haste makes waste.
For example, if you are doing your homework, Mother told [vp6,s-] you [wd4,s-] should finish your homework, and then you should [wd3,s-] go to play with your friends.
So you must do it quickly in order to play with your friends.
After several days, you will find many errors in your homework.
You can't help asking: "why?
I should haven't [vp9,1-] made these mistakes.
" It is eagerness makes you do them.
People can't do anything perfectly in eagerness [wd4,s-] even in anxiety.
Psyologists [fm1,-] also suggest eagerness don't [vp3,1-] mean good lucky [wd2,1-] .
So we should work regularly.
Because we can do everything better without the psyological [fm1,-] pressure.
In the history of socience [fm1,-] , many famous scientists discovered or invented scientific equation or something use [wd2,1-] .
They must spend several years or ten years.
None can do these in a day or in a night.
Haste makes waste, calmness makes use [wd7,2-] .
We say haste makes waste.
It is a useful idiom.
You know the things devolop [fm1,-] graduatedly [fm1,-] .
We doing anything; must obey the rule.
Haste can let the things run away [wd4,1-3] the usual route.
Not only can't obtain the gaol [fm1,-] .
But also bring the opposit [fm1,-] effect sometimes.
We can't change the normal rule of the nature, [wd4,s-] can't do our works unconsidering [fm2,-] the fact.
only [fm3,-] can you succeed obeying the natural's development regular [wd2,s-] .
We can say haste makes waste the following is some exampls [fm1,-] .
As a student [np3,-s] , we all have the experiment [wd3,s-] that, we study the lesson must have the spirit of graduatedly [fm1,-] , some student [np3,1-] have not the firm basement [wd3,s-] .
But they want to study the course beyond his [pr3,s-] level, as a result, his [pr3,s-] geting [fm1,-] can't compare [vp7,-1] with his [pr3,s-] lost [wd2,1-] .
Another [wd3,s-] , when we exercise our body farthermore [fm1,-] , we must obey the rule.
It is very important.
It often [ad1,-2] can be seen that someone is too eager to do things ahead [wd3,s-] , but they fail in the end.
Why does this happen?
There are some reason [np3,2-] .
Above all [wd4,s-] is that most of them haven't prepared well for their work.
Then when they meet some problem [np3,1-] , they don't know how to do.
Secondly, chance does not come frequently.
It's hard to succeed when chance hasn't come.
The [wd5,s-] third, Most [fm3,-] of the works need great patient [wd2,1-] .
If you want to haste [wd2,2-] , the chance of succeed [wd2,1-] will go.
So from [wd4,-1] above, we can see that haste makes waste.
It wastes not only time, but also energy and money.
To the peasents [fm1,-] , haste may be bad for their harvest.
The crops would die if they want them to grow too fast.
As for workers, if they proceed [cc3,-2] the production too fast, the production [wd2,-3] with bad quality would come out.
As students, we should haste [wd2,1-] in our study.
The knowledge can't be absorbed in a few days.
It needs years of hard work.
So we mustn't haste [wd2,1-] when we do anything.
But it is not equal to that we can slow down our speed because of lazy [wd2,1-] or other reasons.
We need to do well prepare [wd2,2-] and want for [wd5,s-] the chance.
When the chance comes, we shall work with patient [wd2,1-] .
Thus we can succeed and save our time, money and energy.
The Chinese idiom, haste makes waste, means that the willing [wd2,1-] to save time often results in a waste of time.
It orginates [fm1,-] from an old story.
Once there was a king who should return to his palace to deal with something in a short time.
Firstly he rided [fm2,-] a horse and kept spuring [fm1,-] it in order to get [wd4,s-] earlier.
But he was so anxious that he thought the horse run too slow [wd2,2-] .
Then he jumped down from the horse back [fm2,1-] and walked on foot.
The result is obvious that he wasted much time.
From this story we know: uder [fm1,-] some emergent circumstances in order to save time we easily become anxious and lose our sensiability [fm2,-] , we forget so many convention [np3,2-] that we can't give [wd3,-3] a right decision.
Haste makes us anxious and anxious [wd2,1-1] makes us unsensitible [fm2,-] which leads to a waste in the end.
We must keep a calm head [wd3,3-] under any circumstance.
Please rember [fm1,-] "Haste makes waste".
We all know the old saying, "Haste makes waste".
But why?
As we known [vp4,2-] , hurry comes along with haste.
 [wd7,s-] When you want to finish a thing as quickly as possible, you have little time to think over [vp1,1-3] how to do it efficiently, [wd4,s-] how to make full use of materials.
And you can't stop, thinking over what you have done, whether or not you are right, if you have another better way?
Without conclusion, it is hard to make progress furthermore.
What's more, haste makes you nervous, then all the things will [wd4,-2] in a mess and you can hardly decide how to go on.
In conclusion, we must know: Firstly, haster [fm2,-] makes waste of money and meterials [fm1,-] .
Second, haster [fm2,-] wastes your time, maybe you have to start again in a hurry.
Haster [fm2,-] always block [vp3,2-] you up.
The waster [wd2,1-1] made by haster [fm2,-] is easy to see.
I can make [wd3,-3] some examples from myself.
One day, I had to finish a model plane which was to be handed in next day.
I try [vp6,s-] my best to work as quickly as possible as to cut all its parts out from the template [wd7,s-] , then they are lying in front of me in a mess and I really do not know which one should I pick up firstly and how to begin!
What's a pity!
I waste [vp6,s-] all my time [wd4,-2] the day!
It's quitely [fm2,-] confirm [vp9,2-] the old saying: "Haste makes waste.
"
Everybody of us always hope that we finish our works spending the least time.
We try our best to look for the way to be most efficient.
Sometimes, we are benifited [fm1,-] by it, but most of times [np5,s-] , we fail and have to waste more time to start from the beginning again.
Just as the saying goes, haste makes waste.
Everything happens according to their own regulation.
So what we can do is just to follow the order [wd7,2-] .
As we all knows [np3,3-] , a man will be hurt on his [wd3,2-1] mouth if he is too eager to drinking [vp5,3-] the boiling water.
What's more, we know about the story of a man who wants his corn grow more higher through the way that he pull all his corn higher.
Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that haste makes waste.
How does [vp3,-1] we obey this priciple [fm1,-] ?
In our ordinary lives, we must grasp some scient [fm1,-] knowledges [np5,-] and then use them.
However, we must [vp9,-2] to work to make our lives more facilited [fm2,-] with more efficient way.
Most people can't keep calm before emergency.
When there is not enough time left, he(she) may lose temper or feel uncomfortable.
In this case, he does everything discarefully [fm2,-] , so that he would lose this or forget that.
Finally, everything seems to be out of order.
It is Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
But, it [pr1,s-] is the simple meaning, there is still further meaning in our lives.
You may get it in [wd3,2-3] my following example.
Once a building caught in fire.
Everybody in it rushed down the stairs and run to the only gate.
They each wanted to get out as quick [wd2,3-] as possible, and no one wanted to die.
So many people get [vp6,-s-] to the gate at the same time that they were stucked [fm2,-] in it and no one got out.
But suppose, [wd3,s-] one person stand out to make order.
Everyone standed [fm2,-] in line, may-be no one would [vp8,s-] die.
There are so many examples in our every day life.
I think, it [wd4,1-1] important for us to keep calm in this [pr1,s-] case.
It is well-known that haste makes waste.
This words [np3,1-] indicates that if you want to do something in a hurry, finish it earlier than before, you will get nothing at last.
For example, when I was 15-year-old [aj5,3-] , I was fond of football.
At a [wd3,s-] time, several friends asked me to play football when I was helping my mother to have [wd3,3-2] a cooking.
In order to play football as soon as I can, I hurried to wear my shoe and let the fire burning [vp5,3-] [cc5,-1] larger.
But some minutes later, I [cc2,-4] smelt of nasty [cc4,-1] gas.
Oh, my god!
The food had already turned bad.
And I was scolded by my mother.
So as you can see, when we do anything, we should do it slowly, not hurrily [fm2,-] .
Otherwise we could not get the consequence [wd3,s-] that we expect.
And sometimes it may turn worse.
So why we don't [wd1,s-] do it at leisure?
Haste make [vp3,1-] waste, because you haven't prepaired [fm1,-] everything you must have done.
It's [wd7,s-s-] ] the foundation.
When we start to do something, firstly we should do something [wd7,4-] : make a good plan, find something we need to use, and some people if we can't do it without their help, and so on.
When all is running [wd3,s-] , we just do it.
A [np7,-1] excession [fm1,-] is needed.
You can't make a jump from the start to the end.
Of course we all like haste.
 [wd7,s-] But there are many difficulties.
If we just run toward the success without anything, you'll make waste.
For example, a girl is fat and she want [vp3,1-] to be thinner and more beautiful.
What should she do.
Haste [wd2,s-] ?
She may get [wd3,-2] on diet or even eat nothing except water.
But what is the result?
She will be ill or even dead.
Whatever you think in your mind the body needs food.
 [wd7,s-] Otherwise it will be out of order.
Fat girl can be thinner.
She can make a good diet and carry it out.
At the same time she need [vp3,1-] phsical [fm1,-] training.
It is slower but good to her.
In all [pp2,-] , haste make [vp3,1-] waste.
Walking on the ground, [wd7,s-] we'll reach the success.
Don't fly because you might fall to the earth and die!
It is true that Haste [fm3,-] makes waste.
Haste means that you make decisions blindly and take action rashly.
Since considered decision is not involved in the whole process of dealing with problems, the result will not be a perfect one.
Furthermore, haste makes disaster sometimes.
We are very familiar to the situation that the students who are idling away their time daily cram for an examination.
Such students fail to plan their time carefully, in other words, they fail to make a considered decision on how to use their time daily.
Here we see haste make wastes.
They try their best but get zero in test [np6,1-] .
In society, we can see the people who are eager to find a cut-cross [wd3,s-] to great wealth in spite of the precept of "no pay, no gains [np2,3-] ".
Such people is [vp3,1-] so dangerous that they can finally commit any crime to attain their goal.
Here we see the fact that Haste [fm3,-] not only makes waste but also makes disasterous [fm1,-] damages to society.
Then comes the conclusion that haste really makes waste.
Haste can waste your belongings and even your reputation and life.
As we know, everything has its process.
We can't order a baby to run.
It only lead [vp3,2-] [vp1,-2] to fall.
Because he hasn't learned to walk yet.
Even if he has learned it, we can't order him to run immediately.
He needs time to learn it.
We ought to obey the rule when we do everything.
When we study, we shall do it step by step.
When we devolop [fm1,-] our country, we shall do it step by step.
There's a lesson [np1,s-] in history [np6,1-] that we tried to be too fast to devolop [fm1,-] our society.
Now we shall do it step by step.
Whenever and wherever [wd4,-s-] we shall remember it [pr2,-s-] : haste makes waste.
We often hear of haste makes waste.
Why?
Because anything has its style [wd7,3-] , once we break the style, we will can't succees [fm1,-] .
When we read book [np6,1-] , we want to learn more and more information,but there is a limit in our mind, the information reach [vp3,2-] [vp1,-3] to the limit, our mind will can't [vp9,1-] receive new information.
If you force youself [fm1,-] to receive new information again, you will make all of the information [cc2,1-2] give off from your mind.
You must know it, when you receive new information, you must think haste makes waste.
 [wd7,s-] 
Long, long ago, a man want [vp3,2-] to make a tree grow more fast [ad3,1-] , he drow [fm1,-] the tree to help it [pr1,s-] , but the tree "dies" .
Because he didn't know the tree growed [fm2,-] according to its style [wd7,3-] , he couldn't help it, at last he made the tree "die".
At [wd7,-s-] every doing live [wd2,3-] , there are a lot of example [np3,3-] , haste makes waste, we must warn of it.
Many people believe that haste makes waste.
Why?
We all know that any thing has its own developing principle.
After it is created, it develops step by step, and then reachs [fm1,-] the end.
Ignoring it, doing the thing according to our own expectation, lead us to failure.
Maybe, we make a good beginning, but we also think [vp1,-4] "be quick, be quick", so we became hasty and impatient, we forget the steps, we want to swallow an elephant at one time.
Thus we are doomed to be [wd5,s-] fail.
Father always tells me,"Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
I still remember the story that we learned in the primary school.
A hasty men [np3,2-] wanted his crop grow sooner [wd3,4-] , so he pulled them up.
Now [wd3,s-] , it seemed that the crop grew much taller, but the next day, they all died.
Can you see, haste makes waste.
Chinese people usually say, "Hasty man can not eat up a hot beancurd [fm1,-] .
" Step by step, you'll succeed in everything.
Haste makes Waste [fm3,-] .
Why do we say so?
The saying implies the relationship between speed and efficiency.
In order to do things better, we must consider not only speed but also efficiency, otherwise, our efforts ends in vain.
That is to say: Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
I understood the meaning in an unforgettable way.
It was a high school English exam.
The reading comprehension was very difficult because of many new words.
They were so troublesome that I didn't bother to guess or deduce their meanings.
So I skimmed the passage.
But after reading it several times.
I still had no idea about the passage.
As to the other three passages, it was the same situation.
When the exam time was due, I had to guess the answers of course.
I failed in the exam.
From the experience, I learn my lesson.
That is to do things rapidly and efficiently.
Emphasizing anyone [wd3,s-] and ignoring the other will be haste makes waste.
"Haste make [vp3,1-1] waste" tell [vp3,3-] us how to deal with [cc3,1-6] the situation and our wills.
People usually want to achieve their aim quickly but neglect the situation.
Situation has its regulation, we can't change it, we can't neglect it.
We must obey it and use it.
Only when what we are thing [fm1,-] about met the situation's quest [wd3,s-] , Our [fm3,-] wish can [wd1,s-] come into true.
If we disobey the regulation, we'll never succees [fm1,-] .
That's "Haste [fm3,-] makes waste".
For example, when we learn English, all of us want make [vp4,1-] a quick [wd4,s-] .
So we read, we write, we listen, we speak.
Every day we repeat them.
But sometime [wd3,s-] , we learn a lot as much as other people learn, [wd4,s-] it's ineffective.
That's why?
We neglected the regulation in English study.
We want the speed only lose the speed.
That's "Haste makes waste".
"Haste Makes Waste" is one of the most often spoken idioms.
Because it is the case in overwhelming majority [wd4,-1] situations.
With the development of the mordern [fm1,-] society, the tempo of our life become quicker and quicker, so we pay much attention to speed.
But not all things need only speed.
Even at times haste make [vp3,1-] waste.
For example, this idiom is very fitted [wd2,2-1] for our study.
To master knowledge well, we must practise step by step.
otherwise [fm3,-] , we can't reach the rich storehouse of the knowledge.
Beside forgoing [wd3,s-] , it can also be fitted [wd2,1-] for most of the aspects of our daily life.
Since then, [wd3,1-] we must make sense of the idiom "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" and bring [wd3,-4] it in our minds when we do something, especially important things.
Only by this, we can [wd1,s-] reach our purposes successfully.
What "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" means is that we won't succeed in anything [wd4,s-] we want to finish it too quickly.
The reason is that when we try to finish something too quickly, always [ad1,-2] we will not make the preparations which are necessarily needed, or not do it step by step, just to save the time.
And [wd5,s-] obviously the preparations and doing it step by step is all those that will lead to the success.
Learning English is a good example.
If we want to develope [fm1,-3] [cc3,-] our English degree, we can not hope to succeed in a shorp [fm1,-] period of time.
Because to develope [fm1,-] [cc3,-2] English degree is to have a large number of work for us to do.
We must add [wd3,-2] our vocabulary; we must do reading excises to improve our reading skill; we must make clear of [wd5,s-] all kinds of gramme [fm1,-] .
And all things can't be finished in a short time.
It's easy to see that if we want to finish these in a short time, however hard we worked [vp6,s-] , it would still be impossible for us to turn our will [wd3,2-2] into fact.
Chinese has a [np7,-1] old saying: Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste.
Why do we say that?
Because people think that whateven [fm1,-] we want to do, we must prepare it consvertinely [fm1,-] .
We might as well complete it by acting on its princepel [fm1,-] .
If we work without considering everything that we must [wd4,1-1] aware of we probably will come to falling down [wd7,3-] .
It means waste of thing.
 [wd7,s-] 
For example, we are cooking.
We wanna [fm1,-] complete it very soon, so we prepare the food very simply and cook them very hastely [fm2,-] .
We will most probably forget to drep [fm1,-] something else which must add [vp7,4-] up [wd5,1-2] to the food.
And we will probably cut short the time that we're cooking [vp6,s-] .
As a result we find we can eat nothing.
So, we must remmber [fm1,-] : Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste, We have [vp2,-3] better do everything by acting on its princepel [fm1,-] .
It is well known for us [wd5,1-] that "Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste".
Sometimes we want to get to someplace on time in a limited time, we are so hurry [wd2,2-] and anxious that [wd4,s-] forget to bring some important things with us.
When we get [wd4,-2] the destination we just find that we forget [vp6,s-] to bring the things we need.
For instance, you hurried into the classroom to attend an important exam, Perhaps you feel lucky that you use the shortest time from home or dormitory to the classroom and [wd4,s-] just before the exam begin.
But suddenly you find you forgot to bring your permission of examnation [fm1,-] .
Sometimes we want to get high score in the final exam and before the exam we worked [vp6,s-] very hard without thinking of our healthy [wd2,2-] .
When the date of exam come [vp3,4-] , we are so tired that we have no spirt [fm1,-] to do the problems.
Even [wd3,-1] worse, sometime [wd3,s-] we fail to attend the exam because we are ill caused by tired [wd2,1-] .
We never forget that in our recent history there was Great Promotion [wd3,1-] .
Perhaps the thought of progress [vp4,1-1] quickly is good, but we also should think about the envirenment [fm1,-] and capability, as well as other elements.
If we only seek the goal while [wd3,s-] ignore the very [ad2,-1] elements in process, we just put ourselves into such result [wd7,4-] -- Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste.
Sometimes we say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
It has fairly profound meaning.
Haste means acting quickly and waste means having [wd3,-2] no good, uselessness.
So how to comprehensive "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste"?
It just tells us that whatever we do, we should comply with the inherent principles of the matter and not go beyond even break the rules, or you will get nothing but the waste of time, metiral [fm1,-] or [wd5,1-1] etc.
For instance, a certain man want [vp3,3-] to buy a pair of shoes, some books and he also wants to repair his bike and then he want the [fm1,-] go fishing.
If he does arrange them in order, first to buy the book, then goes along street [np6,1-] to buy the shoes, then returns home for the fishing tools and the goes out for finishing, how could be [fm1,s-] manage all the three things together?
He will undoutably [fm1,-] does [vp9,2-] nothing that [wd5,s-] but [wd4,s-] busy going here and there.
Finally he will get himself tired.
Haste Makes [fm3,-1] Waste is a Chinese old saying.
Why does haste make waste?
First, if you are hasteful [fm2,-] to do something, you can't think it over and over.
Second, during the course of doing everything you might lose patience if you are hasteful [fm2,-] .
Finally, everything has its own rythmn [fm1,-] of development.
If you are hasteful [fm2,-] you'll break its rythmn [fm1,-] and make waste.
For example, in ancient China there was a peasant who owed [wd3,s-] a piece of field.
He was so hasteful [fm2,-] that he wanted his crops to grow quickly, so one day he went to the field and pulled all of his crops to make them seen [wd3,2-1] taller.
But, just as you know, all of his crops died immediately.
From this example we can see "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" this chinese [fm3,-] old saying .
Many people haven't paient [fm1,-] , they want to succeed immeditaly [fm1,-] .
They always think that the faster the better.
In fact, it is not true.
Haste makes waste.
Wehether [fm1,-] we work or study, we must have paient [fm1,-] .
Because, above all, we have to prepare everything well before we start, we must study it carefully, schelude [fm1,-] the process, and then, do it step by step.
If we want to succeed without doing anything, we will waste the time we spend in doing this thing.
 [wd7,s-] 
For example, study is a good case.
let me say something about myself.
One year before I dicided [fm1,-] to attend [wd4,s-] English corner, to improve my English level.
I thought that only if I attend [vp6,s-] , I would have what I wanted.
But in fact, I couldn't hear [wd3,s-] and say anything in the corner.
As a result, I wasted much time in [wd4,s-] English corner, but gained nothing.
And then, my teacher told me that "haste makes waste".
He adviced [wd2,1-] [vp1,-2] me prepare before going to [wd4,s-] English corner, speak and listen more in everyday life, improve English level little by little.
I did so.
And now, I can speak and listen freely in [wd4,s-] English corner.
In a word, haste makes waste.
If you want to succeed, "step by step" is the best way you should obey [cc3,s-] .
People often say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste!
" Why?
There are several reason [np3,2-] on [wd3,1-1] it.
First, when one wants to do something quickly, he can't think it over and arrange [vp1,-3] how to do it well.
So when he does it, he doesn't know what's the best means and how to do it effectiently [fm1,-] .
Second, when he does something rapidly he does it without thinking and is careless in doing it.
As a result, the faster he wants to do something, the worst [ad3,s-] the result is.
For instaince [fm1,-] , my uncle is a man who likes to do anything quickly.
But he often fails.
One time [wd3,1-] , he wanted to chang [fm1,-] the windows' glass in his house.
The seller asked him to bring them back twice because they broke easily.
But he didn't accept the advise [wd2,1-] .
He laid the pieces of glass after his bike.
As a result on his way home, the glass fell down and broke to pieces.
My friend is also a man like that.
Once he wanted to let a bottle of beer cool quickly so he put it into the refertior [fm1,-] .
After several minutes, the bottle broke and the refert [fm1,-] ... was useless too.
In a word, we do something we must think it over and do it careful [wd2,2-] .
Otherwise, we can't do it well.
Generally, people want to reach his object as fast as possible.
So he or she often take [vp3,-3] some methords [fm1,-] or measures without thinking carefully and completely.
As a result, they don't realize their object or gain what they want to have, even [wd4,s-] go to the opposite direction.
That is "haste makes waste".
For example, when we are studying at school, we want to gain a best score at [wd3,-1] test, so we often think [cc3,-3] some quick way to receive it.
Sometimes we will find some books, which we think of [wd5,s-] are avaibbe [fm1,-] to the tests, and read them more and more [wd3,2-1] carefully to hope we will guess the key of the questions on [wd3,-2] the test, and give up the basic knowledge which the teacher teaches us every day.
But at last we fall [wd3,s-] because we are too haste [wd2,2-] to sucess [fm1,-] .
To avoide [fm1,-] the shortcoming, we should try our best to make our doing more efficient [wd7,4-] .
"Haste makes waste.
" That's a famous Chinese saying.
Its means, that we should do everything step by step and with the correct method, otherwise, we'll labor in vain.
Here is an example, if we want to get [wd4,-2] some place in an unfamiliar city, what should we do first?
Go down the street and look for the place?
No, we should stay at some place for a while and study a map carefully, then, decide, where we should go.
In this way, we can get to our destination more quickly.
On the other hand, in our daily life, we should do everything from the start [wd2,1-1] point, and do it step by step.
When we want to do something, good prepairation [fm1,-] is necessary.
There, a house is on fire.
On seeing the smoke you rush towards it.
And then, what you can do is just standing anxiously, you have nothing to hold water.
What you have done is meaningles [fm1,-] .
So, it is wise to sharpen your knife [wd3,s-] first, then use it to cut the wood.
In this way we can do things efficiently.
There goes a well-known saying "Haste makes waste".
It means people sometimes disire [fm1,-] to do thing [np6,s-] quickly but finally find that it takes much more time than [wd4,s-] expected.
Why haste makes waste?
I think there are main reasons as [wd4,-1] following: Firstly, when people want to finish their work as soon as they can, they always ignore some details of the work.
When they start working, what was [vp6,s-] not expected happens, and they will not be able to solve the problem smoothly.
Secondly, when people work quickly they are likely to make more mistakes and perhaps some mistakes can not be corrected.
All these will take up much time.
For instance, suggest that you have only a little time to go to work.
You do not eat your breakfirst [fm1,-] at table but take it to your car.
Then you drive very fast to your office and sit down on your table.
When you begin to work you find your files are left at home.
It will take you more time to solve the problem.
We all say "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
but [fm3,-] why?
Don't you want to finish your work more quickly?
Don't you want to be successful more quickly?
Yes, we do.
But we must remember, whatever we do, we must do [vp1,2-3] step by step.
If you don't lay a good basis and do [vp1,s-3] step by step, you won't aim [cc3,-2] your goal.
So if you only want to be haste [wd2,1-] in your work, you will fail in the end.
So we say "Haste Makes Waste [fm3,2-] ".
Take [wd4,-2] for example.
We all want to be good at English.
But if you don't know enough words, you won't be successful.
You can't study English well in a few days.
You must study it step by step, and you must speak and study English a lot.
It will take you years before you are good [aj1,-1] it.
You must remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste" in study.
When we do things, we should take it in sequence [wd7,3-] .
Haste is harmful to us.
As the saying is "haste makes waste".
Why do peploe [fm1,-] say that haste makes waste?
First, when we are in haste, we can't keep clam [fm1,-] and think carefully.
That is a great obstacle to our success.
Second, everything has its own turn [wd7,4-] , we can not change it.
We can understand the saying from many relastic [fm1,-] examples.
If you want to make yourself strength [wd2,2] , you should do exercises often, have rest and eat well.
You can't wish to do it in one day.
The importance of it [pr1,s-] is that you should keep it [pr1,s-] constantly.
Educate [vp4,s-] a person is the same principle.
The change of a person's though [fm1,-] has a process.
In one [pp2,1-1] word, we should take things at [pp2,-1] turn.
We should remember that haste makes waste.
In order to complete some work on time and even in advance, we often do it as quickly as we can.
We think we could have time enough [wd1,2-] .
But why we always say haste makes waste?
Because sometimes we do something so quickly that we couldn't take care of them.
If we are careless, we'll do something wrong.
And when we correct the wrong [wd3,s-] , we spend more time on it than we do the thing a time [wd3,1-] .
I remember a thing that happened when I was ten years old.
One morning, when we would [wd4,-1] exam, I got up early and had breakfast quickly because I wanted to go to school earlier.
When I hurried [vp1,-2] out home, my mother told me to look through my bag and see whether [wd4,-2] left something.
But I hurried out [ad2,2-] and didn't do it.
Ten minutes later I came back because I left my pencil.
Taking the pencil I hurried out [ad2,2-] again.
But Ten minutes later I came back again because I left my rubber.
When I hurried to the school, the bell rang and the examination had begun.
After I want [wd3,s-] home and told mother [np6,1-] the thing, mother [np6,1-] said haste makes waste.
Why haste makes waste?
It seems [wd4,s-] a very simple question.
But to answer it correctly is not too easy.
When we are too eager to do one thing, more eager we are, less careful we will be.
To finish it in a short time, we have no time to examine the procedure, so always [ad1,-2] we fall [wd3,s-] .
Here is an example about "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
When studying English, a lot of students will make the same mistake.
The [fm1,-] are very eager to find a way that they can master this language quickly.
They may do a lot of exercises in one perial [fm1,-] .
And when they have lost insterst [fm1,-] in studying English the [fm1,-] push it aside.
When they are asked [wd4,s-] , they will say that it is difficult to study English.
But, they should know, anybody who learn [vp3,2-] English well depends on a kind of permenant [fm1,-] spirit.
They study English day by day, year by year, and never give it up.
And it is the reason that finally lead [vp3,s-] to their success.
So if you want to master a language, you should never make this [pr1,s-] mistake: Haste Maskes [fm1,-] Waste.
This example embodies the saying, Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
From the example.
I think you will answer the question on [pp2,-3] the head of the article.
Everything could be done in certain position.
 [wd7,s-] It's known to all that we can not count the chickens before [wd4,s-] hatched.
Some person [np3,1-] have not realized this theory.
They hurried [vp1,-2] in doing something in order to finish it as early as possible, without preparing [vp1,-4] with the basic requestions [fm1,-] .
Usually it leads to failure.
What you want can not be reached.
Even [wd3,-1] worse, it will be made in a mess.
Say , that is "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
"
For an [wd4,1-1] example, when you were driving a car, you drove it so fast that you can [vp6,s-] get home quickly.
There's a traffic-lights [fm2,1-] [np3,1-] ahead.
What would you do?
Surely, you could drive the car across the crossing without stopping through [fm1,-] the light was red.
Then the police would stop you, or sometimes you would catch an accident unluckly [fm1,-] .
Could you get home directly?
If every driver has the same opinion with [wd3,3-] yours, the city must be out of controll [fm1,-] .
There is a traffic jam everywhere, you can not get home quickly also.
So "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste".
Don't be aimless, you should do it step by step while you were [vp6,s-] doing something.
Haste makes waste is a [np7,-1] acient [fm1,-] idiom.
It is summary [np6,s-] of people's long experience.
Everything has its specially [wd2,-1] characteristic, according to [wd3,1-] it, you would get benefits from it, but if you exceed [wd3,s-] it, it would get badly to you [wd7,3-] , it would keep back your processor [wd3,3-] , so said haste makes waste .
Such as [wd3,s-] , when you have a chemistry experience [wd3,1-] , you should heat the tube slowly, if you heat the tube quickly, the tube's temperature raise quickly, it would crash, so you have to try another tube, so you finish the experience [wd3,2-] slowly.
That is haste makes waste.
So we do everything must accumulate, not to haste, so we can do the thing well.
We should learn to not [wd1,2-] haste [wd2,3-] , not to waste us [pr4,1-1] time.
Haste makes waste means we do things in a hurry for saving time, but in the end the result is not so satisfied [wd2,3-] .
Because when we finished [vp6,s-] a job in a hurry we [wd4,s-] often not so careful, not so accurate.
Therefore, we may easily do some thing wrong [wd2,4-] with it [wd5,s-] .
So we have to do it again or to do some repair [wd3,s-] work.
This idiom is widely uses [vp9,2-] in many aspects.
Usually it is used to tell someone to do things carefully don't think too much of the time, to do it well is better than [wd4,s-] do it again.
I have an example for this thing [wd5,s-] .
One day I wanted to get a good place in the classroom, because that night's lecture is [vp6,s-] very interesting, and the classroom is alway [fm1,-] harshed [fm2,-] .
So I picked up all the necessaries of the class and without checking [vp1,s-] up.
When I quickly passed the campus and finially [fm1,-] got a good seat I was very please [vp9,2-] about it.
But as soon as the teacher beggan [fm1,-] to speak, I suddenly found out that the text book was left [wd4,s-] .
So the whole night, I have [vp3,s-] to share the book with another classmate, and it really disturbed her, I feeled [fm2,-] regret [wd2,1-] but I have no choice.
Haste makes waste now I really knew.
There is a story about Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
Long long age [fm1,-] , a man wanted to go to the county, but the county door would be closed soon, and he have [vp6,s-] [vp3,1-] many books banded with rop [fm1,-] .
So he ask [vp6,s-] a man in [wd3,2-2] the way "Can I go into the county today?
" The man look [vp6,s-] up [wd4,2-1] him and said 'If you walk slowly, you can.
' The travier [fm1,-] was very happy, and he wanted to go into the county fastly [fm2,-] , so he walked fastly [fm2,-] .
But near the door [wd3,s-] the rop [fm1,-] broke, and the man had to stop to do [wd3,-3] with his books, when he finished doing [wd3,-2] with books, he found the door had be [vp9,1-1] closed.
This mean [vp3,1-] that if we want to do something, we shall do it [fm1,-] turn, if we want to do it fastly [fm1,-] and not in turn then will haste makes waste .
For example, some drivers wanted to go home early, so they drove fastly [fm2,-] , speeching [fm1,-] then a [np7,-1] accident happened, the drivers were injured, so they could not go home early, but waste [vp6,s-] many [np8,-1] time in hosplts [fm1,-] or he never come [vp3,2-] home again.
There is a famous Chinese saying "Haste makes waste.
" Some people are always trying to do things in a hasty way in order to save time.
But in fact, they often have to spend more time.
Why is [wd4,s-] the case?
Firstly, those people set out doing things without a plan.
Thus they don't know what important task should be finished at the beginning.
Secondly, they are anxious to save time, without a plan, so they can't get along step by step.
Furthermore, the result of their work won't be fine in such a hasty way.
Most things we do in our daily life proves [vp3,s-] the saying right.
For instance, when the Chinese teacher asks students to write a composition, many students begin writing without a plan.
Obviously, those students want to write an article quickly.
But without a well organized constructure [fm2,-] , the students especially beginners aren't able to write a precise, coherent composition.
If they make out a plan beforehand, they can have a clear thought.
After they start to write they are able to finish the composition quickly.
So remember "Haste Makes [fm3,1-1] Waste.
" Start with a good schedule.

If you want to built [vp5,1-] a big building, the fake material will make the building dangerous to mans' [fm2,-] life.

So the fake commodities are very harmful to the people.
How can we prevent these thing [np3,1-] from taking place?
I think, at first the factory which produce [vp3,s-] the good commodities [cc4,1-] should actively protect [cc3,-4] the advantage of themselves, then we can call on all the person [np3,2-] to object [wd2,s-] to use [wd2,3-] the fake commodities, the the [wd6,1-] fake commodities can not occupy the market .

Furthermore, fake commodities affect the flourish [wd2,-] of the economy.
Many factories that produce good [cc4,-1] commodites [fm1,-] are at a disadvantage because of their high price.
So, we must take great pains to prohibit fake commodities.
Firstly we should establish a good [cc4,-1] system of law.
Secondly, as a citzen [fm1,-] of the country, we shouldn't buy fake commdites [fm1,-] .
Fake commodities may be cheaper than good [cc4,-1] commodities but their quality is very poor.

There are full of commodities in the market, all kinds and all type [np6,1-] .
But there are also full of fake commodities in the market, all kinds and all type [np6,-] as the truth.
Why there are fake commodities?
Because some persons want to "get" more money, they can buy or "make" something with [pp1,-2] poor quality and pack them with a well-known factory's or company's name [wd3,-] and put them into market---- It's fake commodity .
Fake commodities do great harm to the economic [wd2,-] of the society and also to some of the well-known companies(in fact to all).
You can think people buy the fake commodities, find it's [fm2,-3] quality is poor, then they will not buy that kind of commodity at all .
And more [cj2,1-] , some commodities that can be eaten or driken [fm1,-] may do great harm to one's body [wd3,-] or kill him.
So, we must do something to [wd4,-] it, but how ?
I think there are three ways to kill [cc3,-1] it [pr1,s-] .
The [wd5,-] first, factories can make something which is not easy to buy or make, and tell people how to check it and the fake commodities will to "go into" market.
The [wd5,-] second, we can make some ruler [wd3,-] or law to beat [wd3,-] those who make fake commodities.
And the [wd5,-] last one [wd5,-] , you'd better go to those big markets to buy commodities, and then fake commodities will be fewer and fewer.
I'm sure someday in the future, there are [vp6,s-] commodities in our markets!

Although somebody think [vp3,1-] that the [wd5,s-] Fake [fm3,s-] Commodities [fm3,s-] is [vp3,3-1] useful, for example, they have lower price than [wd4,s-] the true commodities.
We should [vp9,s-] find out some dangers of Fake [fm3,s-] Commodities [fm3,s-] to us, first, they can endanger our health, sometimes they can kill the people .
For example the [wd5,s-] fake wine, fake food.

Above all, we can prevent the fake commodities from producing activity [cc4,1-] , the importance we can do is three ways .
First, we shouldn't buy the fake commodities.
Although they have a lower price.
Secondary [wd2,-] , if we find out the factory which is producing the fake commodities, we should tell about [wd5,-] the policeman.

Sometimes we are blamed by foreign countries for exporting fake commodities to them.
As a result, they will reduce or prevent [cc3,2-2] our product [wd2,-] they imported before.
Finally, fake commodities cause [wd3,-] our economy out of order.
When prociding [fm1,-] fake commodities can make a profit will anybody produce sound [cc4,-1] goods?
So we must do something to prevent fake commodities.
To manage it, we should first pass some laws which [cc2,2-1] identify fake commodities with penalty [wd7,s-] .

Even some big famous department stores are filled with fake commodities, which leads to terrible results.
For example, some people suffer from some diseases due to the fake medicines they bought from some humble shops.
Worse still, some were even dead because of that.
There was another case that a man's eyes were caused [wd3,-] blind because of the low [cc4,-1] quality lighter he got from the street seller.
Faced with such serious problem [np6,2-] , what can we do?
First, I think, every consumer must highen [fm2,-] their vigilance when they [pr3,s-] go shopping, we should never do business with those "small" sellers on the street.
It is much safer for us to go shopping in the big department, where the commodities are always guarateed [fm1,-] .
Second, [wd4,1-2] government should lay out [wd3,1-5] some laws to protect cosumer's [fm1,-] interest.
And some penalty should be done [cc3,4-] to those cheat in [wd3,-] fake commodities, without any mercy.

Finally, the government should pay more attention to knowing [cc3,-2] the question of fake commodities and make [wd3,-1] out some laws about the fake commodities.We believe that we can do well in permitting [wd3,s-] the fake commodities, so all of us must put the laws into actions [np6,s-] now.

It is true because of the following reason: First, when being in a [np5,-1] haste, you may not have enough time to do [cc3,-1] preparation.
It is hard to make things done sucessfully [fm1,-] when everything is not ready.
Second, when being in a [np5,-1] haste, you may not have a quiet and peaceful emotion.
Things might get to the bad side unreasonably.
Last, when being in a [np5,-1] haste, you may do things not necessary or not suitable for the situation.
Then lead things to an opposite way .
Take an example of children education here.
Many parents nowadays hope their children to be outstanding in the future.
So they make a lot of effects [wd3,-] , regardless [wd4,-] their children's needs.
They buy many reference books, have the children do many exericese [fm1,-] , some even send the children to various " pirate teachers".
All of these may do good in some ways, but children have normal education in school already, they have had enough exercises to do from their school teachers.
Meanwhile, They need time to play, to enjoy the nature, to make friends, to grow up as a social being ( ?"?).
What will happen if all their time is spend [fm1,-] in study?

 [vp4,-] It [pr2,-] 's still [ad1,-] time for sound sleep.
Pulled by a string tied between two beds in the room of 10 square meters, she got up.
Another new and difficult day coming, she dexterously cooked supper, served father, then hurried to school.
What has burdened such a little girl with a hard life?
Unlike other children enjoying comfortable living conditions and parents' love, she spent her childhood in tears: Suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, her father could only lie in bed; Mother mercilessly went away.
Since then, the heavy burden of life fell on the frail shoulders of the girl.
To cure the disease, they had sold all the valuable things except the small house.
Housework and attendance upon Father occupied most of her time after school.
She couldn't do her homework until it [pr2,-] 's deep into night.
She acted as an adult at home and a student at school, even nurse [np6,-] of her father.
In order to respond to father's demands of having medicine or injection as quickly as possible, she thought of a good idea, tie her ankle to father's bed with a string.
Each time father pulled the string, she could wake up and help him.
Seeing the string and the tiredness of daughter, Father often preferred enduring pain to pulling the string.
Recalling mother's leaving, the little girl felt painful.
After all, she's not at the age of becoming the only hope and support of the family, of tasting the bitterness and hardships of human life .
The misfortune, however, impelled her to grow up.
She demonstrated her strong character not only by hard work at home, but by perfect performance at school.
In teachers and students' eyes, she was a good student; although she had no new clothes, she was very clean.
While her companions walked between fruitshop [fm2,-] and toyshop, she paid much attention to those dustbins [wd7,-] to make money; while friends were happily [wd2,-] with father and mother, she lonely walked back home thinking of father's health.
As time went on, the Spring Festival was coming.
On the New Year's Eve, when firecrackers exploded outside, she sent father a gift, a paper which read [vp3,-] "Dear father: wish you happy new year and recover [vp5,-] soon.
" That was really a beautiful dream.
Day by day, the string was pulled over and over, the spirit [wd7,-] and the daughter kept on taking care of her father.
It is a life tied by string, not a common string, but a "dutiful daughter string" woven by daughter's sweat and true feelings.
My Heart Will Go On
Every night, in the same cafe, at the same table, the same boy appeared.
Each time, he ordered a cup of coffee.
Without adding any sugar, he drank it gradually.
He seemed to be waiting for somebody, who never came.
As ever before, Fei left dorm at 7:20.
On the way, two girls were talking as they were riding bikes in front of Fei.
At the intersection, suddenly another bike appeared like a wind, crashing into one of the two girls.
Without knowing what happened, the girl fell from the bike and hurt her ankle.
"Oh, sorry, but I will be late for class.
" The offender hurried away, without returning.
Seeing this, Fei stopped and came to the girl to asked whether she was OK.
Her ankle swelt, Fei decided to send her to the hospital.
The other girl followed.
Soon, news of Fei's good deed spread all over, but he was still himself.
One night, It rained when Fei was on his way back to the dorm, and he decided to drink something in the nearby cafe until it stopped raining.
He ordered a cup of coffee and then opened his book to save the time.
Suddenly, Fei felt someone standing in front of him.
"Hi, it's you," A girl's figure came into Fei's eyes as he raised his head.
Fei didn't remember who the girl was until the girl sat down opposite him and the waiter brought her a cup of juice.
"You were riding with another girl a few days ago, who was crashed into and whom I sent to the hospital.
You looked more worried than that girl did that day.
I remember you.
" "Yes, I really didn't know what to do at that very moment if it were not for your help.
Thank you.
" The girl smiled to Fei.
"Not at all.
" Silence kept for a while.
"Do you often read here with a cup of coffee in front of you?
" "No," Pointing out of the window, Fei continued, "It's raining.
" "Ha, we are on the same boat!
" The girl raised her voice.
Fei felt blushed, because never before was there such a pretty and lovely girl sitting with him.
Fei staring at his book, without the slightest move of his head.
"It's a good place here, romantic.
Oh, why don't you drink the coffee?
It's turning cold.
" Hearing this, Fei put down the book, took up the coffee cup and drank up quickly.
"It'll never turn cold," the girl added, "but don't you feel bitter when drinking.
You forgot to add sugar.
" "Really?
Oh, sorry, I was just thinking about a maths problem.
I was so absorbed that I forgot to ..." "But I have added some for you just now.
" "... " Fei grinned, He would pay anything he owned if he didn't say anything.
"Sorry, I just had a joke with you.
My name is Qi.
I think we can be friends.
" "My name is Fei and ..." "I know that and I also know you are in the Civil Engineering department.
" Qi interrupted him.
The rain stopped.
From then on, they were friends.
Qi often turned to Fei for help and being together with Qi, Fei felt happy.
He had a feeling, but never spoke it out.
Day after day, the graduation is coming.
Fei couldn't bear the feeling any more.
At last, in the same cafe, at the same table, Qi asked:" I 'll graduate from university tomorrow.
I feel excited.
And you?
" "I... Me, too.
" "You called me here just now when I was preparing for tomorrow.
What's the matter?
You seem unhappy.
" "No.
I just think, we've been friends for two years and I don't know if we will still be friends after graduation.
" "Sure, we will keep in touch however far we are.
" "I'd rather not let you be away from me.
So I can see you everyday.
" Fei stared at the coffee.
"Me, too.
But ... Don't worry.
I will keep you in my mind, my old friend.
" "I mean, I mean we can start ... our ... life.
You know I mean we are happy together and ..." Breathing deadened the cafe.
"Fei, I really thank you.
The last two years are the happiest time in my life that I spent together with you.
I look on you as my elder brother, a reliable brother.
I mean..." It rained.
"I don't want to hurt you...
I think you will attend the graduation ceremony tomorrow and enjoy my speech.
" With these words, Qi left the cafe and disappeared in the rain.
Fei sat there still.
The coffee, Without any sugar added, turned cold.
From then on, they never met, no touch between them.
Qi's figure often appeared in front of Fei.
In the dream, Fei murmured, "Qi, where are you?
I'm waiting for you in the cafe.

I was in great need of money.
I owned [wd3,-] Tyson, who was a ferocious usurer, $3000.
He had threatened me that if I could not return the money in two days, my ears would be the food of his little fish.
Hooligan as I was, I was ingenious.
I borrowed the money to buy necessary materials and do my little inventions.
 [cc3,-] Unfortunately few people appreciated my inventions and I got no money back.
So I was in debt of $3000.
How could I get such a large sum of money during a single day?
I had no expensive properties to sell.
All I had were my inventions.
But they could not sell [vp7,-] at a good price.
Maybe I should rob a bank.
'Yes, I will.
' Only in this way could I get so much money at once.
I had a gun.
I could use it.
After sticking some moustache on my face, I went out.
After observing several banks, I finally found a suitable one to 'do my job'.
It was not a very large one and few guards were patrolling there.
I went directly to a young service girl.
With a smile on face, she said 'good morning' to me.
But as I put the gun, wrapped in a piece of paper, on the counter, her smile froze.
'Give me $3000, quickly'.
I could feel my voice trembling.
The girl seemed a little calm after a few seconds.
Again smile on face, she asked, 'Would you like it to be in fifty or in ten?
' pretending that there was nothing unusual happening.
'Either will do, only if quickly'.
I was not patient.
I kept looking around.
Fortunately, no one noticed me.
The job was carried out smoothly.
For a third time, the girl was with a smile.
She warped her lips.
I followed subconsciously.
All at once, I found my moustache was loose.
I made it up in a hurry and urged in a low voice, 'Don't snicker, hurry up'.
Finally with a cunning smile on face, the girl passed me the money parcel.
I grabbed it and headed toward the gate.
I ran directly home.
As soon as I got home, I locked the door, panting out of breath.
When I calmed down, I unraveled the parcel to enjoy my harvest.
But to my great surprise, there was nothing but bunches of blank paper.
Oh, my ears, you were doomed to be the food of Tyson's little fish.
Here was no trace of enemy for the moment as far as eye can reach.
Everything fell into silence.
He, drained and depleted, just lay and watched in the trench.
His face was that of a student's with a pair of confused eyes.
Under the sky, the mountains stood still.
Beside him were the corpses of his companions and his own rifle.
He stretched himself out, changed the pose and faced the blue sky.
No, not blue, but gray, the dead gray.
The Sun was unsteady, panting and sighing.
Suddenly, something in the sky grasped his attention [cc3,-] .
It was the single cloud at this very moment, however, curiously shaped, hanging on the edge of the mountains.
He looked straightly at the cloud with wide-open eyes.
Against the strands of sunlight, the cloud exhibited itself brightly and splendidly.
Its color ranged from pure white to faint yellow, gold, orange, and even purple.
Suddenly the machine guns and rifles broke the silence of the dawn, like dogs barking on the lonely farms.
He reluctantly hauled his eyesight away and looked around.
There was no one in the eyeshot - the enemy was under cover.
He thought for a while, and then moved his eyes to the cloud again.
Now, it sank a little and converted itself into a more capricious shape.
He smiled and murmured to it in spite of the louder gunshots.
Suddenly, a bullet whistled past his ears just beside him.
He cursed and crawled away to the opposite.
However, he still gazed at the cloud, which was almost unseen, only leaving a small part tantalizing him.
Another machine gun ravaged the ground around him with a shower of bullets.
Finally, a bullet hit him mercilessly on the head.
He died immediately with a vestige of smile beside his mouth and the still opened eyes, fixing on the trace of the cloud.
Then it lay still, peacefully.
It was summer.
The air-conditioned compartment was stuffy.
People hustled about in the aisle, occasionally bumping into each other or murmuring something like "sorry", or "excuse me".
As the train started, those who traveled in groups began to chat or play cards.
Those who, like myself, traveled alone either tried to sleep or settled on a book.
I also decided to spend the whole night reading; one of the disadvantages of travelling overnight is that there is no chance to appreciate the landscape outside.
Unfortunately, I could not concentrate.
Maybe I needed a refreshing chat instead, I thought.
Yet around me was only a heated discussion about the stock market -- things that I was ignorant of.
Somehow the girl sitting opposite attracted my attention.
In simple white T-shirt and with a schoolbag, she was apparently a college student.
Contrary to the din around, she was immersed in her own book.
As she read intensively, an unconscious smile nestled in her crystal-like eyes, indicating hearty appreciation of the contents.
I then decided that I might enjoy talking to her; at least we both had a campus experience to share.
But how could I make a start?
I was, by nature, shy and passive.
I never [ad1,-] could initiate a conversation with enough confidence and tact.
Reluctantly, I gave up the thought.
Then the service boy on the train came along with tea and coffee.
I bought a cup of coffee to freshen myself up.
As I sat by the window, however, it was difficult to take the hot stuff back.
A stable hand offered timely help.
It was the girl opposite.
I thanked her, and then, nudged by something inside, added, "What are you reading about?
" At this [wd4,-] she handed me the book gracefully and replied, "It is one of my favorite: novels by contemporary Western writers.
Oh, by the way, I noticed that you are reading something on aesthetics.
May I have a look at the book, please?
" "Of course.
" Then, we exchanged the books and began talking about our reading habits.
The initial barrier between strangers was cast off; the chatterbox was opened.
Or indeed, it was a treasure box that was opened.
She was a student of Chinese Literature and I had always cherished an interest [cc3,-] in novels and poems; our topics were abundant.
I listened to her recommendation of masters' works, remarks on contemporary writers and admiration for her favorite books and authors.
She, in return, got to know my perspective of literary works as an outsider, one whose view is profoundly influenced by "the scientific way of thinking".
This extensive exchange of ideas and thoughts was really wonderful: focuses of the discussions shifted quickly and randomly; new thoughts inspired the mind [cc3,-] constantly.
Like floods rushing over barren land, the hearty conversation nourished an otherwise lonely night.
Time flashed by.
It was soon dawning.
When the first beam of sunlight gilded the tiny tables and soft couches inside, most of the passengers were still fast asleep.
We were both staying awake for a whole night, yet it felt like dreaming in a sense.
Hours ago we were mere strangers: two individuals that happened to board on the same train.
Minutes later we would bid each other farewell, as old friends.
We could have passed by without knowing each other, were it not for the girl's helping hand, reaching out further beyond necessity,and for my rather abrupt question, bumping slightly out of the sphere of conventionality.
Yes, sometimes friendship could be so easy [wd7,-] , if one takes the initiative.
People who have lived an urban life for a long time will find it, sooner or later, a little bit banal.
That is why my friends and I decided to make an adventure in the wild.
When we put our tents, sleeping bags and food into the waterproof packs, we could not refrain the jollity and no one had expected the danger ahead.
Several guides led us into the mountain, and soon became disappointed with our incompetence to walk.
Now and then, here and there, there was someone tumbling into the water, or someone skidding [wd3,-] down the rock.
When we arrived at the cataract, it was gloaming, almost two hours later than the guides had planned.
Pain and fatigue, however, made us too exhausted to think of its serious consequences.
We had to surmount the cliff beside the cataract.
I was dumbfounded by the perpendicular of the crag.
There were four shallow concaves on its surface, which was [vp3,-] the only way we could and must take.
The guides demonstrated for [vp2,-] us how to pass it, and gave us some instructions.
In order to save time, they didn't let us wear safe-belt [wd2,-] , but just pull a rope across the surface of the crag, with its two ends tied on the trees, which was probably a fatal mistake.
It was my turn and I plucked up to climb close to it.
Like the guide, I first put my fingers into the crevice and one foot into the first concave.
Then I cautiously moved the other foot into the same concave and freed the former one to reach the next.
Soon the tension in my legs caused me to tremble, and the tremble caused my fear.
Precarious on the crag, I was unable to move on.
I was soon aware that my strength would run out if no further steps were taken.
So I made a jerk towards the third concave, which cost my balance.
My foot slid from the concave terribly, and I was falling to death.
Just a split of second, finding I was still alive, my heart resumed beating.
The rope below somehow supported me between my waist and the pack and I was pendulous in the air!
Night came and appeared grisly.
Above me was the darkening sky and some noised [wd2,-] while below me was the sepulchral abyss and absolute silence.
The chilly mountain breeze kept me sober, informing me that I was in the palm of the god [fm3,-] .
Time seemed frozen until I heard someone asking for my hand.
I followed him and felt pulled upward.
The feeling of death was so marvelous that it exorcised all the dread in my heart.
The desire for life was so strong that I exerted the rest of my strength to tug up.
I was helped to touch the crevice and concave again, and I managed to surmount the last concave and joined my friend in tears.
After that moment, all the hardness ahead became nothing to me.
Wading in the water, plodding on the gravel -- all was nothing.
The feeling of death had become an impetus to me.
Even now, having returned to the urban life, that feeling remains intact in my memory.
I don't take it as a nightmare, but rather a nice dream, reminding me the significance of life and endowing me with strength to strive out of every predicament.
When I was in high school, I was in the advanced class.
Famous for our naughtiness and haughtiness, the class was nicknamed 'the Devil Club'.
However, the name made us feel different and we always enjoyed being the little devils of the school.
But maybe Mr. Felton had made an exception.
Mr. Felton was our physics teacher in Senior 2.
He was a man of 40 and always smiling.
But soon we found that his teaching was very poor: what he taught was either simple or wrong.
Many of my classmates expressed their discontent to Ms. Stewart, who was in charge of our class, but the reply was always the same: we were just not adapted to Felton's way of teaching.
However, the more I tried to enjoy his lessons, the more I felt him a nuisance.
Even his smiling looked silly and disgusting.
Greatly annoyed, Mark and I wrote articles about it and sent one copy to the Principal.
We even had a talk with his eminence yet without any effect.
Disappointed and irritated, we knew what the last thing we could do was.
With the thought of revenge, we welcomed the annual poll on teachers' teaching qualities.
Most of us marked Felton with 'D' (the worst level) in every item.
We even instigated many students in other classes to give him a poor grading.
Only by this means, we thought, could we express our dissatisfaction.
As the new semester of Senior 3 was coming, we prayed day by day to have a new physics teacher so as to get rid of Felton.
Yet far beyond my expectation, I was told that he was fired!
I felt a bit sorry for him.
Had he not been assigned to the advanced class, had he not met such devils as we were, such things would never have happened.
A year later, news came that he had got cerebral haemorrhage and become paralyzed.
It was too late to say we didn't mean it.
But maybe after such experience, we could know how to treat people even when they were wrong.

Patriotism  Patriotism means the love of one's country.
It makes one ready to sacrifice his life for his country, and to do many other deeds which can bring benefits to his people.
It makes a country strong and her history glorious.
It also improves a man's character and secures for him widespread fame.
To love our country means the fulfilment of one's [pr1,8-] duty and obligations.
To maintain the stability and unity of our country, one [pr1,9-] should work hard so as to make her strong and rich, support her government, obey her laws, pay taxes -- this is to be a real Chinese patriot.
If the people of a country are not patriotic, the country must be very weak.
History tells us how some countries of ancient times were, owing to lack of patriotism, conquered by other peoples and how the people of the conquered countries were made slaves under the yoke of thier [fm1,-] victorious masters.
English Department Sydney University Sydney Australia Foreign Languages Institute Guangzhou China Dear Sir, I am most delighted to have been offered the appointment for he period beginning from 1 February, 1997 to 31 January, 1999.
I am most willing to accept your kind offer.
However, as I am now doing some translation and compilation work in London, I am afraid that the work will not be finished until August, 1997. therefore, I would like to suggest that the appointment be made from 1 September.
1997 to 31 August, 1999.
Thank you very much for your offer.
I sincerely hope that my work in London will be of great benefit to the Institute in any teaching, translation, interpretation, or compilation work I may be called upon to do.
I look forward to your early reply.
Yours sincerely,                 Robert Lee
< ST 5><SEX 1><Y 8><SCH Zhongda><AGE 20><WAY 1><DIC ><TYP 1>         Patriotism  Patriotism, a kind of feeling, shows [cc2,5-5] one's love to his nation.
A patriotic person will do anything for his motherland, even to die.
In the history of our nation, there are numerous patriotic persons, such as Yuefei, Zhen cheng gong and Li zhe qu.
The general meaning of patriotism is the same, however, the definition of it in different eras varies.
In acient [fm1,-] China, the definition of patriotism was to devote oneself to the emperor and to the fudal [fm1,-] society.
You can compare what Yuefei had done with what Li zhe qu had done.
Even though they fought against the foreign invaders and they defended our nation, their aim was to maintain the fudal [fm1,-] society.
On the other hand, the patriotism of the revolutionary period is quite different.
The patriotic persons armed themselves and fought against foreign invaders, strifing [wd2,-4] with the antirevolutionary army.
What they have done was to liberate the working class, to liberate our whole nation, not for a man, but for every Chinese.
The definition of patriotism had been developed and advanced.
Now we've been [vp6,2-7] in the new era of socialist construction, therefore the definition of patriotism is different from others.
To make our country better and stronger is the exact definition of patriotism at [pp2,-2] present time.
teracota [fm1,-] is very famous and has attracted many travellers all over the world.
Guilin's waters and mountain also help the city to make a lot of money.
That's to say, the income of the tourist cites depends on tourism.
Most of the cities I've even [fm1,-] visited are developing cities, such as Jiangmen and Huizhou.
They can hardly give you any impression because they themselves have few features.
Anyway, they're devoloping [fm1,-] so fast that we couldn't look down upon them.
Huizhou, the little city in Guang dong [fm2,-] , now has attracted many foreign funds capital funded enterprices.
All these are the cities [wd4,-s] have visited in China.
I hope that some day I can have chances to visit cities in the west [fm3,-] .
I've been to Zhong shan [fm2,-] University for several times.
When I contrasted it with GUFL, which I'm now studying at, it showed a great difference.
At [pp2,-1] all, zhong [fm3,-] shan [fm2,-] Univerdity gave you a more comfortable feeling than GUFL did.
In order to identify it completely we can try to make contrast about their fame, area, environment, teaching facilities and entertaining facilities.
No doubt, Zhong shan [fm2,-] University enjoys much greater fame than GUFL does.
It's one of the most famous universities in south China, even a foreign [wd2,1-2] knows it and shows great interest when mentioning it.
I'm sure that GUFL couldn't be so attractive .
some [fm3,-] people in Guang zhou [fm2,-] haven't heard of the name of GUFL before and some know, but they don't know where to find it.
On the contrary, you can easily find Zhong shan [fm2,-] University in Xingang Road.
In [wd4,-s] area, GUFL is apparently much smaller than ZU.
We don't have to know the exact number.
You can just traveral [fm1,-] around the two niversities [fm1,-] and contrast the time you use.
Definitely it costs [cc3,-5] you much time to traveral [fm1,-] the whole ZU, while [wd4,-5] GUFL, quite a little time.
We can find that half of the area in GUFL is covered by teachers' buildings.
That's quite different from the situation of ZU.
With the help of Baiyun Hill, GUFL provides a beautiful scene to s --- trees and flowers are seen all around.
But that's pure natural scene, not live [wd7,-] the scenes at ZU, such as the man-made lakes, which are very beautiful and clean.
ZU does better in the pretection [fm1,-] of environment.
The roads in ZU are usually kept tidy, while we can often see dust on the roads in GUFL.
definitely [fm3,-] it needs improvement on the hand [wd7,2-] .
The main reason why ZU can enjoy a good fame comes from its perfect teaching and entertaining facilities.
Its library is the largest of all university libraries in Guangdong.
Ying dong [fm2,-] studuim [fm1,-] [fm3,-] , which was built with Mr. Huo Ying dong [fm2, -] 's funds is also the most attractive and practical one in Guangdong.
When turning back to GUFL's poor library and its football field, which is overed by high grass, we have to shake our heads with pity!
We annot [fm1,-] even find a good playground here in GUFL to hold a sportsmeet!
In general, ZU provides a more comfortable situation to its studens [fm1,-] , and GUFL, still needs many improvements.
A Friend is a person who shares the same feelings of natural liking and understanding, the same interests, etc.
It can be divided into two: close friends and common friends.
A close riend [fm1,-] can share many thoughts with you, even his/her ecrets [fm1,-] .
In addition, they have the same or similar feeling on sth [fm1,-] .
When your friend was sad or uncomfortable, you had no reason to be happy man.
You should feel sad or uncomfortable too and more or ss [fm1,-] , release your friend's sadness.
But that's impossible for a common friend to do--- they even don't know when you're sad and hen you're happy.
They just past [wd2,2-2] their greetings while meeting with you.
That's quite different from what a close friend shows.
In addition, you see a friend more regularly or often than some one [fm2,-] else, so that you have more time to exchange your feelings and you [pr4,5-3] points of view, especially when you are close friends.
so [fm3,-] people we also can meet regularly or quite often, but they might not be our friends.
For example, we meet some of our teachers almost everyday, but not all of them can be our friends.
Sometimes we even hate them.
In this case we meet to have classes, not for the purpose of making friends.
"A friend in need is a friend indeed.
" Those who cannot help you solve your problems aren't called " A FRIEND.
" A real friend will try his best to help you --- this kind of help is based on faithfulness, not on money or some other benefits.
Generally, a friend will always support you and fight with the difficulties and your opponents together with you.
But if necessary, he will fairly point out your mistakes to help you improve and make more progress.
A real good friend can share bed with you without fearing that you will kill or hurt him at the [wd5,3-1] midnight.
One day I chatted with my close friend Denise in the institute.
We sat side by side on a bench.
Suddenly, she cried in joy " Look!
Cat!
" Then a loudly [fm1,-] yellow cat with brown stripes on its body was seem [wd3,-s] jumping down from the roof of a store beside us.
" How fat and lovely it is!
" Denise said, with her eyes twinkling.
" Yes," I was surprised " Do you like cats too?
" I thought that normally girls would like dogs better than cats.
" Certainly, I loved them when I was still a little girl.
We even fed a cat which resembles [vp6,-s] that cat in appearance at that time, so that [wd5,s-] it recalled [wd3,-s] me of my cat when I saw that cat just now.
" She became more and more excited.
" I know.
But you haven't concerned [wd3,-s] about your cat before.
How is it now?
" She turned her face and said in sadness: " She has been dead.
" " I'm sorry ... Because of illness?
" I asked.
" Maybe, She didn't eat anything although I fed her with much delicious food.
And we had to see her growing thiner [fm1,-] and thiner [fm1,-] .
Later, she got dead.
" Denise said in a nearly trembly [wd2,3-1] voice.
I know the mood that she was in.
" So that you even didn't knew [vp9,3-] hat she died of, right?
" Denise slightly nodded her head.
" She has gone.
" I noticed that she was staring at the cat which had the similar appearance of hers, and now ran away.
No doubt, she was referring to it.
" It's a pity that we don't wave [wd3,-s] veterinnarians [fm1,-] here.
" I continued.
" Yes.
And I wish I were, but.
.." she stopped and sighed.
" Life is life.
There is something we cannot espect [fm1,-] ," I was trying to comfort her.
" I asked [wd3,-s] to feed 4 cats altogether [wd3,-s] .
I loved them more and more, and, spent most of my spare time playing with them.But they were lost or killed by others.
I hate the people who treat my cats so cruel [wd2,6-] !
You seem to be comparatively lucky, right?
" " Yes," Denise sighed again and said.
" Why can't the animals be treated as equally as us human-beings?
" " Ha ha.
" I laughed, " That seems not possible yet.
But let's wish that some day in the future it will come true.
Well, I have something to do now.
See you next time.
" " See you".
Then we left.
Describing A Person: When the sun was shining in the middle of the sky .
Gary looper [fm3,-] , an American cop, appeared on the street again.
Under the yellowish setting of the late nineteen [np9,2-1] century constructions, his black uniform was very eye-catching.
The shing [fm1,-] silver medal was hung on the left of his waiste-coat [fm1,-] , indicating his identity.
Now and then he put his right hand upon the pistol tied on the belt.
The gun was so heavy together with big hand that the belt sloped to the right a little.
But at the moment he seemed totally unaware of the weight on his waist, heading to the police office.
Under the smart velvet hat was his clear- cut feature: keen eyes, dark eye brows, straight nose and the firm and dignified jaw.
His age was not a secret, for everal [fm1,-] white hair behind his ears and the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes revealed it.
he looked serious.
His eyebrow frowned and his mouth tightly shut.
He had a well-built figure and a straight back, from which one could conclude he had used to be a handsome young man and popular among the community.
Even though today his youth had faded with years, his popularity remained, not because of his apperance but because of his trust-worthiness.
His pace was always steady and his hands mere [fm1,-] always powerfully moving with rythmn [fm1,-] while he walked.
His typical walking style had been so will-known [fm1,-] that whenever the residents spoted [fm2,-] a man with long leg walking in this way, even 50 feet away, they could assume that: Gary Cooper was coming.
Nov. 8th.
An early morning, a father with his two little girls has arrived at the gate of the hospital, waiting to visit his wife who has just given birth to a boy.
It is still early; the locked iron with wire screen looks like a stern guard, resolved o separate the hospital and the outside world.
A scarlet number 27 is printed on the wall, contrasting the grey pavement.
In the chill [wd2,2-1] breeze, the thickly-dressed family are all looking inside the hospital earnestly.
A lovely girl, about two years old, is sitting on his father's shoulders.
Her chabby [fm1,-] face is resting comfortably on her father's head.
Her little hands are dragging the collar of her father's flannel overcoat.
The father, like his little girls, looks wistful, firmly holding the girls little leg, with his sinecry big hands.
Another little irl [fm1,-] is in red otted [fm1,-] blouse and short- skirt.
Her hair looks like a mess of cabbage.
Her hands are grasping the cold iron bar; it seems as if she wanted to squeeze her little head through the gate.
Prossibly [fm1,-] lack of the mother's care, they all look casually dressed, especially ten [wd7,-s] father--- his mudelled [fm1,-] hair, his flare trousers creased, his shoes dusty.
Describing What People Do I am one of those who are never able to sleep like a log, so I can tell exactly at what time the lights are turned on every morning.
The biological clock in my body works so well that by the time the lights are on, that is at six o'clock, I have been turning over on the bed, fully aware the light will be on at any time in the next fifteen minutes.
When jthe [fm1,-] light turns on, I first try to hide in the shadow of the musquito-net [fm1,-] , shunning the sudden bright light.
But soon I find the white light just keeps peneatrating [fm1,-] my eye-lids; I suddenly opened my eyes, face the luminous ray, deeply inhaled the cool air and rise up.
Putting aside the warm quilt, I get out of the bed [wd4,-s] begin to put an [fm1,-] the clothes on the chair, which I have usually prepared the last [wd3,-s] night.
At about 6:20, dressed, I take cup, tooth-brush, ooth-paste [fm1,-] , towel and basin to the washing-room.
Usually at this moment most girls are still struggling on their beds to get up, so I am always the first one to get there.
The process usually begins with the meticulous teeth-brushing [fm1,-] , because having suffered from some teeth disease, I am very conscious of teeth hygiene.
Ten minutes later, going back to any room, I take out some necessary instruments and sterilizing liquid to wash my content-lens [fm1,-] .
This requires even more meticulation [fm1,-] .
I first remove the lid from the sterilized bottle, take out the fragile lenses and put them on my left palm.
Then pour several drops of sterilizing liquid on them and use my right forefinger to gently rub the lenses.
When they are dried up, I carefully put them into my eyes, as if I was holding a precious diamond on my finger-tips.
During this time, my breakfast, a cup of yogurt sent [vp7,4-3] onto my table; the loud speaker [fm2,-] outside is broadcasting the news on central [fm3,-] People's Broadcasting station [fm3,-] .
At 6:45, I quickly comb my hair, pick up the necessary materials for the corses [fm1,-] on that day and go out for morning reading at 7 o'clock.
The above is just what I usually do in the morning of Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
For the nest [fm1,-] weekdays when morning exercises is required, that is another story.

Sear [wd3,-1] Dicle, I'm really very sorry to say that I feel quite uncomfortable because of the noises from you everyday.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, your radio is broadcasting "the hijack in china [fm3,-] " and " riots in Los ngelos [fm1,-] ", while I am still is bed, spending the next tormenting 2 hours.
At lunch time, when I [wd4,1-4] sitting at the table, ready to enjoy my favorite " roast duck" ,the roaring and never-ending cry of Jimmy, your little son, comes to my ears and makes me sit at the table, without appetite.
After lunch when I am in bed again for a nap, your little Mary(is it?
) is hammering on the floor, giving me another 2 tomenting hours.
In the evening I have to put 2 cotton balls into my ears before I start to read my favorite book" Gone with the Wind", because the disco music from upstairs is not only shocking [wd3,-3] my whole room,but also my head.
And I have to stay up till 2' clock in the morning, waiting for the music to stop.
You know, I havn't got enough money to buy a new flat and I rally don't want to break down at this age.
I hope you will understand me and help me.
Truely [fm1,-] [wd4,-s] ,               Chen.
Classes I have Attended  There are two kinds of classes I have attended: Useful and useless.
No matter they are useful or useless, I have to attend them throughout the terms.
Almost [wd4,-s] of the classes I have attended are very useful.
I am very interested in these classes and pay great attention to them.
I come to these classes 5 minutes before the class begin and eave them 10 minutes after the classes are over, asking questions to the teachers.
During the classes, I take down every word of the teacher.
I have my eyes on the teachers throughout the classes.
I have never missed any homework of these classes.
In these classes ,I learn how to write an English address for my neighbour, I learn how to talk with a foreigner on the train.
The rest of the classes I have attended are completely useless.
I have never been in time for these classes.
More often than not , I leave these classes 15 minutes before the teachers leave.
During these classes, I either play my " game boy", or make plans for inviting my girlfriend, Mimy, to Kara OK.
I neither listen to the teachers nor take notes.
I even do not known [vp9,4-3] the teachers 'names when the school year comes to an end.
Actually, I got nothing from these classes.
These are the classes I have attended, I hope all the classes I attend will be useful in the future.
Shi Zui Xian and Yun Bei Beside the north gate of GIFL, there are two Da-pai-dangs , One is called Shi Zui Xian, the other is called Yun Bei.
I often go to ShiZui Xian for dinner, but seldom go to Yun Bei because the enviroment [fm1,-] of Shi Xui Xian is much better than that of Yun Bei.
Behind ShiZuiXian, there are green fields while [fm1,-] make people feel comfortable, while behind YuBei, there is a stinking ditch which makes on [fm1,-] lose appetite at once.
The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are well ventilated and very bright, while those of Yun Bei are not.
The rooms of Shi Zui Xian are also more spacious than those of Yun Bei.
It is very quiet in Shi Zhi Xian,nevertheless It [fm3,-] is very noisy in Yun Bei.
As She xui [fm3,-] Xian is much farther to the highway than Yun Bei, the air in shixui [fm3,-] Xian is much cleanner [fm2,-] and clearer than that of Yun Bei.
So, I really think that Shi Zui Xian is a much better place for dinner than Yun Bei.
CECL is a now [wd3,1-1] approach developed by GIFL for Chinese learners of English to develop their communication ability.
This class usually consists of listening, reading, talking, writing activities, So you need to get your textbook, vacaburary [fm1,-] list, earphone, pen and of course, your partner ready before attending your class.
First of all, you should preview the vocaburary [fm1,-] list because there's no time for you to learn the new words in class.
The class usually begins by doing some listening activitis [fm2,-] .
This time you just listen to the tape played by the teacher and do the exercises in the book.
.
After that, you should be prepared to answer the teacher's questions.
Then omes [fm1,-] the reading activity, which is usually some fast-reading materials, Again, year [wd3,-8] will have to do a lot of exercises, such as summary of a text, gap-filling, comprehensive questions.
What follows reading is usually the writing task, you are often required to write a short paragraph or something else , The most interesting thing of the class is the talking activity, in which the class usually ends.
In this activity, you should form either in pairs, or in groups, The topics are usually given in the book.
Sometimes you have debates besides discussions with your classmates.
Quite often you will finish your class in great exhaustion and of course, you will learn a lot in this class.
Boredom Boredom is the feeling that one has when he has too much to do or has nothing to do.
When a person has too much of something, he will certainly have the feeling of boredom, no matter how interesting the thing he first feel is, when there is othing [fm1,-] for one to do, this same feeling will certainly come up.
For a student, this feeling appears always [ad1,3-] when the [fm1,-] hurrying [vp4,2-2] [wd3,-2] the homework; for a husband, this feeling appears always [ad1,3-] when his wife prepares the same dish for him, or wears the same pajamas, for a lover, maybe when he or she always receives flowers from the same person .
Actually, No [fm3,-] one in this world that doesn't have boredom .
Everyone is complaining about boredom and trying to get rid of it.
However every day [fm2,-] everyone is creating new boredom if he his [fm1,-] succeeded [vp1,-2] to abandon the old-which is not often the case.
Boredom results from all kinds of things, from doing homework, from travelling on business, from greeting [vp1,-1] to people, or even from drinking beer--which is longed for by most of people.
Boredom is something of great varities [fm1,-] , which no ne an escape from.
I waited and waited at the busstop for a No 10 Bus.
"Excuse me.
" Suddly [fm1,-] a voice came from behind.
I looked back and found a man of Middle [fm1,-] age looking anxiously at me.
"Well", he said even more anxiously, "Could you tell me how I can get to Jiang Cun?
" I was quite familiar with that place, and pointing to the board of the bus stop, I said " Bus No.
36 will take you right there.
" And I turned back from him to see whether my bus was coming.
"Bus No 3?
" he said again, pulling my shirt.
"And how much does the ticket cost?
" " 40 Fen, " very impationatly [fm1,-] I said to him.
" Oh, 40 fen," he said, seemingly even more anxiously.
" Well, could you please give me 40 fen for the ticket ?
" " Why?
" I became a little bit angry.
" I'm very sorry " he said, putting his bag in front of me.
" You see, my bag was cut by a theif [fm1,-] and the thief left me nothing.
I just want 40 fen to return home.
" This time my anger disappeared and groped in my wallet for 40 fen.
However, I could not find the small changes.
" I'm very sorry, I really have no small change and the smallest note is 10 Yuan.
" No sooner than I had finished saying, he said happily, "Ok, I can give you the change of 9.6 yuan !
" I said nothing.

A meal I saw a table with many things on it in the sitting room when I was opening [vp6,-s] the door.
I was sure my mother had prepared supper for my father and I .
This was a round shaped and black table with four legs.
There were three, white chairs which were folding were [wd5,0-4] put white folding chairs were put around the table.
And then, on the table, there was a vase which was made of glass in the centre of the table.
Around the vase, there were two later [wd7,3-9] and one soup bowl were [wd5,-s] placed in good order.
You can [vp6,-s] see a deep fried fish in the plate, another plate with some oil white vegetables in it, and the the [wd6,1-1] soup bowl was foul [fm1,-] of sour and spicy soup .
All that seemed like [wd5,3-2] very delicious.
And then three small bowls with [wd5,3-3] full of rice were placed around the plates and the soup bowl.
Each bowl was occupied [vp7,3-5] one third of the table area and near the table --edge.
On the right of each bowl.
There was a pair of chocksticks [fm1,-] which was red.
I saw my father sat [vp4,4-3] on one chair, He looked like watermouth [fm2,-] eager for the meal.

On the top of this poster where [,-s] read "The pause that keeps you going " These two posters are cut carefully.
Waiting On one old [cc4,1-1] morning in the winter .
A man and his two little daughters are standing in front of a gate which is made of iron.
The man wearing a black windcoat [fm2,-] and blue jeans has brown curls.
From his wrinkly hand and rough profile.
I can say he is a blue-collar worker.
The little daughter sitting on his [pr3,5-2] father 's shoulder is two.
Years old .
She is wearing a white coat which is furry.
Her white hair looks a little rumpler [fm2,-] .
She is sitting comfortably.
Her father is holding her tight [cc4,-1] leg.
Another little girl with white culls [wd7,5-] wearing a flowered long wind coat [fm2,-] and a short skirt is four years old.
She is standing beside her father, putting her hands into her pockets.
They look a little sad and very tired.
May be [fm2,-] They [fm3,-] have walked a long way and came here to find their mother.
Because the man had a quarrel with his wife about a trivial matter yesterday.
So his wife left home and went to her count's [fm1,-] family on impulse.
This room No.

They got up very early this morning and came here for apology.
They are looking through the gates eagerly and waiting for someone to open the locked door.
I do hope his wife will forgive him.
In the morning I usually get up at 6: 30 .The broadcast [wd2,1-1] station of our campus wakes me up every morning.
The first thing I do is to make my bed.
Then I get dressed from the cloth hanger [wd7,-s] .
After washing, I begin to prepare my breakfast.
I put some water into my electric cup.
When the water is boiling, adding [,-s] two spoons of milk powder into the water and stiring [fm2,-] it, and then put three or four square [cc4,-1] sugar.
As soon as the milk is boiling, I breaking [vp4,-s] an egg into the milk and mix it together.
Wait are [wd7,-s] minute, it is ready to have.
I have milk and biscuit [np6,4-] for my breakfast.
Maybe I pay much attention to my breakfast, because it makes me full of energy during the day.
After I finished [vp6,-s] my breakfast at 7:00 .I begin to listen to the radio--VOA, but sometimes I can't get the clear signal, so I listen to the China Radio now and then.
Until 7:30 .
I prepare [vp1,-2] to class, combing my hair, wearing shoes.
Patting [wd3,-s] the books into the bag.
Etc.
At 7:45.
I walk on my way to the classroom  To be a secretary is not as simple as you think.
Guangzhou is an attractive city.
Since the open policy was practiced in 1978.
Its economy is developing at a rapid rate.
People think that Guangzhou is an ideal place to earn money.
So many people crowd here to make a living.
Especially the people from mothern [fm1,-] China.
Lifany was one of this kind of persons.
She was twenty years old with a pretty face.
She know [vp6,-s] a young man who came from Guangzhou in her hometown--Liao Lin province.
The young man told her that he could find a good job for her in Guangzhou.
One monthly paid [wd2,2-] was equal to one year's in her hometown.
Lifang was attracted by his sweat [fm1,-] words and trusted him.
She followed the young man to come [wd5,0-1] to Guangzhou one month past [wd2,-] , the young man did not find a job for her.
Li fang [fm3,-] began to feel anxious because she almost ran out of her money.
She asked the young man when she could work..
The young man told her that he had found a secretary job.
The paid [wd2,1-5] would be one thousand yuan per month, and she could also have a room which was given by the boss.
He took Li fang to the room and asked her to wait for her boss there for interview .
Lifang did as the young man said.
She stayed in the room alone after the young man left.
The room had nothing except a bed and a chair.
After a while, someone opened the door with a key.
A sixty year old man entered into [wd5,1-2] the room.
He closed the door and locked it.
He looked sinister with his belly stuck [vp5,6-1] out.
When he saw Lifang, he sprang on her liked wolf.
Lifary was frightened and struggled hard to get free.
The old guy told her coldly that he had paid the young man 30,000 yuan for buying her.
If she did not obey him, she had to pay back to him.
So that [cj1,-s] , all her happiness was ruined poorly.
After I leant [fm1,-] that, the idea which was to be a secretary in the future was given up.
Athough [fm1,-] not all are the same case, I know I have to choose my job carefully.
Mrs Landlord: I am sorry to bother you, but I can not stand the noise come [vp1,3-3] from the [wd5,1-2] upstair, since they moved in, I never have a good time.
If the noisy [wd2,1-] continue [vp3,2-] .
I think I can do nothing except breaking the contract with you and move out immediately.
I was told there are three girls living together above me.
I don't understand why they make noise all the time.
It seems they never get tired.
In the morning, when the sky still is dark, they begin to do morning exercise [np6,2-] .
In [fm3, -] the room, running, jumping and even singing.
Sounds [np3,-1] is very disgusting.
I'm afraid that them [pr4,-] floor will fall down one [wd7,5-] .
I look at the clock, oh, my godness [wd3,2-] , It [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] a [wd5,-s] only five.
I can not sleep any more.
So drinking coffee in the morning has become my hobby.
In order to make me awake .
In the evening, I usually do my homework till 10.Every time, when I am thinking about something, I always [ad1,-s] be [vp4,2-4] disturbed by sharp shouting, chatting or laughing.
And they [wd5,-s] the voice [wd3,1-3] of the TV set can be heard a mile away.
So I can not concentrate my mind on study, I just go to bed, But when I lay [vp6,-s] down on the [wd5,1-1] bed, them [pr4,-3] mini concert begin I can hear a few boys join their party.
After I heard [vp6,-s] the Rock and Roll's music, I lost [vp6,-s] my appetite.
I usually say to myself, Please allow me to have a good night.
Read 10,000 volumes and travel 10,000li.
I have travel [vp9, 2-] two places, Xian and Hangzhou.
I think I prefer scenic spots to ncient relics.
Last summer vocation.
I went to Xian with some friends for travel.
I was told that xian [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] a [wd5,1-3] an ancient city and has many historical monuments.
We traveled the tomb of the Chinese Emperor and thousands of life.
Size [fm3,-] terra- cotta figures.When I steped into there, I felt uncomfortable, every where [fm2,-] is so serious, everyone's pace [wd3,1-3] looked so sad.
I could say nothing beautiful there, [wd4,-s] only saw many clay figures, everywhere is so solemn.
Though the guild [wd3,1-5] explain [vp6,-s] to us so patiently.
I could not enjoy it.
Another thing I disliked is that we could not take photo there.
I didn't understand why, that is one of them [pr4,2-1] rules.
The guide explained that the excavation of the underground [wd5,1-1] vault of earth revealed thousands of terra-cotta warriors and their horses in battle fomation [fm1,-] , and the whole army would follow its emperor into immortality.
I am not interested in ancient history, so I felt very dull and went out alone before they finished the visit.
After the travel of xian [fm3,-] .
We [fm3,-] went to Hangzhou.
Hangzhou has many senic [fm1,-] spots.
Such [fm3,-] as Monastery of the Spirits' Retreal, Pagoda of six Hammories and West Lake.
Hangzhou is famous for its west [fm3,-] Lake, it has such places of interest and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.
This is the second largest island in West ake--Landscaped [fm3,-] in typical Chinese style.
It has many small pavilions, terraces, display rocks and flower beds.
The guide as a pretty girl .She told us the story about this island, I was so interesting [aj4,-s] , Until now.
I can remember the whole story, and I often tell the other people, Then we traveled the lake by boat, The water was green clear and very quiet.
We sat on [wd3,1-2] the oat and enjoyed the beautiful scene.
I suddenly pelt [fm1,-] that I became a fairy maiden.
Travling [fm1,-] [fm3,-] in the fairyland.
On both side [np6,1-] of [wd4,-s] lake, there are two dikes--the Bai and the su [fm3,-] .
On the each dike.
You [fm3,-] can see a row of vigorous willow trees.
They are decorated with coloruful light [np6,5-] , so in the evening, you can imagine how beautiful it is, There are many lovers under the tree [np6,6-] .
This place is really strongly impressed on my memory.
People say in heaven is paradise, on earth are Suzhou and Hangzhou.
This saying is true.
I have been to two kinds of restaurants .
The [fm3, -] High [fm3,-] class restaurant and the low class restaurant.
When you enter a high class restaurant, you must dress well.
There is a beautiful girl at the door, standing behind a counter, she will ask you did you make reservation [,-s] > If not, she will lead you to a table.
Then, two or three waitresses in uniform will come to you, one will make tea for you.
 [wd4,-2] Other one will bring you a small hot towel.
Another one will stand beside you, waiting [vp1,-4] you to order food, she often introduces the most expensive food or drinks to you.
She is so patient and hospitable that you don't want to refuse her.
She smiles broadly on her face, try her best to please you.
She is so skillful [wd4,-s] I sometimes wonder whether she graduated from public relation [np6,1-] school.
When you look around, everywhere is so quiet.
People talk in low voice [np6,4-] .
Of course, the environment and condition of the restaurant are luxurious.
Maybe,some people think the food of the high clan [wd7,-s] restaurant is cleaner than the low class one.I don't think so, I think the food is clean unless you go into their kitchen.
The service charge of high lass restaurant will make you headache.
During the meal, you can not talk freely.
You must have good table manner [np6, 1-] .
Sometimes, fter you finish your meal, you still feel hungry.
But the bill of the meal is very expensive.
There is not [np9,2-4] this kind of case in low class restaurant.
We usually call "Da Pai Dang" when [fm3,-] [wd4,-s] center [fm1,-] there, you will feel more comfortable, It seems everyone is your friend, you will feel [vp1,-2] like stay at your home, you can order food at your own will, Although the environment is not o good, you feel so free.
Instead of [wd4,1-3] controlled by others.
There is no service charge there and the tea is free too.
You can talk willingly.
After you finish the meal, you will think it is worth [aj2,-3] to spend money there.
Friend Friend is one part of our life.
Everybody has friend [np6,-s] .
Some peoples [np6,-s] have many friends.
Because they like to make friends .
They think friends are as important as their life.
Without friends, they will feel lonely, everything will became [vp9,2-1] meaningless.
And live a happy life .
To other people, Making [fm3,-] friends is not them [pr4,-1] interest.They think building up friendship with a friend is wasting time, and friends will bring them trouble.
They enjoy loneliness.
To another [np9,-s] people,they don't the [wd7,2-2] many friends.
Two or three close friends are enough for them.
They found [vp6,-s] real friendship only [ad1,-s] can be built up among two or three people.
So, different people have different opinion [np6,4-] to define friends.
A friend indeed is a friend in need.
This is my definition of a friend.
When I come across difficulty.
She [fm3,-] can give her hand to me.
And [fm3,-] tries her best to help me get out of trouble.
In daily life, we can share joys and sorrows.
Once, I got fever.
It was very serious I felt too sick [wd4,1-3] go to class.
In school .
I can [vp6,-s] do nothing.
Only lay in bed all the day .
I didn't drink and eat, my illness became more and more serious.At that time, I missed my so [ad1,0-1] much family, I even cried on the bed.
Susan knew this, she came to my room quickly after class.
And [fm3,-] gave me a few words of comfort.
She took me to the school clinic.
Cooked meal for me and took good care of me .
I cried the second time.
Because [fm3,-] I was so moved that I could not help crying .I realized I really had a real friend.
In my daily life.
I observed some different phenomenon [np6,1-] which people treat their friends.
When some girls have boy friend [np6,4-] , they don't like to make other friends, even girlfriend [np6,-s] .
They think a boyfriend is enough for them.
They only like to spend all the spare time with their lover [np6,1-] .
To me.
I can't accept this.
This will make me crazy.
And [fm3,-] become more and more unsociable and uncommunicative.
Rose is my roommate.
She is very lovely and amiable.
We always play together, going to the classroom hand in hand every morning, making joke in our dormitory.
Weeven [fm2,-] talk [cc3,-1] heart [wd4,-s] each other.
She has become my close friend since we knew each other.
Many times, after she went back home, I felt very lonely on [wd4,-1] campus and waited for her return.
Yesterday morning, something happened to us, I am used to listen [vp4,2-] to the VOA at 7:00 AM.
So I get up earlier than Rose.
Other roommates usually go out very early.
So rose and I are the last two ones [wd4,-] to leave.
The room was so quiet yesterday morning.
I knew only Rose was still in bed.
I concentrated my mind on the VOA report.
Suddenly, I felt two hands was holding my neck tightly behind me.
" Oh, ghost!
' I couldn't help jumping up from the chain and crying and [fm3,-] then.
I turned back, "Oh,my God, it is you," I shouted angrily, "You want to scare me to die [wd2,3-] "?
I felt a little pain on my neck, "I just wanted to play with you, I didn't mean it, why you are [wd1,-s] so angry [aj2,-2] to me" She replied and her voice seemed almost to cry.
I didn't look at her and sat back to my chain [wd3,4-] .
She walked away.
We didn't talk to each other for a long time.
I thought of [wd5,0-1] myself [wd5,-] that maybe I was too serious just now, we always make joke.
I persuaded myself to forget it.
I looked at the watch.
It was nearly the time for clan [wd7,-s] .
I took the bookbag [fm2,-] and walked to the chain [wd3,-s] .
" Shall we go to the classroom " I said gently.
She still kept silence on our way to classroom.
I told her a humorous conversation.
Last Sunday was my birthday and my mother asked me.
" What kind of gift do you want me to send you " I prefer a peace and quiet environment " I answered.
My mother entered into [wd5,1-2] my room and moved out my treasured recorder.
eally, This [fm3,-] humorous conversation gained Rose's smile.

Dear sir.
I have been your downstairs neighbour for nearly one year.
I am quite heartened to have a hard-working and easy-going neighbour like you.
However, in recent mouths, I have been suffering a great deal of noise coming from your apartment which makes me quite upset and to write you this letter.
For the past two months, almost every afternoon, I found it hard to fan [wd3,5-] asleep while your recorder kept playing certain music.
Although most of the songs were my favourites as well, I did find they wore [fm1,-] not played at a right time, for I think the eriod of time between 1:00p.m and 2:30 p.m should be the time f st.
I am not criticizing your schedule here,but I do need uiet as your neighbour.
Yesterday, you kept playing the Rock roll [fm2,-] songs in a loudly [wd2,2-1] voice throughout the afternoon and I was orced to go out for a walk instead of sleeping.
I used to have the habit of going to bed early at night.
But I am now changing it for your sake.
Every night you return rather late and make a lot of noise which awakes me quite often.
Last Saturday night I was awaken [vp7,2-2] to find it was three o'clock in the morning.
Again I am not blaming you for your habit, but I would be most grateful if you could make your steps softer and your movement less noisy on return.
It always took me half an hour to wait for the end of the noise of the bumps of door and chairs etc.
Your final two heavy bumps of throwing your leather shoes sometimes almost frightened my heart to jump out.
Living in the same building, I think we have got to establish a good relationship between us, which simply means our mutual respect to each other.
I hope you will share my opinion and allow me a quiet and easy life.
With my best regards.
Yours faithfully     Zhang Long    Parties I Have Been To Three kinds of parties have presented me with various feelings: festival party, birthday party and farewell party.
They have brought to me happiness.
Embarrassment [fm3,-] and even sadness.
Festival party is the kind that I enjoyed most.
For I did feel happy in attending it.
Festival party is for everybody and ll the attendance [wd3,-s] have the chance to participate [vp1,-2] the activities rather than just sit and watch.
While celebrating the festival n forms of singing.
Dancing [fm3,-] and cheers.
We could all sense the gay atmosphere then and wore [fm1,-] delighted that colorful new days were coming soon.
I met lots of acquaintances in the parties, who were equally cheerful as I was.When talking about the impression,we all agreed that the party was great.
Birthday party sometimes made me feel bored and embarrassed, for I was sometimes invited to a stranger's birthday party.
Not knowing how to formulate my best wishes, I sat there in silence, ith a forced smile on the face, This always made people feel that I was uncommunicative and I often failed to give any xplanation to redeem my image.
Even when attending a friend's birthday party I still felt uncomfortable.
Since I considered myself a close friend of the host, I used to act like a bee, often talking many [np8,-2] irrelevant nonsense ,doing many unnecessary things.
I used to attract so much attention that the host, who had expected to be the key man in the party, became unhappy with me.
And it has always been too late for me to realize that I had made myself ridiculous.
Farewell party is the kind of party bringing me unspeakable sadness.
The atmosphere of it had been expected to be joyful.
But we always failed to restrain our reluctant feeling to part and the party used to end up in a sad atmosphere, with everybody in tears or in a bad mood.
There will certaintly be more parties ahead for me to ttend.
I will also be supposed to behave properly.
I wish there would e some new kinds of parties different from those I have tended nd I could feel happier and comfortable in them.
Two Different Schools Guangzhou University of Foreign Languages (GUFL) and Linan University are surely of two different types as far as their environment.
Academic [fm3,-] atmosphere and entertainment activities etc are concerned.
Locating [vp5,-s] at the foot of Baiyun Mountain , GUFL enjoys a autiful and tasteful [cc4,-1] environment, Which [fm3,-] allows its people to work and study in a peaceful way.
One can be free of the noise and excitement downtown, breatheing [fm2,-] the pure and fresh air here and taking a rest on the meadows or in the shadows of the trees.
As to INU.
Which [fm3,-] lies nearly at the center of the city, the noise and the polluted air from the busy traffic nearby and the [wd5,-3] several large markets and shops surrounding it does [vp3,-s] make people on the campus suffer a lot.
Moreover, the four main gates of INU are usually open to the outside world, which makes people outside always go in for a sightseeing or merely for a rest.
So the school is now becoming more and more like a public park.
The academic atmosphere in INU seems to be more active than that in GUFL.
Various kinds of lectures , discussions or debates are held in INU almost every week, focusing on international trade and finance issues stock market problems and social phenomena etc.
Students take active part in these ctivities and bring their talents and knowledge from textbooks into full play.
However.
People in GUFL seem to be indifferent in such activities which will actually benefit them a lot.
Occasionally you can have a public lecture or sth else, but most students are not very interested in it and the attendants [wd3,-s] are always less active.
GUFL is proud of its colorful entertainment activities which include singing contest.
Dancing [fm3,-] performance and poem reciting etc.
Every season we have various activities to add colors to our life.
All these activities are organized by the school and are all successful.
In INU the situation is a bit different.
Owing to its large scale, every department is responsible for its own mattes [fm1,-] .
So you can only find some small scale entertainment activities held by each department.
They thus don't cause any sensation.
There are only few activities which are organized by the school and can round off.
CUFL and INU may have many things in common as an university.
But they really differ in the above aspects.
How to learn the CECL Course  The full name of CECL is Communicative English for Chinese Learners.
It is a course for English majors and is taken as a practice in GUFL.
This course emphasizes [vp1,-6] more on training the student's ability of listening comprehension and spoken English and it also includes certain amount of exercises for writing and reading.
The whole textbook is divided into about forty units, each dealing with a topic of life, culture, history, geography science, medicine and [wd5,-s] etc.
In using this textbook, students will be instructed to do the reading.
Listening [fm3,-]  writing and speaking practice.
All these exercises are concerned about [wd3,-] the topic of the unit.
For example if the unit is about Cuisine [fm3,-] .
You [fm3,-] will need to read several passages about, say,the various styles of cuisine, the making of certain Chinese dishes, the proper [cc4,2-5] wrong of using western table wares etc.
Having gone through the passages, students will be instructed to some do exercises, say, writing down some points of the idea embodies [vp5,7-3] in the passages.
For the listening comprehension exercises, students will be required to listen to a dialogue or something else about how the foreigners feel about Chinese food or the process of cooking a Chinese dish etc.
Students will then need to grasp the main ideas and write them down or to use the information they have heard to fill in blanks or charts.
The most active step in learning this course is the oral practice.
Students will be encouraged to discuss certain topics about the unit between them, Sometimes with the help and organization of the teacher, the students will have an animated debate.
Through these oral practice [np6,2-] , the students will be able to not only practise their spoken English, but also express their own ideas upon the topic.
Having finished the unit, the students will usually be asked to write an essay or composition about the topic they have dealt with, writing down their feelings or impressions.
Before the teaching of each unit, students will be given a word [wd5,1-5] list of the new words and phrases to help them.
A pair of earphones is also provided for each student for their listening exercises.
CECL does have many advantages in training students' comprehensive ability.
It helps to broaden the students' knowledge as well.
However, a lot of improvements are still needed to make it bettor [fm1,-] serve the purpose of teaching English majors    Friend  The dictionary has varied explanations for the word " friend " ranging from " person one knows and likes "to" helper to " supporter " No matter how different [wd2,-s] people view " a friend" as surely there is one thing in common, a friend should be a person who is familiar with you and you two do enjoy a relationship.
When you are lonely and depressed, you may need a friend to be with you, for you need someone who is patient enough to listen to you and to propitiate your sorrow or anger.
A friend is a person who knows you well and is inclined to share your misfortune when you are in trouble.
The friendship may make you believe that at least there are your friends in the world who will care about you and you may talk [wd3,-s] to for help.
Sometimes you may merely feel like to talk to someone to have our happiness shared by more people.
Again you need your friends to be with you.
You may have a good time together and this hilarity will surely drive away your loneliness.
Some people may think that a friend is a person who can give help and support.
But I would like to claim that a friend is a person whom you need not to wear disguise before.
You may tell him or her your secret and he or she will keep it for you.
When you suffer frustration in job, life and love etc.
You may go to find your relief and pleasure in friendship.
For [fm3,-] your friends will assure you that they will always stand by you and be ready to help .
A friend is a person whom you may go for help without the least hesitation and ceremony.
A friends [np6,1-] is a person who will do all the needed things for you without being asked for or paid for.
I can not imagine what my life will be if I fail to find any friend but only emimies [fm1,-] and hypocrites.
My frends [fm1,-] are part of my life.

That was a rather cold winter morning.
The wind was blowing so fiercely that it [vp3,1-2] drive almost everybody back to his warm house.
But there were a group of homeless people-a father and his two daughters.
Wandering aimlessly in the long, [fm1,-] peopleless [fm1,-] street.
When they passed a gate which had a severe wire screen, their feet were tempted by a sweet song of hymn, Oh, [fm2,-] what a peaceful little song!
" The father couldn't help looking through the window to see [fm1,-] what' [vp5,2-0] happen.
 [,0-4] He put [wd7,2-2] is younger daughter, fm2,-] who was not more than 3 on his shoulder and let the older one stand beside him.
They discovered a wonderful [np5,4-7] work on the other side of the gate, a warm, cheerful, [fm2,-] totally different [wd4,5-6] from the one they are living.
There was a young, amiable mother sitting at a stove in which the cheerful fire is radiating its red, warm light generously to the [fm1,-] whold house.
Several little children, who were tidy, lovely, were playing happily around their mother.
They are singing, dancing, playing with their little dog.
They apparently knew nothing about the cold world outside the room.
 [fm2,-] However, on the other side of the gate, you can't find any cheerfulness but sadness and the feeling of longing for something.
The little girl sitting on his father's shoulder appeared to be totally attracted by the sign she saw.
" [fm3,-] what a big cake they have!
They have so many [np6,4-6] candy and a dog who can dance!
" As she [fm1,-] though of this, her mouth was watering.
Something was glimmering in her bright blue eyes.
Maybe that night she would have a good dream of cake and candy.
But a gale of [cc4,0-1] keen wind [vp1,5-8] made the poor girl [vp9,4-2] couldn't help [fm1,-] shiering with cold.
 [fm2,-] [fm1,-] He elder sister with baggy clothes and rumblered [fm2,-] fair hair, was staring [vp1,-] that amiable mother.
Her eyes were directed by every movement of the woman.
The other inside made she [pr4,1-] think of her own mother who left her only a vague but warm memory.
The tears dimmed her eyes.
 [fm2,-] The father, who was as baggy as his two daughters, stared fishily forward.
A deep [np5,2-2] melancholy obviously remained on his face.
He appeared to see nothing about the happy life inside because at that moment he was occupied by the hard work of thinking out a place for his two kids to sleep before dark.
Every morning in the school, my life is just like a race in which I have to try best to get ahead.
If not, I will surely be put in a very negative state.
In cold winter morning, getting out of my warm bed is always a terrible thing for me.
At about 6: 20 am, after a long struggle and self-encourage [wd2,2-0] , I manage to leap from the bed in great strength and enormous speed, This very action usually triggers a lot of [np6,3-3] complaint from the person who is sleeping on the above bed.
I have no time to listen to her nonsense because my mind is fully occupied by another urgent business-- capture a tap in the washing room!
In the ten mintues from 6:20 to 6: 30 the begin [wd2,1-3] of morning [np6,1-0] exercise, the washing room is an extrimely [fm1,-] popular place to go.
I take a great difficult [wd2,4-3] in wedging myself into a [wd7,4-3] chink between too people and begin washing.
But how unfortunately I am, [fm3,-] the person standing beside me has a habit of washing violently, splashing water everywhere on my face and clothes.
But I have no time to quarrel for there are half [np6,1-1] dozen people waiting behind.
At that moment, I make a vow that next day I will get up very early!
 [fm2,-] Then there comes another fighting-racing to the playground at sonic speed.
People are running with their wild hairs, a cloud of dirt like thousands of horses passing by.
I am running in this army, looking firmly and [fm1,-] anxiouly at the destination, taking every slice of energy to try to touch the rushing line.
But this time, not for the gold medal, just for not having my name recorded on the teacher's little muster [fm1,-] boll for coming late.
 [fm2,-] The morning exercise lasts only five mintues.
But you never think the annoying struggle is coming to the end.
The five mintues exercise is a kind of relaxation for the later fiercer competition- [fm1,-] rashing to the student's dinning room.
If you don't [fm1,-] harry up a bit, you'll probabally have to wait in the line , and [fm1,-] ore importantly, the most delicious food would have been sold [fm1,-] ut.
 [fm1,-] Due to y tremedous [fm1,-] speed, [fm2,-] I am always [wd4,3-3] the several persons who get to the dinning room first.
So I get my breakfast [fm1,-] easly.
 [fm3,-] sometimes I have a bowl of rice noodle and sometimes one or two buns.
Then I sit at the table and supplement the energy lost in the previous struggles.
But [fm1,-] alase!
When I look at my watch, I find this only enjoyment is impossible.
 [fm3,-] Because I have to finish the breakfast and return back [wd5,1-] to the [fm1,-] domitory before seven o'clock, the time for listening to English [fm1,-] programm in radio.
So I devour those buns and [np6,2-0] noodle and this fast movement of mouth makes my stomach uncomfortable a whole morning.
 [fm2,-] Then I succeed in reaching the [fm1,-] domitory before 7:00.
Thanks Heaven, [fm3,-] before the class [vp3,3-2] begin, I have a short period of time to release [wd3,-] a little bit after all.
At the railway station Waiting train in railway [np6,1-0] station is almost a very happy and tiring experience in China, [fm1,-] espetially [fm1,-] her in Guangzhou.
Because it is always over crowded.
 [fm2,-] Last winter holiday, I had an [fm1,-] unfotfetable experience in Guangzhou railway station.
I got to the station one hour's early of the departure time.
My friend Zhang saw me off and [vp6,4-2] help me carry a big bag, [fm3,-] when we arrived, we were frightened by such a scene: [fm2,-] thousands or even millions of people huddled outside the station, [fm2,-] pushing o and fro, yelling and jostling.
Most of them were peasants who came to Guangdong provinee [fm1,-] to find jobs and at that time they re about to go back home to spend [np6,1-1] Spring Fastival [fm1,-] with their families.
Many of them could not buy tickets and wandered all away outside the station.
 [fm2,-] When I took great trouble in wedging myself in the waiting room, I found I have my hand bruised.
The situation there was not much better than outside.
All the seats were occupied by peasants who unvariedly carried three or four bags with them, Many without a seat simply sat on the ground.
Some even slept on the floor using their bag as [np6,2-0] pillar and slumbered heavily.
I looked around and discovered a seat was occupied by a very dirty big [fm1,-] gunnysack which was obviously owned by the girl sitting beside.
Actually, the girl was sleeping with her dust-covered face [vp5,4-2] expose to everybody.
 [fm2,-] Her hair was wild like coarse grass.
Her mouth opened slightly and slumbered.
Her two legs opened widely and extented [fm1,-] to a long distant [wd2,2-0] but one of her [np6, 3-5] hand was holding tightly her sack.
All seemed that the girl concerned nothing about her manner.
With great disgust, Zhang shouted at her " Hey!
 [fm2,-] Move away your bag!
" This great voice seemed to [fm1,-] starltle the girl, [fm3,-] she opened her eyes suddenly and looked frightened like a hurt bird.
At that time, I found the girl was very pretty, [fm3,-] she looked at most 16 years old.
Even with a lay of dust on her face you could find immediately that she had a very smooth and fair skin.
She raised her amazing beautiful eyes looking at us heedly [wd7,-] and them quickly [vp6,13-5] move the sack off the seat.
 [fm2,-] I sat down and smiled at her and she [vp6,5-5] return me a sweet smile too.
 [fm2,-] Then we began a friendly chat.
She told me about her parents, her younger brothers and sisters and [fm1,-] them she claimed [fm1,-] poundly that she was good at pushing in the crowd and never bothered to buy a ticket and never failed to escape ticket checking.
But Suddenly, she stopped her mouth and became watchful as if [np7,4-3] a experienced hunting dog smelt something unusual.
And then she spoke to me: "Get ready for pushing.
Remember, ook [fm1,-] only ahead, [fm3,-] push hard with all your strength forward!
" Almost [wd4,1-3] the same time, the crowd began to gather towards the door, [fm3,-] everybody looked very determined and prepared for a war, [fm3,-] the great pushing forward movement began.
Following the nimble girl who was like a fish swimming skillfully in the sea of people, I almost lost my sense.
I didn't know whether my feet till touched the floor and my left arm pulling my bag behind still belonged to me.
I only knew that somebody's leg would vp9,3-2] tripped me up if the girl had not held my hand.
Children were crying and women [fm1,-] screened everywhere.
 [fm2,-] The situation was very dangerous.
I couldn't reathe [fm1,-] and I just wanted to cry.
I thought I was done for at that time.
Something hooked my sweater and made a big hole in it.
I almost ate the hair of the girl [fm1,-] net to me.
After about 10 [np4,2-2] minutes deadly struggle, I found myself standing on the train alive.
What a nightmare!
What a terrible experience!
At that time, I thought of the beautiful girl and looked around the train, but I never saw her again.
Since the tourist industry is flourishing in recent years, and more people are involved in it.
Many young people are holding jobs as tourist guides.
Like other occupations, the job of a guide has its own advantages and drawbacks so it is hard to say it is good or bad.
Sometimes it can be very attractive and profitable, Sometimes it will be rather unpleasant.
A friend of mine who is working for CITs [fm1,-] GuangZhou branch as a torist [fm1,-] guide, often has many stories about her job to tell.
I remember that was a sunny spring day.
She called on me [fm1,-] nexpectedly at my dormitory [fm1,-] .
When I first saw her, I almost couldn't recognize her.
She was rather thin, campared [fm1,-] with the [wd7,7-5] precious time I had seen her, she seemed to have lost 5kg weight.
 [fm2,-] Her face was [aj3,3-4] darker and full of weariness.
" I am gong to die.
" She said with little energy as soon as she saw me.
And then she began [fm1,-] hr endless and angry complaint about her new job.
She said with great dislike "Everyday I have to get up very early, sometimes there is even no time to finish [wd4,7-1] breakfast.
And then I have a group of people [fm1,-] [vp5,6-1] fellow me wherever I go, which makes me feel like a fool.
Then you have to answer all kinds of silly questions raised by dozens of them.
It is very boring.
I have to repeat the same story hundreds of times and even so, still there are some foolish fellows who can not make clear and keep asking without an end.
Usually, I can't have lunch in time which causes serious problems in my stomach.
So, I advise you: Do not take up the job as a tourist guide, or you'll regret!
" Knowing so much disadvantages of the job, I almost made up my mind that tourist [np6,1-4] guide was the worst job in the world.
Then I asked her: "How about changing,  [pr4,3-1] you job and try to find another one?
" "No, I won't " she refused me without hesitation.
"You know, though the job is rather tiring, it is really a money-making one.
You get a lot of [np6,5-4] tip if you are Lucky.
" Her answer confused me.
Sometimes I just can't understand why people do things which they don't like.
Is money so important?
Maybe, I'll understand it in some future day.
Gary Cooper was the kind of man who you will never forget once you see him.
Even in a crowd of people you can have no trouble in pointing him out at once both because of his enormous height and a scarcely-seen stern face.
He was in his late 30's and looked physically strong and mentally keen, advancing with big and rapid strides [fm1,-] n the street where only a few numbers of people were wandering.
One of his long [np6,4-3] hand was swinging forcefully, accompanying [fm1,-] the movement of his legs, while the other hand seemed never to be moved away from the pistol hung on his loin.
He was always watchful like [np7, 1-3] a excellent hunting dog and prepared to draw upon the gun to deal with any unexpected attack at any time.
He was wearing a smart white shirt and a pair of black trousers.
A high quality black leather waistcoat was suitably covered on.
He was wearing a belt round his waist in a casual way and a [wd7,1-5] packet watch shining [fm1,-] n the [fm1,-] un.
He had a long and ough [fm1,-] face with clear edges and corners.
That kind of roughness was only owned by those who had experienced innumerable dangers nd [fm1,-] trauma.
His nose was extremely long and straight which made you immediately associate with the one made of plaster stone.
His mouth was held tightly and the corners of the mouth bent downward cynically.
Although the brim of his hat had almost [fm1,-] elipsed his eyes, you could feel two columns of cold lights projected from them which would made everybody shiver with fear.
His eyes was fierce and full of determination.
There was always a slice of sneer hanging on his face where some kind of murderous intent was hiding behind.
He was forging ahead with a face as cold as ice.
There is no doubt that [wd4,5-2] unusual was about to happen at his destination.
Mrs Brown, I am writing to you to express my [wd7,2-1] treat unsatisfaction [fm1,-] about the [fm1,-] nbearable noises your family have made and your ignorance on [wd3,-] my last complaint letter.
For this time, I have to admit that being a neighbour of your family is really a great suffering and a nightmare.
I can hardly find a word to describe the disturbance you've brought to us.
Every morning, Your family gets up as early as 6:00 and your warmming [fm2,-] up morning exercise follows.
I know your husband is a basketball coach, but it doesn't mean that he has the [wd4,s-] to bounce the ball heavily against the floor under which several people are still asleep.
We are all waken up by such dreadful bouncing [np6,3-0] noise and my old grandma is sually [fm1,-] frightened and made sick.
After the ball stops making [np6,4-0] noise, I suppose [fm1,-] a family sportsmeet [fm1,-] is taking place, [wd4,14-2] we hear [np6,2-3] noise of rope skipping which vp3,5-5] sounds like a working cutting machine and then I guess you must have other activities, such as high jumping and hurdle racing.
The enormously big noises come abruptly which can [vp9,1-2] made people mad.
I won't [vp7,2-2] surprise one day there will be a hole [vp5,5-3] appear in the floor and somebody will fall down if you continue to [fm1,-] stramp your feet with so much force on it.
In [np6,1-0] evening, things are not better than [np6,5-0] morning.
You always turn on your H. F. to the highest volume and [,0-1] I sure everyone on the neighbourhood knows you have owned a H. F. [fm2,-] The sharp, noise [fm1,-] ervades everywhere in our room, which [,9-11] is unable us to hear clearly the play in our own TV.
Sometimes Your activities can even go late into night.
All these bring much unhappy experience to us and also do great harm to our health.
I hope the medical exam report of my grandma won't have [fm1,-] may [np6,3-0] problem, or I will phone the police and [fm1,-] cal my lawyer to handle this business.
Your angry neighbour              Mrs [fm3,-] john Friends I [fm3,-] have [fm3,-] had Friends I have had can be generally classified to two types: [fm3,-] One is the type I need most when I am in a good mood.
 [fm3,-] The other one is needed when I am in trouble, feeling frustrated, deflated or I have something that has to be confided.
Usually, friends of the first kind are those who have fairly cheerful, lively, [wd4,4-2] [fm1,-] socialable personality.
They are good at [vp2,4-1] making fun, [vp2,0-1] playing joke and creating humorous and happy atmosphere.
On [fm1,-] weekens, I usually go to movies or to karaoke [np6,6-3] bar with such people and always come back with excited and delightful [np6,4-0] feeling.
Especially, [fm2,-] when I am going to have a birthday party, these friends become very essential.
They are the most dynamic elements in the party, enlivening the atmosphere with all their capabitities [fm1,-] .
They are shuttling here and there among the crowd, like butterflies or little rats, dallying with people, [fm2,-] making faces, talking nonsense in order to make others laugh.
Sometimes they hehave [fm1,-] like a fool or a clown and never [wd7,4-7] cure what the other people think of them.
They make everyone feel relaxed and happy, without any doubt, having people like them, [fm3,-] parties often end up with quite a success.
However, friends of the second type are very sentimental.
patient and warm-hearted people.
They do not like talking too much and always seem to be sunk into deep reverie whenever you meet them.
But they are surely good listeners and worth of full trust.
Once I was treated unfairly by a person and felt very annoyed, wanting to blow off the steam.
I told the whole thing to my friend.
Heating [wd3,3-3] my long, breakless [fm1,-] complaint, she looked even more furious than I, [fm1,-] cletching her fist and teeth, [wd7,5-4] curing with all her strenth [fm1,-] "Really a bad egg!
A [wd2,1-1] damn egg!
" At that time I was rather confused, for I couldn't make clear whether the fellow who offended me was the [fm1,-] enimy of her or mine.
We both sat there [wd4,4-2] kept cursing until my tougue [fm1,-] was tied.
After that I felt quite comfortable and to a certain extent, a sense of victory.
Surprisingly, the feeling of angry [wd2,3-2] went away.
Friends of the second type not only can share your angry [wd2,2-0] but also your sadness.
If I tell a sad story of me to them, [fm2,-] usually, their tears have already fallen down even before I have enough time to concentrate all my strenth to produce some.
They listen to you and never lose patience until you feel better.
 [fm2,-] They are the people who are worth of my respect and faith.
I love my friends of the first kind, for they bring me much happiness.
But I love friends of the second kind [fm1,-] mush more, for they are my really reliable good companions.

> <TYP 2> weng yao A Letter to My Neighbour Dear Mr Smith, I'm sorry to inform you of some facts which have [vp6,2-1] bothering me for months.
The noise coming from your house day and night [wd7,9-5] twins my life into a disaster, I could no [fm1,-] linger keep pace with a regular [fm1,-] routin both during the daytime and at night .
 [fm3,-] this wears my patience away and finally drives me to ask you to have mercy upon my weak nerve!
Each morning when I wake up, my eyes were swelling and red, [fm3,-] this was [wd5,-] became the noise ,which was so loud and piercing that could drive people crazy, [,4-8] floating out of your windows a hole night long.
 [,0-15] People upstairs [fm1,-] where laughing, chatting, even shouting, in addition [wd4,2-3] the sounds of throwing ards [wd7,-] and mixing .
 [fm3,-] [fm1,-] he Majiang on a table were also clear.
In the [wd7,2-2] titlner of night, all [fm1,-] there noises were serving [fm1,-] an edles piercing through the ears and [vp1,0-3] caned me [wd3,2-3] feel tinnitus and headache in the daytime .
What's more, your [wd7,1-2] addcition to singing has no [fm1,-] night to [vp4,1-2] made me [vp1,2-3] suffering from no [wd7,3-2] neat at noon I must say you couldn't deprive me of the last chance to have a sleep !
 [fm3,-] why do you always play the Karo O.K.
 [wd4,4-1] noon?
Can you choose another time?
Or if you do feel you can't live without singing.
 [fm3,-] Could you please turn the voice a little bit down?
To be honesty [wd2,2-0] , [pr1,10- 7] it sounds just like wild shrieks and howls .
Besides, you should pay more attention to your vulnerable throat !
 [fm3,-] as I [fm1,-] ouldn't enjoy my precious rest at noon, I always feel sleepy, [fm3,-] [wd3,0-3] sometime I even doubt I have got neurostheria, [fm3,-] as you could easily see from my face , I'm not myself anymore!
I hope this letter could [vp4,1-1] drown some of your attention and the situation [,2-4] to be improved, even slightly.
I'm looking forward with all my heart [wd4,7-3] a quiet night, of [fm1,-] coarse, with your help.
Friends I Have Had Two kinds of my friends: one is active and [wd7,4-0] oacious, the other is quiet and withdrawn, who are seemingly [wd7,3-1] throughout different, have accompanied me through my life from childhood till now.
I like those people of sanguine disposition.
They are always cheerful, preparing for any joke or mischief at [fm1,-] ll time.
They are out-going, never short of friends or companies.
 [fm3,-] however what attracts me [fm1,-] moat is their wisdom, [,0-9] no matter where out [fm2,-] standing performance [wd3,2-3] ensures spoting them easily.
because they are quick-witted, they are [wd4,2-2] teacher's favorites and always the winners of any math-competitions.
Dealing with such friends, you will be easily infected with their light hearts and humorous "remarks"-always [fm1,-] mischivors [fm1,-] bur not ill-willed-and you will be influenced unconsciously by their flexibility and elasticity, which [vp3,4-6] is [np6,5-5] a major [np6,7-3] component of their [fm1,-] haracteristics , and sub-consciously become more adaptable to [wd4,2-1] new environment .
 [fm3,-] to be short, those people [vp3,2-3] makes you more active towards life.
However, if I hadn't the other kind of friends, my life [fm1,-] woud have been incomplete and I myself [vp7,2-0] [vp6, 9-1] paralyzed.
They are the friends talking with my deep heart, which is isolated from the reality and some time become my own voice.
They are always timid, sensitive and sentimental, [fm3,-] you could hardly predict [,4-4] what is their intrinsic quality.
They don't talk much, they only like to listen.
Through their eyes, you know they care about you,despite the indifference shown on their faces.
They look like ice, but inside they are fine, burning silently and [fm1,-] ometimes, when you reach their heart, this fine [wd4,2-3] will warm you and light your eyes.
When I think about my friends,I think of myself.
Since friends are always a mirror of your life.
Two schools during my middle-school study, I have changed [np7,3-3] the school 3 [wd3,3-0] time.
Among them, two impressed me deeply.
One is an [fm1,-] xperimental school in a coastal area, the other is in my [fm1,-] ometown, which is isolated from the outside by [wd4,1-2] range of mountains.
The experimental school is a fairly large one and modern one in content [wd3,s-] with my hometown school.
It has more than 1,000 students and teachers, the school buildings are six-floored, which is rare for [np7,4-2] the ordinary middle-school, and it has a standard sports ground which is covered with sand around and well-cut grass in the centre.
 [vp5,0-8] Comparing with it, the ground of my hometown school, which is only covered with mud and weeds and becomes [wd7,10-3] disabled in rainy season simply becomes a play [fm2,-] ground for children to ride bikes or playing kites in the spring.
All the equipments [fm1,-] and facilities of the experimental school are newly bought or established.
That [wd7,-] became it's a newly set-up school with a history of less than 15 years.
It was set up during Han Dynasty by a county official and now becomes one of the key schools in our province.
>From its buildings, which are covered with red and green stones located in the garden, which are enclosed with the dates and events happened down the history as a monument to the school, you will have no surprise to hear that it was appointed by the state government as a historical preservation unit.
The experimental school, since located in the coastal area, [cc3,9-2] recieves [cc3,-2] much influence from overseas adapts an open [fm1,-] teaching-mathed [fm1,-] , that is, to put more emphasis on the student's ability in performing well not only from an acdemic [fm1,-] angle, but also from the moral, physical and artistical [fm1,-] point of view.
Besides this, they also exchange students and teachers with its counterparts abroad and often bolds discussions even debates among students, [fm3,-] by this means, students are supposed to develop comprehensively.
In comparison with it, the hometown school still concentrates on the traditional teaching method--- teacher- centrism, [fm3,-] among those classes at different [np6,5-3] grade, you can find their curricula are fully arranged, [fm3,-] there's no spare time left for students to learn by themselves, not mention [wd3,-] the time [wd7,3-5] prepared for them to practise computers, work out the model airplanes or play the musical instruments as their [fm1,-] connterparts in the experimental school do.
It's obvious that both teachers and students are aiming at one thing: entering to [np6,2-2] university or colleges, as their ultimate purpose!
< ST 5> <SEX ?> <Y ?> <SCH GDUFS> <AGE ?> <WAY ?> <DIC ?> <TYP 2>??
Dear Sir, I'm sorry but have to write to you, otherwise, I'll probably lose my hearing if your children continue leading a life in such a mess.
I know that most of the months you're out on business, which [cc5,1-6] leaves your home sometime like a battlefield, a sport field or a bar.
Every morning, I'm waken up not by my alarm clock (I'm afraid its sound now is too weak for me), but by your children's quarreling ver [fm1,-] who should make break fast.
Usually the radio is turned on with some "bang" and crash sounds.
It often [vp3,2-] last over an hour.
Then, they start their morning boxing exercises instead of going to school.
I should admit they're making progress, because I found more and more sands falling down from your balcony.
Michael Jackson's pops [fm2,-] songs may be their favorite , they never forget to play it when they "fight".I feel ever [fm1,-] terrible in the afternoon.
Your kids choose the floor as a skate [cc4,-] field.
The wheels make a harsh sound killing my ears.
With Michael Jackson or some heavy metal on the tape, they imitate their singing, shorting , jumping .I can only pray that the floor won't be broken.I'm afraid you know little about your kids.In the evening, they seldom make [np6,1-] noise, instead, I often hear some [np6,1-] scream or crying from the horror [wd2,0-2] video tapes they play.
Either a short [fm1,-] of "Ghost" or "I'll call of you !
" make me tremlle [fm1,-] .
Or the gunfire, or a savage laughter, [pr1,7-0] they arouse my imagination and I'm really living in a might mare [fm1,-] [fm2,-] .
Could you be so kind enough [wd5,2-] to spend a little more time at home and tell your kids to make less noise?
I'll be very grateful if I can spend a day quietly.
Yours, CLASSES I HAVE ATTENDED Three kinds of classes I have attended make my way of taking classes changing from time to time.
There is a kind of [np9,5-2] teachers who like to read what's on the text books.
 [pr1,10-1] He is too prudent to have his own opinion.
When I attend [pr1,12-1] their classes, all I have to do is to take notice of where the teacher is reading and make a mark there.
No note is necessary even though teachers [wd7,1-1] chink [fn2,-] oppositely.
Also the whole class is rather uiet [fm1,-] .
All the students lower their heads, seemingly attentive to something.
Some are reading novels, some are writing letters, some are even listening to walk man [fm2,-] , leaving the teacher by the platform practising [vp5,1-0] read-aloud.
But another kind of class,not like the [wd7,1-2] fore said one, makes us dictating all the time.
The teacher finds some materials that we'll never find, then, read one sentence by sentence to us.
We are kept writing like machines, occasionaly [fm1,-] [fm1,-] [vp4,7-4] look up at the teacher with a begging expression, "Could you please slow down your reading?
" Time eems [fm1,-] to never pass normally in such kinds of classes.
Of course, not all the classes I've attended are like that.
 [vp1,0-20] There are still [fm1,-] ome teachers both follow the text book and have their own opinions and most of all, let us have time to [vp4,5-2] think, to exchange ideas at class.
Usually the atmosphere is warm.
 [fm1,-] ome [fm2,-] times I take note of the information not in the text book, sometimes follow the teacher's instruction to think , to develop my opinion.
Only at that time, can I feel the art of teaching and experience the happiness of learning.
This has been my impression on the classes I've attended in this institute and I wish I'll always have that last kind.
TWO SCHOOLS The first impress [fm1,-] on [pr5,2-6] that schools A and B give you are different stepping into school A,you'll see a small garden with roses, camellias, cannas and other colorful flowers .
But there's only a bituminous road between the schoolB's, gate and the main teaching building -the 10-storey chemical Building.
 [fm1,-] long each side of the road is a line of Chinese parasols.
The chemical Building is obviously newly built.
From the board on the gate of the building, you can see it's onated [fm1,-] in 1992 by a well- off patriotic overseas Chinese While over the garden, the main building in A--the English teaching building, was built 50 years ago, Some windows are broken, too.
As you go further, you'll find that, as a college, A is much smaller in size than B which is a university.
Only two or three more teaching buildings are scattered around the main building of A, containing all the classrooms and offices for 4 departments.
While in B, a single physics Department has 35-storey [np1,2-3] buildings as regwlar [fm1,-] classrooms and a T-storey laboratory building.
About 10 minutes' walk will be enough for you to get a general idea of A's layout.
However, you can hardly make B's layout clear if you have no bike and are not willing to spend at least half an hour.
Another notable thing you may easily find is that there are much more girls in A than in B. that [fm3,-] mainly due to [np9,2-2] that fact that A in a college of languages and B is [np3,2-1] science university.
Both boys and girls choose what interests them as their majors.
In A, girls wearing beautiful clothes are walking on the campus practising oral English or, with a radio in hand , listening to VOA'S special English.
But it's a totally different picture in B--in dormitories, books everywhere, dirty clothes thrown on beds and socks under beds, boys are sitting quietly at the desks, working on piles of assignments the professors have just assigned.
Not like other major English courses like College English or Comprehensive English, CECL course is more vivid and effective for students' first [np1,0-4] two years of basic training in colleges.
Traditionally, students are faced with a long text with numerous new words and grammers [fm1,-] and they have to prepare a lot before the new lesson: look up the new words on [wd3,-] the dictionary, preview the text and so on.
Words phrases and grammer [fm1,-] are the centre of their study.
But for CECL, there is a specific topic for each unit, such as family, to wris [fm1,-] and sport .
Gcturally [fm1,-] , there are few long passages or [np6,4-2] text in CECL, but more listening ,speaking and writing exercises.
So, to take a CECL class, students do not necessarily preview the text.
The only thing they would do is to get their earphones ready .
When the lesson begins, some simple questions related to the central topic are raised by the teacher and comes a small warm [fm2,-] up discussion .Usually there is an [cc4,1-1] according [wd3,-] record by [np7,-] foreign expent [fm1,-] or the same topic [np6,0-5] student then listen to the tape, sometime take notes, to see how's the conversation going.
fter [fm1,-] [fm3,-] that, the teacher helps the student go through some specific terms for the unit.
In sports, there will be the names of various sport games, rules, etc.
For Tourism, there will be [np7,3-5] the introduction of famous scenic spots in China and abroad.
In every unit, there are activities for students to act and talk.
They are devided [fm1,-] into several groups and try [vp6,s-] their best to present vividly some situational dialogues to the whole class.
Thus, in CECL class, the atmosphere is always warm and exciting.
There are almost 20 practical topics in CECL, [wd3,8-3] concerning a wide range.
It's not listening lesson, neither oral English lesson nor writing lesson.
But equally more of [pr1,4-3] these are ruled out.
Students are the centre of the lesson [wd3,-] in [fm2,-] stead of the teacher, which, few other courses can have this as a characteristic.
A Friend A friend is who, when you have been painstakingly travelled along your river of life and want some support , appears like a paddle of a boat.
A friend is the breeze in summer and the bright sunshine in winter.
He pats on your shoulder to give you strength and a sign of under standing [fm2,-] when you lose a match .Passing you a towel or a rink, " [fm3,-] one cannot always be the champion don't [fm3,-] let yourself [fm1,-] own!
" he says slowly but firmly.
He understands [,2-12] when you part with your girl- friend much better than your parents do .
"How about a wrestling, we two?
" He finds a way for you to blow off your steam.
He shorts [fm1,-] your ears when you've lying lazily on bed a whole day, "Hey ,guy, enough rest !
you have got to work now!
Do not be a lagy [fm1,-] bone!
" Sometimes, he is a patient brother, in other time, he is a good guy to play with , and he could be one [wd3,-] instructor as serious as an old grandpa .
A friend shares your sorrows and happiness.
Also, he needs your comfort when in bad mosd [fm1,-] and invites you to enjoy his happiness.
He may have some shortcomings, as on [fm1,-] one is perfect .
But you know him and understand him just as he always treats you appreciate your.
As time passes by, maybe you have charged a lot and so has he.
Maybe you two are far away from each other.
But a friend, who really deserves the word "friend" ,will never be far away.
He is always on [wd3,-] your mind and he always gives you courage and confidence.
A friend is a priceless treasure.
Returning books During the break, I went hurriedly to return some Chinese books.
But when I got there, no assistants could been [fm1,-] seen.
Suddenly, I heard an angry voice," These cheats!
Such rotted gourd worth $2 per jin!
" With these words , a head rose from below the counter.
Then another, "you have got to stand it !
" the latter and younger one tried to soothe the elder assistant , " Nowad [fm1, -] ay, people are crazy for money!
They can do anything for that !
" And she then started to complain how she had been cheated once.
"Excuse me," I hesitatly [fm1,-] asked, "May I return the books now?
" They stopped, turning to me.
It seemed as if a volcano would erupt.
"Pass it to me!
" the younger lady came to me, checking the books," you made these marks?
" she asked me coldly, lifting her eyebrows.
" You are doomed!
" I said to myself.
" well [fm3,-] , No, when I started reading I found the wants [wd7,-] already there.
"" Why didn't you fell [fm1,-] us when you borrow it ?
It [wd7,1-2] want be you !
" She raised her voice.
I made no answer -I could only admit it was a good lesson.
I had thought the assistants must have made all the checkings [fm1,-] and I had been in a hurry when I borrowed it .
At the very moment, the elder lady joined the younger one.
"Another scribbler?
FIWE!
 [fm1,-] " Two [wd3,3-3] man for each place.
How many has she got?
One ...Three... Six ...!!
That's $ 1.
2!
" No sooner had I caught what she said them a fine fill was in front of me.
Skillful assistant!
And I spent $1.2 buying a good lesson..

Dear Mr Smith, I'm sorry to disturb you .
but I'd like to make a complaint with [wd3,-] you .
I've been living for 5 years and used to have a peaceful and tranquil life.
But since you moved in last month.
I find myself [wd7,3-2] smote by noise, which has a rather bad effect on me .
I know that you are a musician and have made a small name [cc1,1-] of your own.
You go to concert every night and come back late.
But when you are going to bed , you drop the shoes on the floor and the sound is loud enough to awake and start [wd3,-] me.
When I wake up.I am unable to drop back to sleep soon.
I haven't had a good sleep for days now, neither can I [wd3,3-5] make it up in the morning, for then, you are plactising [fm1,-] your saxophone.
The music is good but a little bit louder.
It not only puts an end to my repose, but also makes me unable to hear the [fm1,-] whether broadcast on the radio or the news about stock market on TV.
In addition to that.
You host a party every weekend and will not disperse [wd3,-] it until 2 o'clock in the morning.
It drives my sleep away.
When I am lying in bed with eyes open, I can clearly hear the jazz music from the recorder,the laughter f your friends and I even know that one of your friend is nicknamed " cooodpecker" .
I do not mean to put my nose into your affair, but how can I possibly keep the noise out of my house?
If you would please to dissoloe [fm1,-] [wd7,5-3] the party earlier, put down the shoes gently and postpone your time of practising saxphone [fm1,-] I would be much obliged .
With best wishes.
Yours sincerely Three kinds of friends enter my life, tinge it with colours and add its richness: the close friends, the nodding friends and the good-weather [wd7,-1] friends.
I appriciate [fm1,-] and truly love my close friends, because I an confide in them nd [fm1,-] in return I am trusted by them, I precious [wd2,1-2] such friendship.
Because it is rare to obtain.
Common interests link us together and critical time tests the soundness of the friendship.
Though there are no frequent exchange of presents and no sweet [wd2,2-2] flatter between us, I m clearly aware that they really care for me as much as I [wd4,9-1] them , and will jump with alacrity at my asking for elp [fm1,-] .
They give me their hand when I am in bad time, listen patiently to the troubles I pour out to them, and some how [fm2,-] remove it magically .
To stay with them is happy because I can wear my heart [cc3,2-] on the sleeve and need not keep myself to myself.
Straight [wd3,-] for word remarks even [np6,3-2] criticism are welcomed.
They are unlikely to make offences for we know that such frankness is true and sincere.
We share the secrets, rapture and sorrow.
I welcome nodding friends and cherish good will and sincerity toward them.
We can get along well by joking talking story-telling or playing ogether [fm1,-] , though we would not touch the deeper issues of one's mind.
And when meeting by chance.
 [fm3,-] We pick up some general and afe [fm1,-] topics like what happens to a friend recently, or whether she or he likes the job or what place [pr5,2-2] where I visited last summer vocation.
Even when we happen to have disputes no one bother to speak out .
When we depart, [pr1,3-] it become a part of the memory.
No regret for departure, but is willing to meet next ime [fm1,-] .
They often bring laughter and fun to my life, and even a "Hello" in the street makes my heart light.
To those good-weather [wd7,-1] friends, I dislike them.
Because I know they can flatter me to the top of the sky when I am in luck, and they can also shovel me on the ground and pique my dignity.
They are [wd7,2-3] adows [fm1,-] in the sun and will disappear into this air as soon as darkness befalls.
I have been in two middle schools to receive my secondary education.
One is the Attached Middle School of GUFL, the other is Guangzhou No.2 Middle School.
No.2 Middle School is a key school in Guangzhou, there fore [fm2,-] in comparison to the former one, it is more [aj3,3-3] strict in many aspects.
First, No.
2 Middle School has higher [aj3,s-] demand for the entrants.
Because of its fame, is school attracts many students who hope that they can better [wd4,2-4] education nd [fm1,-] training for the college entrance [np6,3-1] examination.
Due to the large number of applicants, the school is able to undergo strict selection.
Good and potential students are enrolled, thers [wd7,6-1] rejected.
While the Attached School is only a common chool [fm1,-] , although it is quite famous for its nglish [fm1,-] teaching and aclievements [fm1,-] , it attracts far less students, not to speak of scientific students.
The grade line for the extrance [fm1,-] is correspondingly lower.
The overall quality of he tudents, there fore [fm2,-] , is not encouraging .
Second, he [fm2,-] NO.2 [fm1,-] MiddliSchool [fm1,-] ets [fm1,-] up a higher standard for its students on their study.
The textbooks, especially maths, physics and chemistry textbooks it ases [wd7,9-3] are more diffult [fm1,-] than those of [np6,2-2] Attached School.
he students are not only required to digest the knowledge in the book, but also trained by doing a lot of additional and more complicated exercises to expand their skill.
While in the ttached [fm1,-] School , due to the overall quality of the students, most of them are only [vp7,5-2] require to understand and master what the textbooks say and use these knowledgt [fm1,-] to do the exercises that are not difficult to deal with.
In addition, the strictness of NO.2 Middle School is lustrated [fm1,-] in its daily-life.
Although it is not a boarding school.
the leaders are very much oncerned [fm1,-] with students' appearance and behaviour.
Students are forbidden to coear [fm1,-] ornaments, boys are not allowed to have long hair, long fingernails [vp3,2-1] is unbearable.
There are often sudden checks on this.
Further more [fm2,-] , students are required to wear uniform at least 3 ays [fm1,-] a week.
Even in [wd7,2-2] oozen [fm1,-] winter mornings, girls have to wear their uniform of western-style dresses.
Those who violate the rules would be criticized openly.
This phenomenon however has never happened in the Attached School.
Students are free to wear colourful clothes, and have small ornaments to add [cc6,-] up their beauty.
This is away vigorates [wd7,3-2] the campus.
CECL, the full name of which is Communicative English for Chinese Learner [np6,5-6] is a set of comprehersive [fm1,-] textbooks.
It covers such knowledge as greeting people, job, food , sports, tourism, economy, and so on , [wd4,3-4] each aspect as a unit.
In each unit, there includes the training of listening , reading, oral English writing and role play .
 [fm1,-] ne characteristic of CECL is its large amount of new words.
Therefore, before the start of a new unit , he teacher will ive [fm1,-] each student a list of the new words of the unit .
Students may look up the words in the dictionary and get themselves familiar with the meanings and us ages.
Futher [fm1,-] preparation depends on the tasks which will be done in class.
Listening exercises, which , often is the first part in a unit , need no preparations.
Before the exercise begins, the teacher will give several minutes for the students to look through the instructions as well as the questions.
Then they may listen to the tape twice and do the task (either fill in some blanks or answer questions ) at the same time.
After that, the teacher will give the answers and analyse the tcpscrips [fm1,-] .
Then comes the second exercise, reading usually, students are required to read the articles before class, look up some words , and have a rough idea of the out line [fm2,-] of the articles.
In [np6,1-3] the class the teacher [fm1,-] ill explain some language points and draw students' attention to some useful words and expressions.
When the students have [vp4,4-3] make clear of the contents exercise be done, which help the students to a better understanding.
Since the articles in a certain unit are all selected to introduce the topic from different angles, it is important that the students have mastered the essence of it.
Group discussion appears in a unit frequently.
It provides good [np6,3-3] opportunity for the students to prictice [fm1,-] their spoken English.
The topics discussed are closely concerned with the unit.
Students are encouraged to express their ideas freely.
And by listening to others opinion [fm1,-] [np6,5-2] , they have a deeper impression about the text.
Role play is another kind of practice.
It calls for the students to take part in the play without teachers intervention.
 [pr3,14-3] They are the writers as well as actors.
They use what they have learned from the unit and try to make the play as vivid and real as possible.
General [wd2,0-1] speaking, CECL is an unique course in which [np6,0-2] teacher and students play equal roles.
Students volutarily [fm1,-] take part in the activities and there fore [fm2,-] master the knowledge more effectively .
There is no doubt that our life is colorful .
But it does not exclude boredom, an in dispensible [fm2,-] element without [pr5,3-10] whose contrast [wd7,3-9] life would no longer appears so interesting and wonderful .
What is boredom then?
It is a dull, uninteresting tedious feeling people have when they have nothing to do or are not interested in doing the things at hand.
Students often suffer from boredom, when they lose their earings [fm1,-] or have no interests in study.
Hollowness and impatience often occupy their [np6,1-1] heart and has [np7, 1-1] a effect on their further studies.
Hobby and different hings [fm1,-] they take up .
Attending class may be dull , because some of the knowledge is losing its attraction, and the way in which some teacher lecture [vp3,2-3] bores the listeners.
Students in our class all agree that The Construction of Socialism is boring, not at all because we have anti-government idea or we dislike the idea.
The teacher will simply stand at the platform, reading at the top of his voice the sentences which we can find in the text book [fm2,-] .
What use does his lecture have while we have eyes to read the textbook ourselves?
" How boreing [fm1,-] it is!
" is the concensus [fm1,-] we get after each class.
Boredom is a company not only to students but also to those who work and don't work.
It seems contra [fm2,-] dictary at the first sight.
But if we know that monotony and repetition are often the featlres [wd7,3-2] of work, it is not difficult to see that even you have something to do at hand.
You may still feel bored.
It is how I felt when I went to the Trade Fair a few weeks ago.
When there were few customers we did nothing but talk or go round and round.
This let's-sit-here-and-talk-to-kill-the-time pattern bored me a lot and I was tired and uninterested in anything.
Boredom is a common disease in the souety [fm1,-] , but not an incurable one.
The best way to frive [fm1,-] it away is to find something which is really of your interest, do it and enjoy it.
This is a funny experience I will never forget.
One day, with 20 yuan in my trousers' pocket I went to downtown area with a friend.
The No.
36 bus we took was crowded .we got on and stood near the door .
a [fm3,-] young man was standing behind me ,one hand taking hold of the iron bar overhead .
as [fm3,-] the bus picked up more passengers along its route, I began worrying about thieves.
luckily [fm3,-] I had never met them, though I often heard about their "good deeds " on buses .
so [fm3,-] consciously, but pretending to be carelessly , I touched my pocket.
The money was there, save [fm1,-] and sound .
several [fm3,-] minutes later, I was aware that a woman was looking at me strangely, her face wearing an expression that I couldn't fully explain.
Just then, I felt there was a slight touch of my pocket, as if something was moving inside I looked down to find the money was somehow drawn out and was about to fall to the floor I could hear my heart beat faster than ever, knowing clearly that I had become a bait of a thief.
Hurriedly I pushed the money back, turned suddenly back and faced the young man behind me.
Obviously he didn't expect that would happen .
 [fm3,-] he was quite uncomfortable [fm1,-] under my staring and hastily looked away.
"well," I said in a low voice, "didn't get it , Eh?
" my words took him by surprise.
Perhaps he had wanted me to keep silent or abuse him loudly and get beaten.
But I was not trapped [fm3,-] my friendly manner made him [wd4,5-3] at a loss.
"um um, " he made his head move up and down, and squeazed [fm1,-] a smile on his face .
"It is really bad luck, isn't it ?
" I asked him, nearly jokingly.
He was not that nervous , but was still embarrassed to be [fm1,-] caugh red-handed.
" [fm3,-] hope you good luck next time," I said and [vp6,3-0] smile.
" [fm3,-] thank you .
" [fm3,-] he was almost grateful at my words and even friendly patted my shoulder.
 [fm3,-] as the bus stopped, I jumped off, and could [wd7,2-8] at wait to tell my friend all about it .
" [fm3,-] you must be [fm1,-] crasy," she said, " aren't you afraid that he would stab you ?
" [fm3,-] no, I was not  [fm3,-] it was a strange but true experience.
I was surprised why my heart was not at my throat when I spoke to the man and I still do not know now.
 [fm3,-] perhaps he was not a bad guy at all and perhaps in his eye ,I was still a [fm1,-] na* ve [fm1,-] but daring little girl.
Patriotism This is an event nearly every Chinese mailand [fm1,-] people and Hong Kong people alike have been awaiting with massive [cc4,-1] excitement and great expectation -- the reunification of Hong Kong to China.
It is a moment of celebration, proud [wd2,4-1] , anticipation and above all, the most telling moment of patriotism which is deep in our heart [np6,1-] .
And this moment is 1997, arriving in several hours from now, as we are approaching July 1st.
Patriotism, which is something beyond words, is what people of different nationalities share universally, and is also a blessing for every nation.
To people, on numerous occasions, it is a mighty momentom [fm1,-] , spurring us to implement [cc3,-4] the most formidable tasks which would have been impossible otherwise.
In [np7,-2] Olympic Games, you can not only feel the touching emotion of patriotism, but also come face to face with it: you see how athletes surmount the various "hurdles" with applaudible [fm1,-] stamina and most important, fortitude, whose sourse [fm1,-] is exactly their love of their country; you see athletes fall from illness but stand up to their task even with a dripping; you see athletes stumble to the ground but climb up and go ahead; you also see champions cry movedly [fm1,-] when their national flag rising [vp4,4-1] proudly.
At such [np7,1-1] moment, they are no longer themselves, rather, their country and their people who also embrace the same burning patriotism and back them all the time.
Outside the stadium, patriotism draws people to TV, newspaper [np6,5-] , focusing on what's going on in the games; even they would fly to the spot somewhere far far away from their home [np6,12-] .
They care for nothing but their country.
We Chinese always take pride in our patriotism.
With it, not only have we weathered untold defeats, shame, poverty, natural disasters, political strife, financial crisis, but also we are building [vp1,-3] up our country industriously and hopefully.
The recent years have witnessed the prosperity in our economics [wd3,3-] , advancement in education, improvement in diplomacy ... .
We owe all our delighting and impressive achievements to our leadership, to our people's efforts, to international aids and above all to the profound patriotism in everyone of us.
In this sense, patriotism means a lot to a nation especially to such a big country as China which was burdened with myriad historic wounds and is expecting countless obstacles and challenges to come.
To a country, Patriotism [fm3,-] means cohesiveness [wd3,2-] .
Cohesiveness [wd3,-2] means omnipotence, With it, we are fearless.
The story of Hong Kong tells much of this.
People of the same nationality and therefore possessing the same ardent patriotism want to be united together and have to be together.
With this in mind, we have been making [vp2,-2] our utmost to negotiate and eventually reach an agreement on the issue of Hong Kong territory with [np7,-2] British governement [fm1,-] but for [pp1,15-3] all the barriers.
It is a dream to come true.
This dream has been both long [wd3,5-] and hard [wd3,7-] for us, while, in the end, the reality in the wake of the dream is sure to be promising and encouraging.
With the same patriotism in mind, we're to live up to our designated aims ahead -- to embrace HongKong [fm3,-] and still to come, Macao and Taiwan and to better an integret [fm1,-] China all the time.
My Grandmother  My grandmother is a kind peasant woman.
She spends most of her life in the village.
Though she is little [wd3,2-1] educated, she has a good sense.
I used to live with her and my counsins [fm1,-] when I was small because my parents were too busy to look after me .
She takes good care of her grandchildren and gives them every comfort.
They all love her and she loves them also.
My grandmother had too much to do in running a house.
As our family was not wealthy, she had to do everything herself.
She got up the earliest in the morning and sleeped [fm2,-] late at night.
She fed the pigs, chickens, ducks and geese, and watered the vegetables.
She prepared the meals and washed the clothes.
In the harvest season, she must help in the field.
She worked hard yet [wd5,3-2] without complaining.
She is also a thrifty and industrious woman.
She saves every penny as she can.
As she had been [vp6,2-6] busy ever since she was young, she looks older than she really is.
Her face is wrinkled, her hair turns silver white, and some of her teeth become movable [wd3,3-] .
But she works as hard as ever.
Though her grandchildren have grown up and the family condiction [fm1,-] has improved, she refuses to do nothing.
Now she is still raising a group of chickens and planting a patch of vegetable.
Often she says to us, "Work while you work, play while you play.
If you do not work, you will become lazy and of no use.
" What good advice she has given to us!
She had just been [vp6, 3-8] to school for several years but she taugh [fm1,-] us how to act through her experience.
We must live up to it and always keep it in mind.
My Dad  When I began to write this article, I wondered what information I would get from my memory about my father because, sometimes, Dad seemed so strange to me. [sn,s] .
What does my father look like?
Dad was [vp6,7-] one of the most ordinary kind of people with few words.
The deepest impression about him in my mind was [vp6,8-] his always [ad2, 1-2] rough [wd3,-1] face.
In my childhood, I was usually too scared to look [vp1,-1] him in the face.
Each time when we were together, I just wanted to escape from him.
Common as he was, I wouldn't find anything particular about my father to brag before my classmates.
Sometimes I would feel shamed [wd3,3-3] of his ordinariness.
I would ask myself whether I would choose to be his son if I had the chance before I was born.
Also, it seemed that he didn't care about me much and just let me go my own way.
There must be a gap between us, I always thought.
An episode happened and changed my perception [wd3,-] towards dad.
It was just after I had received the notice that I was accepted by Zhongshan University that a banquet was held.
All of my relatives came to congratulate me on it.
At [pp1, -2] that night, I was so surprised to find dad singing songs and talking loudly and excitedly all the time.
He wasn't the one he used to be.
What astonished me most was that father got drunk that night, for as a bus driver, he never drank more than a little glass of beer.
I felt something unusual about dad that night.
It seemed that something which he had hidden in his heart for a long time bursted [fm2,-] out.
And I found the things I had neglected or so many years at [pp1,-2] that night.
I knew he was proud of me, and I was proud to have a father like him as well.
I will be his son.
Forever.
In western countries, there has the first day of Xmas gift shopping the shopping is on all day long, street lights and store windows are decorated with the traditional Xmas colours of red and green.
Families decorate [wd4,2-1] home [wd3,2-3] inside and outside after they had [vp6,8-3] a spring cleaning.
During the time, Xmas tree is very popular because people think it can bring good luck, and then in every home, there is a beautiful Xmas tree decorated with coloured light [np6,9-] .
Sometimes, in many communities there is the costom [fm1,-] of decorating a big Xmas tree for out-door display.
Before the Xmas Eve, most people exchange presents and send Xmas cards to their friends, relatives and bussineers [fm1,-] associate [np6,6-] .
On Xmas Eve or Xmas morning, many families go to Church, then they come home to enjoy a traditional Xmas dinner, which includes turkey, goose, ham, plum pudding, and mince pie, sweets, and so on.
Before going to bed, children hang their stockings by [np7,5-1] fireplace, hoping some sweets and toys will be given by Santa Claus.
At the same time Xmas is also a time for singing.
In [np7,1-1] USA, especially Handel's Xmas choral [fm1,-] music "Messsiah" are [vp3,5-1] heard everywhere during the season over the radio, On [fm3,-] TV or in department stores.
In a word, it is a great occasion for children and all people with emphasis on love, and it is the most pleasant time of the year.
To compare with the western Xmas, the chinese [fm3,-] Spring festival [fm3,-] exists the similar points, [s8,s] it is also the biggest chinese [fm3,-] holiday.
On New Year's eve, each family has a great reunion dinner, and the peak of the celebration activities fall [vp3,6-4] on New Year's Eve and the day after.
For instance, the people will stay up till 12 o'clock, then they will cheer themselves up and burn the firecrackers [cc3,3-] , do some bless for [vp2,4-2] each other, etc.
And on the day after -- New year's Day, all the family members dress in their finest and then go to visit their relatives or friends.
According to [np7,-2] Chinese tradition, making jiaozi (dumplings) on the fifth day of the lunar Calendar will bring good luck in the new year.
Quickly, Spring Festival ends after the traditional Lantern Festival.
On the night of Yuan Xiao, also known as the Lantern Festival, [np7,-2] Chinese custom calls for the display of Lanterns inside or outside of the homes [wd3,5-] , according to [np7,-2] Taoist belief, the Lord of Heaven visits the earth on the Lantern Festival to confer Luck and happiness on those who are morally upright.
After reading all this [pr1,1-1] things above might help you widen your horizon to know more about the western culture and the eastern one.
 [sn,s] .
Galileo  Galileo was born in Pisa, Italy in February, 1564.
He was the famous physicist all over the world when he was 19,he made his first important discovery-the Isochronism of Pendulum, by chance, which is applied today in the measurement of time, the eclipses of the sun, and the movement of the stars.
Galileo had even been a professor of Mathematics in the University of Pisa.
During that time, he challenged the great Aristotle's theories by conducting an experiment regarding the laws of bodies in motion and got the famous theory that two different weights dropped simultaneously from the same height, would fall to the ground at the same time.
While in Padua, Galileo had written a book concerning the movement of heavenly bodies.
He favored Copernicus theory which declared that the earth is [vp6,5-2] a planet which revolves [vp6,8-1] around a fixed sun.
For to do so, he was be delivered to the torture Chamber of Inquisition. [sn,s] .
Although he was compelled to renounce his belief, he didn't give up flighting [wd3,4-3] with the Inquisition untill [fm1,-] he died on January 8, 1642.He left the world he loved far better informed than it was when he entered it.
I'm against the verdict that the boy was not guilty.
First, I believe that what the old man said was true.
It's possible for him to hear the boy say "I'm going to kill you" though the train was roaring over and it's also possible for him to walk to the front door from his bed within 15 seconds.
Nowadays, scientists have proven that in some special situation [np6,2-] , we can show the potential of our physical ability and do something we can not do in usual time [pp2,2-] .
Suppose the boy was about to kill his father, the words "I am going to kill you" should sound more hoarse and terroble [fm1,-] , different from the words "I'll kill you" we said in our daily life.
If the old man did hear the words and then hear the sound of the falling of a body, think of it, it's not a wonder for the old man to get to the front door as quickly as possible to see what had happened.
Secondly, I am still not sure whether the woman weared [fm2,-] her glasses or not when she was tossing and turning.
It's true that people usually don't wear glasses to bed.
But that does not mean there is no exception.
One of my friends often goes to bed, forgetting to put off [vp2,3-2] her glasses, and she often finds that the [np7,13-2] next morning.
What's more, the woman's eyesight has not been examined, and in fact, we have no idea about her exact eyesight situation.
How can we draw the conclusion that she could not see the murderer even if she didn't wear her glasses.
Finally, let's turn to the downward angle of the knife.
They said if the boy had ever used a switch knife, he would never stabbed downward.
But how can we know the boy was experienced with switch knives?
And even if the boy was, since the stabbing probably happen after a struggle, the knife was not necessarily used underhanded.
We can not exclude the possibility that the boy killed his father accidentally in the struggle.
In that case, the angle can be downward.
So, all comes to this: the boy was guilty.
Christmas and the Spring Festival   The Spring Festival in China and the Christmas in USA are both the most [wd4,2-1] festival of the year.
In those days, the people [np6,-4] in the two countries have vacation to celebrate the new year.
And the [np7,-1] Christmas also has a fairy tale to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Chinese and Americans have different cultures.
The Spring Festival and the [np7,-1] Christmas are also different.
In China, the Spring Festival is from December 24 to January 15 next year in lunar calendar.
In those days, people decorated [vp6,19-] the gate with the traditional color of red, especially the red lantern and the couplet with blessing words.
And you will see many kinds of colorful balloons and firecrackers everywhere.
In the United States, the spirit of Christmas arrives about a month before the holiday itself, December 25. ate in November, street lights and store windows are decorated with the traditional Christmas color [np6,-4] of red and green.
Snowmen, Santa Claus, shepherds, angels, and Nativity scenes appear in countless shop windows.
Fir tree [np6,1-2] , holly wreaths, and mistletoe are familiar sights.
Families decorate their homes, inside and out, with colored lights and evergreens.
In [pp1,-2] [np7,-2] Spring Festival, most of the Chinese will go home from other places to have a family reunion.
The whole family will enjoy a big happy dinner which we call a reunion dinner.
It's the most important and happy [aj3,3-] thing to all the Chinese, because we have a most deep [aj3,2-] love to [pp1,1-2] the relatives.
On Christmas, many American families go to church and enjoy a traditional Christmas dinner just like [np7,1-1] Chinese, but I don't think it's [pr1,19-] as important as to the Chinese.
And now more and more people going to church is only for fun. [sn,s] .
Both in the Spring Festival and on Christmas, are children [wd1,10-] the happiest because they can get a lot of gifts.
In American [wd3,1-] , children could receive toys from Santa Claus in their stockings and they exchange gifts with their parents under the Christmas tree.
In China, on the New Year's Day, the children should get up earlier than their parents and kowtow to them, then they can get their lucky money.
Now of course they needn't kowtow.
Besides they can also get money from their grandparents, aunts, [wd4,2-1] uncles.
So in the new year the children are very rich.
They can buy everything they like.
Although the Spring Festival in China is different from the Christmas in US, they are of the same importance to people.
I like the days of [np7,-2] Spring Festival, for I can relax to my heart's content.
Perhaps the Americans have the same feeling with me.
Do you think the art [wd3,-1] course and the science course should be completely separated?
In fact, I don't think so.
The art [wd3,-1] and the science are two different courses, but they connect [vp7,2-3] to each other very much.
The art [wd3,-1] trains people's understanding skill, and the science trains people's logical skill.
However, the understanding and the logical skills are both very important in the art [wd3,2-4] and the science.
In China, from senior [wd4,1-1] school we separate [np7,2-4] art [wd3,2-3] from [np7,3-2] science completely.
I think it's a serious problem.
How to study the art [wd3,4-] and the science, here I have some opion [fm1,-] of my own.
In studying the two different courses, there are resemblances and differences.
The resemblances are such as carefulness, memory, and observation.
Carefulness is the most important in doing everything.
With care, you can distinguish two similar things easily and can find something other people can't see.
So carefulness can improve your memory and observant skill.
Actually good studying methods are all good to the art [wd3,-3] and the science.
However, the art [wd3,1-3] and the science lay particular stress on them [pr1,s-] .
For example the art [wd3, 1-] needs more memory and the science requires more observation; the art [wd3,1-1] students should have more understanding efforts [wd3,1-] and the science students with more logical efforts [wd3,1-] are better.
In studying art [wd3,2-] , you should have more patience because there are a lot of things for you to memorize and most of the things are very similar to each other.
You will confuse them easily unless you rememorize them frequently.
In studying science, there are only some main formulas you should memorize.
Then you should learn to use them to deduct the others.
So if you have a good head for logic, that's very good.
Studying is very flexible.
It's hard to say which method is the best.
Different people study in different ways.
The art [wd3,1-3] and the science are of the same importance to our society.
I believe if we were good at both of them, the society would develope [fm1,-] more quickly, I hope the day is not far away.

But, I have a special night on that day.
 [,s] when [fm3,-] I was ten year [np6,1-] old, I was sent to [wd4,-1] countryside, stayed in [wd3,-] my uncle's.
Approaching the Mid-Autumn Festival, I was still [wd7,6-] happy, but on that night, everything changed.
When my favorite food were [vp3,1-] set on [wd4,1-] table, everybody was ready to enjoy them [pr4,1-] , I was sad at the sight of the moon, because I missed my family very much.
So [wd5,-s] , at [wd5,-s] that night I was thinking about how lonely I was without my family around me to share the food night [wd7,-s] .Even [wd5,-s] tears came into my eyes.
I couldn't tell how sorrow [wd2,-2] I was!
Time flies, that night is still my most memorable d-Autumn Festival night.
I used to enjoy the Mid-autumn Festival night together with my parents.
But [wd5,-s] this year, I don't [fm1,-] .
I have [vp6,-s] stayed in the campus.
Because I have had [vp6,-s] an appointment with a young man with whom I almost fall [vp6,-s] in love.
I was very excited [fm1,-] and a little nervous that night.
I'd never made an appointment with a young man at night before.
I'd never fallen in love with a man before.
On that night, we sat by the west Lake in [pp1,-2] the campus, looking at the bright full moon talking.
We talked about our childhood [np6,1-] , our present life [np6,2-] , our family members and Chinese literature about moon.
To my joy, we are [fm3,-] both keen on Chinese literature and we have [vp6,8-] much in common.
I wished my most memorable Maid-Autumn night [np1,-3] would last for ever.
The Mid-Autumn Festival of this year was the most memorable.
In the past I spent the festival with my family at home.
This year, I had to stay at our university and spent the night with y fellow villagers.
we [fm3,-] got together, talked freely and ate the traditional food.
We talked about experience [np1,-2] of life, experience [np1,-2] of study and almost everything.
The traditional food included moon-cakes [fm1,-] , fruits, peanuts and riversnails.
Spending the whole night with them, I relaxed myself and forgot the burden of my study [np1,3-0] .They all treatly [wd2,-1] me nicely.
I felt as if I had come back home and stayed with my family.
On that night, I enjoyed myself, enjoyed everything.
I will never forget that night --- the most happy [aj3,-1] Mid-Autumn Festival night in my life.
It happened it was also my little niece's birthday.
I decided to spoil her for the particular occation [fm1,-] .
I bought a large splendid delicate [wd4,1-1] birthday cake.
My sister-in-law had a gift for her two [fm1,-] .
It was a surprise, she said.
After having dinner, my family were [vp3,1-] all sitting together watching TV.
My niece looked sad and asked, Don't you think you forget something?
" We pretended not to notice it.
"Oh, yes, I forget to turn off the tap.
" said my mother, smiling, and went to the kitchen.
"Let me help you, mame.
" I excused myself into the kitchen.
Then TWO large birthcake [np3,2-] turned up.
"Happy birthday to you, honey.
" With tears in her eyes, the little thing gave each of us a kiss.
We spent the night joyously, which I will remember forever.
I will never forget that Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
My friends and I went to climb Baiyun Mount to see the lunar eclipse.
it [fm3,-] t was 12 pm and it was time for us to set off.
We planned that we should arrive at the summit of the mount before 1 am.
The bright moon hung in the sky .
The breeze brushed trees as it they were singing pleasant songs.
We were so excited that we climbed up to the top non-stop.
Afterwards we sat down together eating mooncakes and watching the partial lunar eclips [fm1,-] .
When we watched the total lunar eclipse, l we could not help cheering.
We had a good time that night.
It was meaningful for us to see the lunar eclips [fm1,-] at the Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
Everyone has his/her beautiful memory about Mid-Autumn Festival night, for it is such a mice moment for Chinese people [np7,2-] , What's mine?
Mine is eating moon-cake [fm1,-] and fruits and appreciating the round golden moon with my family.
When I was young, I spent 15 such night [np3,2-] at home with [wd4,-s] father, mother, brother and sisters.
At [pp1, -3] that [np3,1-] happy occasion [np3,3-] ) my mama always told us stories about the moon, talks [vp6,6-] about the Moon Goddess.
Every year , the story [np3,2-] was [vp3,1-] different and attractive.
But [wd5,-s] now I will never have such [wd4,4-] chance.My mother parted [wd3,-1] away and I always spend my Mid-Autumn Festival at school .
Oh, My [fm3,-] memorable Mid- autumn [fm1,-] Festival night [np3,3-] )is [vp3,1-] only in my memory.
every [fm3,-] one has spent [wd3,-3] many Mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] [np3,2-] and every one has their mot memorable one [np3, 7-] .
So do I.
My meroble [fm1,-] mid-Autumn [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-] night [fm3,-] is the one of last year.
It was the saddest and happiest one in my life.
why [fm3,-] ?
Because it was the fist time that I didn't spend those [pr1,-1] festival with my family.
I missed them very much and I felt sad.
Fortunately, I made friends with five girls who came from different place [np3,1-] of Guang Dong we [fm3,-] live in the same dormitory.
That night we had a good time together.
We bought many things to eat and played many games.
We sang and danced .
They knew me had strong homesick, so they tried to make me happy by telling a lot of jokes.
I will never forget mid-Autumn [wd6,-] mid-Autumn festival [fm3,-] night in 1996 in my life life.
 [wd6,-] 	Mid-Autumn Festival is one of our Chinese traditional festivals.
People enjoy the festival very much, because almost all the embers of the family will get together and it is always very fun.I like this festival very much , my [fm3,-] most memorable a [wd5,-s] Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the one two years ago.It's [fm1,-] a exception [np7,-1] , for I selebrated [fm1,-] it with my friends near my house , carrying [fm3,-] our lanterns, mooncakes fruit, and [wd5,s-] spent the whole night on the mountain playing games, watching the moon, [wd4,1-1] eating the food.
It's [fm1,-] very fun [wd2,1-] to make a wish under the moonlight.
The most laughable thing was that one of my friend [np3,2-] ate clay , instead of the mooncake,because of the darkness.
We slept for a while untill [fm1,-] dawn.
Then we hurried off the mountain to go to school.
It was very excited [aj4,-s] , and from that night, I realized that friends must share their trouble and joys [np3,-2] .
Watching the changing moon on Mid-Autumn Festival Night is the most wonderful things while tasting delicious food.
I had known that I would have a chance to watch the moon changing from a bright round one to a dark one , on the night [pp1,2-] .
I waited patiently for the appearance of the grant [fm1,-] sight.
at [fm3,-] about 2 'clock, the moon changed into a smaller and smaller NEW MOON.
Suddenly it became a complete [wd2,-1] dark one.
Almost at the same time it became a NEW MOON again.
Little by little it turned [vp1,-s] a round one.
I have ever seen the grant [fm1,-] sight before.
I was very excited at this.
I had a wonderful time and missed [wd3,-s] those delicious food [np3,2-] very much.
I can't [fm1,-] forget that Mid-Autumn Festival night which I spent with my university colleagues.
As a rule, people spend that night with their families, but I have to leave my mice [fm1,-] family for university.
For the first Mid-Autumn Festival at university, we had prepared the delicious fruits and some mooncakes --- the two things we can't [fm1,-] lack for such a traditional festival.
At 8.
00 P. M, we lighted a lantern to keep the evil spirits away.
The most memorable thing during that night was playing charades with my colleagues [wd3,-s] .
From the Family AIbumn [fm1,-] U. S. A. we should [wd3, -1] play American games on such a Chinese traditional festival.
Though not staying with my family at that time, I felt at home because of such a enchanted night.
I'd [fm1,-] never had so memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.
Sometimes thing may go on beyond your belief and thus [wd2,-s] was what happened to me last Mid-Autumn Festival.
Last year, I became a college student.
Needless to say, I felt proud and delighted.
At the same time, I was also scared and a bit down --- I would have to live alone without my family.
As the Festival drew upon, I felt more upset.
I was sitting alone in my room and listening sadly [ad1,1-1] to the noisy and joyous sound [np6,s-] outside that night when there was a knock on the door.
"Who is it?
" I asked.
There was no answer.
I opened the door and could see a box of mooncake [np3,2-] on the doorstep.
I went out looking around, but could see nobody.
Puzzled, I turned back.
To my great surprise, my best friend, Xiaohui, was in the middle of the room.
She had travelled a long way to be with me.
Smiling, she said "Happy Mid- autumn [fm1,-] Festival.
" I will never forget that Mid-Autumn.
My most memorable Autumn Festival Night is the one that just passed.
It's [fm1,-] on Tuesday last week that the Autumn Festival met [wd7,-s] , my [fm3,-] friends and I enjoyed a happy night.
It's [fm1,-] the first Autumn Festival that I spent in college, it's [fm1,-] very special [fm1,-] , I felt.
I followed my friend to her relative's home in order to have a delcious [fm1,-] supper.
Before we arrived there, they had prepared all the dishes, they're [vp6,5-] of many delicious kinds.
We enjoyed the supper and had a very happy time.after [fm3,-] the meal, we can taste many kinds of fruit [np3,2-] ,it's [fm3,-] the most favourite meal that I had in Guangzhou, since [cj1,-s] we can't [vp6,5-] do anything but have meals from dinning hall, and every student complains of these bad meals including me .
After we came back to our dormitory, my roommates and other people who lives [vp3,2-] as [pp1,-3] the same building as we do enjoyed a very very happy night.
we [fm3,-] layed [vp4,-] lanterns together and [wd5,-s] so [wd5,-s] so I can say last Autumn Festival Night is the most unforgettable one!This year's Mid-Autumn Festival gave some memorable things to me , it was a wonderful day.
So [wd5,-s] my [fm3,-] roommates and other new friends were together playing some wonderful and enjoyable games, but the most important thing is that I had chance to get to know new friends.
And [wd5,-s] I could eat my favourite food, such as moon cakes [fm1,-] , fruit, etc.
Although I couldn't [fm1,-] come back to my house always missed my family and my lovely dog.
I could only give my parents a call, but I can't [wd3,-s] feel depressed.
Because I don't [fm1,-] try it [wd7,-s] befor [fm1,-] this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.
Contrary, this day is so wonderful for me.
The beautiful moon was bright, and rose higher and higher.
Having enjoyed ourselves, we started walking back, and arrived at midnight.
August 15th, by Lunar Calendar, is the Chinese traditional festival.
As a rule, the whole family gets together for a happy night.
On that night, you can eat a lot of things, such as mooncakes, fruit, rivernail [fm1,-] , teak [wd7,-s] ect [fm1,-] .
when [fm3,-] I left home, I spent the most lonely Mid-Autumn Festival Night, also it's y most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival.
On that night I ate whatever I want [vp3,4-] to.
After a delicious meal, I'm [vp3,4-] full as the fullmoon.
children were carrying lanterns for fun.
I had no mood in doing that thing.
It was for babies [wd3,-s] , so I sat at my desk le.
Just at that moment I realized I was alone in a strange city.
Imagining the whole family sitting around the table happily, I felt a little upset.
I really missed them all.
Thinking the past time I spent with my former friends, I felt like visiting them.
Unfortunately, It [fm3,-] so happened that they were out.
My loneliness was getting more and more [wd4,-s] , Starrng [fm1,-] at the full moon.
It was my only partner on such a only [fm1,-] Mid-Autumn Festival.
Do you spend your Mid-Autumn Festival Night in The [fm3,-] same way like me?
I always spent [vp6,-s] that night with my family.
We often sat together in front of the house, talking [vp1,-1] everything, eating things, but [wd5,-s] ,on the most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night, I was alone.
On that night I could see the lunar eclipse so I would never forget it.
Around [pp2,-s] midnight, the moon became the roundest and the lightest [wd3,-s] on [pp1,-2] that night.
Later, the moon became darker.
At about one o'clock, the lunar eclipse began, and we could only [wd5,-s] see most part of it, and [wd5,-s] we [fm3,-] could less of it later on.
Almost [ad1,-1] at three 'clock, we could no longer see the moon.
Since we can't [fm1,-] see the next lunar eclipse until sixty-years later, it's [fm1,-] worthy [wd3,-s] seeing it.I can't [fm1,-] forget that night for I have [vp6,2-] the chance of watching it.
I spent most [aj3, 1-] memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night when I was in he junior middle school.
It's [vp6,6-] the first time that I hadn't [vp6,-s] stayed with my family during the Mid-autumn Festival night.
It happened that the day was Saturday, and almost all the residents far away from home stayed in school.I missed my family very much, because it was the traditional festival for Chinese family to stay [wd3, 1-] together.
But [wd5,-s] I was a one and I had no moon-cake [fm1,-] .
TO my surprise, one day students carried their on-cake [fm1,-] and fruits to my dormitory.
I couldn't help crying, because they were so thoughtful and so kind.
That night we played till midnight, singing, dancing and talking.
That night was so pleasurable that I will keep it in my mind for ever.
Mid-Autumn Festival is a Chinese traditional festival.
On that night, children like to go out lighting?
) a beautiful lantern [np3,8-] .
when [fm3,-] I was a little girl, I also liked to [wd4, -1] so with other children in our big yard.
My most memorable Mid-autumn Festival night was the night when I was eight-year [fm1,-] [np3,1-] old.
after [fm3,-] having supper, I went out lighting a lantern which I liked very much.
With my little good friends, I came to the Dongjinag river bank and saw some people playing firecrafts [fm1,-] .
It was so interesting that I was attracted.
Suddenly, a "rocket" flied [fm1,-] to me.
I was frightened and threw away my lantern.
Certainly, it burnt.
Being unable to light a lantern, I returned home crying sadly.
Until my mother promised me to buy a more beautiful one for me the next year did I stop crying.
It was a pity that I couldn't [fm1,-] let my lantern hang in the balcony through that night.
And [wd5,-s] it was so unforgetable and memorable.
The Mid-Autumn Festival night of this year was my most memorable night .
What a beautiful night!
The full moon was hanging high up in the wide sky.
The breeze was blowing gently.
My friends and I brought all kinds of food [np3,2-] , fruit [np3,1-] and cold drink to the lawn, where [pr1,-s] were already full of happy people, to celebrate the special night.
We also bought 2 beautiful lanterns, but one of them was burned a hole because the lighting candle in it was tilted [wd3,-] .
What a pity!
But [wd5,-s] when we saw that, we couldn't laughing [vp6,-s] and thought it was unforgettable.
Moreover, when we opened 2 bottles of Pepsi-Cold, the drink [wd3,-2] in them spurted our faces suddenly, we [fm3,-] looked at each other and convulsed with laughter.
How fun [wd2,1-] it was!
While we were appreciating the most bright [aj3,-1] full moon in this year, we were enjoying all kinds of delicious things we bought [vp6, s] , talking, singing and dancing like any other people.
Then [wd5,-s] we spent a happy night.
For me, it also was my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night.
Last year I entered South China Normal University.
During the first month, I had to have military training, and my family is [vp6,8-] far away from University, so I had to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival night without my parents [wd4,3-] but my roommates for the first time in my life.
It was my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival night.
On that night, after bathing myself, I went to the compus [fm1,-] to enjoy the beautiful, round moon with my roommates.
when [fm3,-] we were walking around, I saw a lot of people strolling and chatting with their families, their children holding a lantern [np3,3-] in their hands laughing or running around them.
I also saw some people sitting on the grassland eating fruit and mooncakes [np6,-s] and enjoying the bright moon.
All of these reminded me of my parents and the happy time I spent with my families [np5,-s] on Mid-Autumn Festival night.
At that time, I had an impulse to cry, but, in the presence of my roommates and other people I tried my best to hold back my tears of sadness.
This was the first time I wasn't [fm1,-] at home on such a special night and had no lanterns, no mooncakes and [cj1,1-1] other special things in season to eat.
what [fm3,-] I had was he happy memories.
I can't forget the mid-Autumn Festival night of 1996.
Last year, I spent a special Mid-Autumn Festival night here.
before [fm3,-] I entered university, I spent all my Mid-autumn [fm3,-] festival [np3,-3] at home.
But last year, I left my parents and enter [vp6,4-] university.
Because my house [wd3,-s] is far way from here and we were having a military training at that time I had to stay here on the Mid-Autumn Festival.
At [pp1,-2] that night, we got two apples each one .
The apples were large and red.
The moon was full and bright.
Roommates [np4,-2] and I went out walking .
Since [wd3,-s] we didn't know each other very well, and still were strange [wd3,-s] to our campus, we had a lovely time.It's [fm1,-] the first time I had spent [vp6,-s] the mid-Autumn Festival with strange classmates instead of my parents.
Also It's [fm1,-] the first step I became inddepent [fm1,-] .
It gave me a special memory.
That's [fm1,-] my most memorable Mid-Autumn Festival Night.
I always spent my Mid-Autumn Festival with my family But this year, I entered the university, I have [vp6,3-] to spend my Mid-Autumn Festival with my friends.
On that night I had a good time.
The moon was very round and bright and the sky was blue.
Our campus was full of laughter.
I was invited to a party with my friends.
We went to the grass-land [fm1,-] to see the beautiful moon.
and [wd5,-s] we [fm3,-] had all kinds of food [np3,2-] food to eat everyone [fm3,-] enjoyed it.
we [fm3,-] talked about the original tradition.
 [fm3,-] we also played games.what [fm3,-] a good time we had!
The last Mid-Autumn Festival night was significant.
There as lunar eclipse in that night.
The moon in [pp2,-2] that night was the highest [wd3,3-] the biggest and the roundest in this centry [fm1,-] .
That lunar eclipse was the most marvelous one of those [pr1,-1] centry [fm1,-] .It appeared at the [wd5,1- 1] mid-night, so he didn't go to bed to [wd3,-s] watch the process [wd7,-s] of it for it was really a good chance.
Before it appeared the lunar eclipse the earth was covered with silver.
The moon was so big, so bright that we could see the palace in it.
After that,more and more [wd7,-2] the moon was eaten, and the earth became darker and darker.
At last, the moon was eaten up, all the world became a piece of dark [cc1,3-] .
We even couldn't see each other.
After a while, the moon struggled to show itself out.
First it looked liked a boat, then half an cake [np7, 1-] [wd4,s-] at last it was a full moon.
The earth was covered with silver again And [fm3,-] we could see each other again.
How fun the last Mid-Autumn Festival night was.
It was unforgetable [fm1,-] .
The Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival I spent this year is [wd4,-1] most memorble [fm1,-] .it [fm3,-] was my first time to spend such a special night leaving home .
At [pp1,-1] night, we had a party on the playground.
We danced, sang, told stories and ate the typical food for this festival--- mooncakes and lots of delicious fruits as we appreciating [vp9,2] the beautiful full moon.
The most unforgettable thing we did in the party was burning firecrackers.
The light that the burning firecrakers [wd3,-s] gave out looked so beautiful in the dark night that we all cheered excitedly.
I enjoyed myself very much at [pp1,-2] that night.
What's [fm1,-] more, I've got got closer with my classmates since that night.
In a word, I will never forget that wonderful Mid-Autumn Festival night.
There was a little difference in this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, because I spent it with my room-mates in Guangzhou far away from myhometown.
at [fm3,-] first, I thought I would be lonely, but I changed my thought at last.
That evening, we enjoyed the moon , singing songs and dancing.
My favorite thing in Mid-Autumn Festival is moon-cakes [fm1,-] , since it is delicious, I like to eat so much at a time.
On that night, I ate too much to eat anything else.
This was the first time I spent the special night without my family, but it is [vp6,9-] really wonderful and memorable, isn't [vp6,5-] it?
I always spend [vp6,-10] my MA [wd7,-1] Festival Night [wd7,-s] with my family.
But this time is the special one, I spent it with my classmates instead.
Since then, it was [vp6,-] the most memorable night for me.
At first, we just stayed at the dormitory eating some food.
Later, we went out to the champus [fm1,-] and decided to play a [np7, 1-] game [np3, -s] .
About fifteen classmates took part in the games we planned.
These games included charades and walking compete [wd2,-1] by tighting [wd2,-2] one foot of one person with that of another, then [cj1, s-] made a pair [wd7, -2] with three feet.SO [wd5,-s] it's difficult for the [wd7,-s] to walk straight.
We always fell down because of uncooperation [fm1,-] .
So [wd5,-s] it made great fun not only to [pp1,-1] ourselves but also to [pp1,-1] the people sitting around us.
Though the games were silly and not fashionable today, we all enjoyed ourselves.
We spent the night, eating , playing and also [wd5,-s] laughing.
The Mid-Autumn Festival night was different this year.
For the first time I spent this night at school.
Because I was missing [vp6,-s] my family.
I was in a little low [wd7,-2] .
Suddenly I heard laughing [wd3,-s] around me.
It was my classmates who were going to have a party.
I joined them.
At [pp1,-2] the playground we talked, singed [fm1,-] and enjoyed the bright , round moon.
The moon-cakes [fm1,-] seemed to be specially delicious because of our happiness.
then [fm3,-] we played charades.
It was the most exciting part of the night.
We forgot he time.
it was almost midnight before we knew it.
This Mid-Autumn Festival night is the most unforgetable [fm1,-] and I'll keep it in my mind for ever.
Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night, in [wd5,-s] this year, is memorable.
It was a special and happy night.
This year I spent the Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night at school instead of at home.
I missed my family and felt lonely.
TO my suprise [fm1,-] , things were not as bad as I had thought.At [pp1,-2] that night many of my classmates and I went out to enjoy the round and bright moon.
We held a happy party.
the [fm3,-] fruits that we brought at [wd5, -] that night.
We played interesting games, such as charades and "two men three feet".
When we played "two men three feet", some pairs [fm1,-] couldn't cooperate well and they almost fell on the ground.
The games made us laughed [vp1,2-] all night.
All of us had a good time.
The Mid Autumn [fm1,-] Festival Night in [wd5, -1] this year will be in my memory for ever.
Mid- [fm1,-] autumn festival is a traditional occasion [wd3,-s] in China.
People attach important [wd2, 1-1] to it.
Before [pp1,-2] several weeks, they prepare for it.
They will visit old friends and relations with moon cakes [fm1,-] moon to keep [wd3,-2] their friendship.
When I as a little girl, my gramma [fm1,-] would tell e the story about the moon.
We sat [vp6,9-] outside and watched [vp6,20-] the moon.
Gramma [fm1-] told [vp6,8-] me that there are [vp3,-1] a beautiful lady whose name is chang'er and her servant Wugang in the moon.
and [wd5, -s] Chang'er is accompanied by a beautiful rabbit.
n ancient [wd4,2-] a beautiful young lady didn't want o get old, so she stole some lixins [fm1,-] and took them [wd4,2-] .
TO her surprise, she became a fairy and flied [fm1,-] to the moon.
Now, he is in charge of the moon.
In id- autumn [fm3,-] festival [fm3,-] , you will see Waging cut a tree and the rabbit superintending [fm1,-] him.
Each time, my gramma told me e same story, but I was attaracted [fm1,-] by it.
There are many memories of Mid-autumn [fm3,-] Festival in my brain [wd3,-s] .but [wd5,-s] the most memorable thing is eating moon cake this year.
You must be surprise.
Why is that?
After supper at [pp1,-2] that night, my family were sitting [vp3,1-] around the table and watching the moon.
we [fm3,-] were happy in [pp1, 1-] eating fruits and having jokes.when [fm3,-] we saw the whole round moon, my father said: " lets [fm1,-] eat moon cake.
" My cousin gave me one.
I was so excited that I ate it immediately.
But I was treated [wd3,-s] .
The moon came [fm1,-] was not [wd4,1-1] usual one, it was made my by [wd1,2-0] cousin.
She put some pepper in it.
Of course, I didn't know [wd4,1-] .
After eating a little, my eyes and nose were running.
Oh, I was liked [wd2,1-2] a clown at that time, red eyes and red nose.
My family laughted [fm1,-] and I laughed too.
Although I was treated [wd7,-s] .
I didn't mind.
It was one of my family's games.
We all like [vp6,8-] to have fun.
I had a happy night in [pp1,-3] Mid-Autumn Festival.
 [np6, -] towards them are vastly different.
People usually have a warm welcome to the birth, while try their best to avoid death.
There is an old saying in China: debt is better than death.
Fortunately, this [np9,-] kinds of views have changed in China.
People now put more emphasis on the quality of life than the merely quantity.
A comparable short, happy life is accepted by many people.
Most of old people don't have the fear for death as they did before.
Many people want to die with dignity and peace.
They don't want to experience a long waiting period before the death.
Instead of the passimistic [fm1,-] waiting, they prefer to the progressive way to die.
Lastly, let [wd4, s] see the feasibility of it.
The social development has enable [vp6,s-] China to pratice [fm1,-] euthanasia.
There is [vp3,1-4] no scientific problems in it.
Modern medicine science can use various methods to maintain the painless of the death.
China also has pratised [fm1,-] in some area.
Apart from all these elements, some people argued [vp6,s-] that the legalized euthanasia may invite abuse.
The unscrupulous persons will take advantage of it and dubbed the murder as "mercy killing".
We have to agree that this is the aspect we should pay attention to In this case, a good law should be introduced to protect the legal euthanasia.
We should ensure that the mercy killing is performed at the patient's request with the consent of his relatives and the signature of a lawyer.
The doctors should have joint approval of all medical personnel attending so that to ensure the patient is really beyond hope.
We can even set up the institutions to supervise the practice.
At the same time, the education on death should be carried out.
Euthanasia should be legalized in China.
It has been considered in various levels, from different angles.
It will be a good news [wd4, s] all the Chinese.
We can not refuse eating because of choking, all the thing [np6, 2-] we need to do is to reduce the bad effects as well as possible.
Thus people and society will get much more benefits than bad effects.
(t8-11) The Gulf War had been [vp6,s-] over for two and a half years.
It will be written into history with its bombards [wd2,2-] thundering and fire burning.
Now it is all over, though [ad1,s-] it will appear in text books to illustrate war theories or middle-east [fm3,-1] policies.
Except that what the war left us is just a memory full of violence and a deep thought --- people are still fighting for their country.
The Gulf War began on January 16, 1991.
It lasted for 42 days, including 38 days' air battle.
The war ended with the multinational army controlling South Kuwait and Iraq.
Tens of thousands of Iraqis were killed.
Both side [np3,1-] have shown [wd3,-] their great courage during the war.
The Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the Amerians [fm1,-] and others, everyone [wd3,s-] fighted [fm2,-] bravely for their own country.
Human history is a long story of conquering and being conquered.
There are always wars, fightings [np5,-] and blood.
The purpose [np6,s-] of fightings [np5,-] are various --- power, freedom, land, resources, religion, and even women.
It is often very difficult to tell which side stands for justice.
But one thing never changes with time [np5,-] or political situation [np6,4-] --- people believe they fight for their country, or their nation.
We can find examples very easily, from the war between antient [fm1,-] Greece and Rome, to World War II, during which faith to homeland was proved to be [wd4,1-2] great power.
It was such power that helped people drive away fascist [np6,s-] which [pr5,s-] had thrived and prospered by destroying everything.
Patriotism comes from love to one's mother.
Mothers give birth to their children and bring them up without any complaint.
Children's love to their mothers is a combination of gratitude, tenderness and faith.
It is a deep feeling from one's heart, so does [wd3,d] love to one's nation.
Human [np3,s-] are social animals.
Everyone has the intention of belonging to a certain community.
They are eager to be accepted by others, so they gathered [vp6,s-] and form tribes, nations, and states.
Nobody wants to be lonely.
It is miserable for people who have no motherland.
They hope to be accepted and protected.
They have to pay for the acception [fm2,-] and protection --- that is, [wd3,s-] love, faith, and dedication to the country.
The Gulf War had been [vp6,s-] over, but other wars are going on and new wars will break out in the future.
We long for peace, or we fight for peace.
There is always contradiction between war and peace.
But one thing is clear: no one will be blamed because of fighting for his country.
(t8-12) Maybe our world wouldn't exit [wd3,s-] if there hadn't ever been wars.
Wars have greatly pushed the society [np4,1-1] advance almost in every respect, especially in science and technology.
On the other hand, wars are doubtlessly nightmares which have brought about countless tragedies.
Then how should we evaluate wars?
And is it still a great thing to fight for one's country?
Usually, it's the conflict between nations that brings out wars.
The conflict [np6,s-] includes boundary problems, nation problems and religious problems, some of which have been hung-up [fm2,2-2] for centuries.
Wars also happen when a country means to conquer the other one such as the Gulf War.
Because war is the quickest way to span a country's territory and obtain large amount of wealth.
A war span varies from a few days to several decades, which depends on the purpose of a war, the military power of both sides and the interference of the third country.
Most People oppose war which they think may destroy the civilised world and cover man's history with humiliation.
Of course, war reprents [fm1,-] the dark-side of the world and indicates the limit of man's mind.
But can we find another better way to solve so many disputes?
Some kinds of disputes can be solved according to laws.
For example, Tom stole Sam's wallet then Sam can report Tom to the police and the court has [wd4,1-3] right to punish Tom.
Tom must submit to the law.
Even if he committed [vp1,-s-] [vp6,s-] to protect [wd3,1-2] the verdict, his individual power is too weak to help him escape.
But as to the countries, there couldn't be a law which has force on all the member countries, because each independant [fm1,-] country has its own social system and no other country has [wd4,1-3] right to manipulate it.
Though we have drawn [wd4,-] several international treaties, still some super nations can break them easily.
At a time, we were proud of the United Nations which was expected to keep the world in order.
But we are disappointed to see that UN's power is still very limited.
The worst thing is that UN was just a political card played by some country in a period.
Then, war turns out to be the only approach to end endless disputes.
It won't disappear until man's spirit reaches to an extremely holly [wd3,2-1] degree.
Once war breaks [wd4,2-] no one can avoid it.
Kuwait would have been diminished by evil Iraq in no time if it had refused to join the war.
Just as we Chinese had to fight back [wd4,2-2] Japanese devils in the second [wd4,s-] war.
All the wars have the same essence but the [wd5,4-2] different forms.
For example, fighting, weapons have been developed greatly since war appeared.
From spear [np6,1-1] sword [np6,2-1] gun [np6,3-1] tank [np6,4-3] to biological weapons, atomic bombs and missiles.
Modern war has put [wd4,s-] emphasis on the sky than on the land.
Hence, Hi-tech has become a key point which can decide the final to a great extent.
Most people oppose war because they're afraid of war.
We Chinese fear war because we're afraid to lose the present peaceless [wd2,2-] We have suffered so much from war that we'd rather the earth were destroyed than war broke [wd4,2-] But the fact is that no country can refuse war if it does come.
You don't mean to fight others but others want to fight you Mao Zedong has such a famous saying: we don't offense [wd2,s-] others until others offense [wd2,1-1] us.
We can't always say war is unjust.
Because on the part of the defence country, war is just.
We call those national heroes who devoted their lives to the defense war and we erect monuments for them.
But we never do so for the dead on the unjust side.
A war doesn't always result in tragedies.
If the bad side is defeated, then the war has pushed the world a step forward.
Fortunately, most of wars ended with the victory of the just side.
It conforms with Mao Zedong's conclusion, "Victory always belongs to justice.
" War is the exterior form of the interior conflict.
Like any other things, war has two sides and no one can avoid it.
It won't disappear as long as human beings are living.
(t9-1) 	When our teacher wrote this topic in [wd3,-2] the blackboard, it aroused a heated dispute among our classmates.
One boy said with regard to either physical strength or intelligence, women are poorer than men, and since the differences are [wd5,3-2] alway [fm1,-] exist, there is not any necessarity [fm1,-] to try to find equality.
Some other boys said that it is impossible to have a [wd5,1-6] real and absolute equality [np5,4-2] in reality.
So we should take the unequality [fm2,-] for granted and feminine movement is just [wd4,2-3] waste of time and strength.
From their point of view, I got a conclusion that feminists are not only necessary but also imperative.
Thinking of feminists, many people would associate it with those extreme radicals, who advocated that females controlled the world and domineered over males.
I don't agree with them, neither [wd3,d] What I believe is that the two genders should treat each other equally, that is, respect each other and understand each other.
There is no doubt that men and women are different.
In fact, every person is different from others.
The [wd5,-2] God endows [vp1,-3] us different appearences [fm2,-] personalities and abilities.
If used properly every person could contribute to the society greatly.
No one or one kind of people is inferior to others.
Women are as intelligent and enterprising as men, evidences can be found all around the world.
Discriminating [vp1,-] women not only harm [vp3,4-] women but also waste [vp3,s-] human resources.
It harms our whole beings.
So I think men who believe he [pr3,6-] is superior to women should learn to respect others, especially women.
The equality, which [wd5,s-] I thought [vp6,s-] is not absolute equality.
It is unrealistic to require that the number of female presidents should be exactly [wd4,1-2] same with [wd3,2-5] the number of male presidents.
What I think is that women should have more oppertunities [fm1,-] in the society, such as in finding jobs promoting, or getting the same salaries.
The oppertunities [fm1,-] also mean that woman [np3,1-5] could have their own choices, that is, if a woman wants to get out and find a job, she should have freedom to do so; If she chooses to stay at home, she would not be accused.
So woman liberation does not necessarily mean all woman [np3,1-1] should go out and find a job, but rather means [vp1,-3] give every women [np3,1-] the opportunity to choose by herself.
After so many years and so many people's struggle, the condition of women has improved greatly.
However, in some area like Asia, the situation is not pessimistic.
Due to the religions and historical influence, women in China are still struggling for living.
Abuseing [fm2,-] women is a common phenomina [fm1,-] [np6,2-] Therefore how can we think feminin [fm1,-] movement is [wd4,1-3] waste of time and useless?
And when will women and men, all the human being [np6,3-] can exist harmonily [fm1,-] and equally?
(t9-2) 	Decades ago, chairman [fm3,-1] Mao, the great leader of Chinese revolution claimed: "Chinese women are half of the sky!
" Decades later, however, Chinese women haven't yet own [vp9,2-] half of the sky.
That Chinese women play an essential and indispensible [fm1,-] role in China can't be denied.
While the western countries launched overall women liberation campaign [np6,4-] China, also put foward [fm1,-] laws to protect women's rights.
It's women's legal rights to enjoy equality with men socially, politically and economically.
However, it's not totally true in reality.
According to statistics, only 26% [wd4,-2] government official [np6,3-] are women.
Though women do [wd3,s-] phyiscally [fm1,-] weaker than men, they are no weaker in intelligence.
Unfortunately, men chavvinism [fm1,-] pervades.
A lot of people have a prejudice that women are unsuitable for management or politicis [fm1,-] Men chavvinist [fm1,-] [np6,-1] revel in seeing wife [np6,2-2] cooking, washing [wd4,5-4] doing all house chores in the kitchen while husband [np6,s-] sitting comfortably and lesurely [fm1,-] watching TV.
And when a woman show [vp3,3-] talent in managing, she is unlikely to be promoted, since the boss (usually they [pr3,s-] are male) are [vp3,s-] skeptical about women's ability.
The root of men chavvinism [fm1,-] is China's long feudal thinking influence.
Though China has been liberated for more than forty years, feudal idea still exists.
The Confucius's three cardinal principles are still obeyed by many Chinese especially those in rural areas.
Confucins [fm1,-1] proposed "husband [np6,-2] guide wife [np6,2-] " and "women's virtue".
Women's virtue means " [wd4,s-] wife [np6,s-] is subordinate to [wd4,s-] husband [np6,s-] and at [wd4,1-2] husband's [np6,1-1] disposal.
" So, when a women [np3,1-] excels, even nowadays, a lot of people still tend to consider her an unprincipled women [np3,2-] Since [wd5,s-] according to women's virtue, a female shouldn't go beyond home, insteadly [fm2,-] their [pr3,s-] duties are doing homework and waitting [fm2,-] on [pp1,-1] husbands.
To go to work and show yourself will be considered as immoral.
These old ethnical [wd3,d] codes if not possess [wd1,2-s-] a dominant part, at least [wd4,s-] a considerable place in many people's minds 	I can give you an example.
This year, a foreign trade company askes [fm2,-] for five graduate [np3,1-] in our institute.
Their condition is simple: just five boys.
Naturally, the institute doesn't agree.
They want to make a bargain: How about three boys and two girls.
(By the way, the two girls' academic mark is much better than boys') The company turned down firmly: "Even if you give us four boys and one girl, we wouldn't accept.
Just five boys, otherwise, we would go for [wd3,1-1] another college.
" It sounds somekind [wd2,-] ridiculous.
The company's reason is quite straightforward: "Women are weaker both in body and in intelligence.
What's more, women will have birth and they'll have vacation.
It's uneconomic for us to employ girl students.
" That's cruel reality, women's ability aren't [vp3,2-] universially [fm1,-] acknowledged.
It's said Chinese women's social status is [wd4,1-1] highest [aj3,1-1] in the world.
Chinese government even put [vp3,s-] high priority in [wd3,1-2] women issues.
While the women's liberation organization play [vp3,4-] increasingly important role [np6,2-1] in western countries.
I call on Chinese women become [vp4,s-] more conscions [fm1,-] [aj2,-1] about themselves.
Since the reason of the present unequality [fm2,-] not only go [vp3,5-] to men, but also resides in women's part 	Some Chinese women is [vp3,3-] greatly influenced by conficusism [fm1,-] They take it for granted that women should stay at home, and it's no good for a women [np3,1-] to go to work and become [wd4,1-1] focus.
Once I was asked by a girl: "What's your criteria for boyfriend [np6,1-] ?
" I answered directly: "If we love each other.
" She was surprised: "What if your boyfriend [wd4,3-2] a worker?
" "What does that matter?
" She told me professionally: "Men should excel women.
They can't marry a woman whose background [cc4,-4] and degree [wd4,s-] higher than themselves " At that time, I realized how deep [wd2,s-] the "women's virtue" effects [vp1,s-] [vp6,s-] 	Today, Chinese women enjoy more and more rights and their legal rights are respected.
However, it's still time for us to say that they've own [vp9,1-] half the sky.
They haven't yet own [vp9,1-] half of the sky.
Therefore, I propose feminist [np6,2-5] would do good to women.
(t9-3) 	Nowadays, women's status in many aspects has been elevated.
This is attributed a lot [wd5,s-] to the women's liberation.
Feminists have done a great deal [wd4,2-3] good rather than harm to the cause of women.
The most outstanding goal of feminists is struggling for the equality with men in the fields of economic [wd2,4-] political [wd2,5-] and social [wd2,4-] Their efforts have been proven very helpful to improve the women's status, especially in the first and the last field [np6,6-] 	In the economic field.
For centuries, the women's economic position was at the bottom of the heap.
Women used to stay at home, taking care of the children, cooking, washing and doing all others [wd3,1-2] kinds of houseworking [fm2,-] They didn't go out for work to earn their own living.
The family economy depends on men.
For that, men thought that women must be very grateful to them.
Eventually, men had the sense of superiority, for "it is us to feed you.
you can't live on without us.
" So, "negligible" is the only word occured [fm2,-] to them when women expressed their opinions and wills.
One can see how insignificant women's post is both in family and society because of their economic dependence.
"Walk out of the kitchen!
" is what feminists call for the women.
They encourage women go [vp4,s-] out to work, to be independent [aj2,-1] to men in finance so that they can be themselves since they do have to "take men's opinions too seriously.
" 	In addition, it is not unusual that women's income is lower than men's.
Feminists fight against this not only because it is a [np7,-1] economic inequality, but also because it is a social standing's inequality.
In the social field.
Feminists demand that women must have the same chances as men of education, job, social activities, etc.
They are in opposition to the sex discrimination in work and insist that women must have the same wage with men of [pp1,2-] same job.
There are many other goals feminists fight for, such as seeking the political equality, preserving women from family violence and sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place [np6,2-] against pornaghapha [fm1,-] and using women in advertisment [fm1,-] for example, just recently, some university students held the demonstration against "the Miss Hong Kong Contest", appealing for preserving women's dignity, stopping selecting beauty.
In conclusion, feminists play a very important role in improving women's status, they have done a great deal [wd4,2-3] good to women, and will continue to [wd3,1-2] their jobs more efficiently.
(t9-4) 	If you open Bible, you will read about the myth of Eva's creation from Adam's rib.
In ancient China's moral codes, there were three virtue guides, among them was "Husband [np6,-2] guides wife [np6,2-] ".
For centuries, Chinese women were confined in their fathers' and later their husbands' houses, taking care of domestic chores, seldom went out, not to mention working equally with men.
Women in Islamic countries have to wear long gowns and thick veil outside their houses.
Even today their education and profession aren't encouraged.
Women in Japan, Korea and Taiwan seldom go out to work even though lots of them have received university education.
In human's long history, women were undisputably [fm2,-] placed on a submissive and inferior position.
Even in the modern society of the 20th century, unfair treatments of women are still very common.
Concerning women's education, for example, many schoolaged [fm2,-] daughters of poor peasants are kept in the house, helping with the housework, in order to save money to sent their brothers to school.
Some people hold the false idea that girls are slower than boys in academic study and consider it a waste of money to send them to school, esp.
higher educational institutes.
The misunderstanding and discrimination of women even exist in universities and colleges.
Most college admissions officers admit that freshmen women enter with higher marks and better high school records than freshmen men, as if because [wd5,s-] only the best-prepared girls are encouraged to try for college.
When fewer women make the grade in academic life, their smaller numbers are taken to mean that they don't want to or are not capable of finishing complicated academic study.
Women have a harder time than men when they are into the job market.
Our institute as well as thousands of other universities and colleges in China face [vp3,12-] a big problem of assigning female graduates to working units.
Companies think women are troublesome for their long period of conception and child rearing.
Because of family pressure, women are usually not as active and ambitious as their men counter-parts in work.
As a result, there is a prevailing view in the society that women are home-oriented while men are career-oriented.
More chances of promotion are given to men instead of their female colleages [fm1,-] who may have the same or even better ability of fitting the post.
Christine Craft, a Kansas TV anchor earned $38,500 a year, half of her male co-anchor's $75,000 salary [cc4,1-] Even so, her boss once said to her, "you are too old, too unattractive, and not sufficiently deferential to men".
As to "not sufficiently deferential to men", the boss continued to explain, "You don't play second fiddle to your male co-anchors, you don't hide your intelligence to make the guys look smarter.
" In this case, the female anchor was unfairly paid.
Worse than that, she wasn't able to keep her job for she's too outstanding, too intelligent and she even took the leading role from men.
Generally speaking, the society has a wrong expect [wd2,2-2] of women, it see [vp3,1-] women as the genre dependent on men to make decisions both at home and at job, staying at home taking care of the family, sacrificing their creativity in return [pp2,s-] of marital harmony.
It also sets a fix [wd2,2-1] standard of how a woman should be: it is not necessary for her to receive as much education as man, she doesn't have to work as hard either.
As a result, many women are kept at home, and many career women are treated unfairly.
Women's liberation movement is the result of these injusice [fm1,-] and misunderstanding.
The movement includes persuading, protesting and education, hoping to wake up human race from its false tradition, help them, esp.
women, to understand the essence of the status quo.
Its goal is to achieve women's public and political identities seperate [fm1,-] from that of their husbands, as well as their freedom to lead the kind of life of their own choice.
Enthusiasts of women's lib write articles, make statements to enlighten the masses, pointing out the unfairness.
In treating of women's role in the family, they hold that it is not correct to assume that women are better at detailed work simply because that is the work they customarily do.
While talking about women at jobs, they agree that differences exist between the two sexes, but these shouldn't be the reason to exclude women from well- paying jobs or keep them in inferior positions.
They are strongly for the equal status among all human beings, women and men.
The two sexes should have equal chances in education, job and home decision, and they should coorperate [fm1,-] in all these aspects.
Mainly, their points of views are correct and means, suitable.
Though there are some radical actions, they can't represent the whole.
So, forward [wd3,-] women's lib!
During more than of [wd5,2-3] a century of your struggle history [cc1,1-] great changes have taken place.
Laws of women protection are promogated [fm1,-] in countries all over the world.
Men are better estimating their old and new relations with women.
While the most important of all woman [np3,s-s-] have gradually stand [vp9,3-] up and are ready to defend their legal rights.
They go out of their home where they have been tied to for thousands of years.
They receive better education, have jobs and have more chances to see the world.
In a word, they are trying to act as an equal social force as men.
However, any change can be bitter and hard to procede [fm1,-] So never stop, women's lib.
Forward [wd3,-] to stop the unfairness!
Forward [wd3,-] to free the men from the burden of supporting psychic [np6,2-] [wd7,s-] as well as financial dependents!
Forward [wd3,-] to give women true happiness to embrace their own fate [wd7,s-] !
Forward [wd3,-] to achieve eternal human harmony between the two sexes!
Forward [wd3,-] women's lib!
(t9-5) 	No longer was it possible to operate on the assumption that most women would spend the majority of their lives tending the home or taking care of children.
That experience are [vp3,2-] now the exception rather than the rule.
By the end of the 1960s the women's movement had succeeded in challening [fm1,-] nearly all traditional cultural assumptions about women's proper place.
They challenge employment discrimination, bias against women in politics, and the antifemale [fm1,-] prejudice so dominant in the country's major economic and social institutions.
They also fight for [wd4,1-2] repeal for [wd5,2-3] of abortion laws, provide support for alternative life-styles, and, above all, raise the consciousness of women to the cultural bondage of being categorized as a sex object.
The social struggles of the feminist movement had clearly produced far-reaching and impressive gains.
Therefore, in my opinion, feminists have done more good to the cause of women than harm.
We can analyse the reasons from five aspects.
In the first place, political discourse and behaviour also reflected the impact of changing gender roles.
In America, though the administration of Ronald Reagan consistently adopted positions [wd4,2-3] anathema of [cc1,1-1] feminists, the same administration appointed the first woman justice of the United States Supreme Court, named two women to the cabinet, and claimed to be more committed to women's rights than any previous administration.
In [wd3,-3] the influence of the movement, the quantity of women in employment has been increasing.
The distribution of women in jobs historically defined as exclusively male also showed substantial change.
In the second place, massive changes had occured [fm2,-] in family life.
Because of the faminists' [fm1,-] effort, the family violence is decreased sharply by public opinion.
Partly as an indication of all these social shifts, the family also changed dramatically.
The shifts in family composition also testified, at least in part, to "new rules" governing attitudes toward sex, self-fulfillment, and gender roles.
Also because of the faminists' [fm1,-] effort, informed by changing attitudes [wd7,s-] toward individual fulfillment, hundreds of thousands of young women have charted a new course for themselves, [wd4,s-] free of many of the constraints that in the past had assigned women to prescribed roles.
In the third place, the professional women appeal to stop the sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place.
The standpoint indicates that the woman is not a plaything.
According to this, many governments begin to pay attention to the woman's position in work and try their best to decrease the sexual harassment.
Even in the army, American government will punish the man who does the sexual harassment to a woman.
On the other hand, the prostituting [vp1,1-1] is publicized [vp1,3-3] an illegal thing to prevent the porn trade from developing in many countries.
In the forth [fm1,-] place, the women fight for [wd4,1-2] repeal of abortion laws and the freedom of lesbian (of course, it is not suitable in China).
They think it can improve human rights for everyone.
In the fifth place, Many [fm3,s-] women are against [pp1,s-] they are used as a model in advertisment [fm1,-] In fact, it is useful for the employers to improve their goods' quality.
Many employers only like to use the beautiful women to attract the customers.
Sometimes it is effective, but if your quality is not good, you still will lose the customers.
If the employers decrease [vp1,-4] to use the models and improve the quality to attract the customers, it is a good thing for society.
Clearly, enormous changes have occured [fm2,-] both in the daily experience and in the cultural norms describing masculinity and femininity in society.
The changes appear almost revolutionary in dimension [np6,6-] But it was [vp6,d] too early to conclude that dramatic progress toward equality had taken [vp6,s-] [cc2,s-] place.
Therefore, at last I appeal to everyone in society to participate [wd4,-] the feminist movement which heigtens [fm1,-] the women's positions.
(t9-6) 	One prominent and controvercial [fm1,-] campaign of this century is the feminist campaign.
The Feminists, with their awakening consciousness of the women's value and human dignity, call for the equality of women with men in terms of economy, politic [wd2,1-2] social role [np6,3-3] and other aspects.
The most emphasized and first demanded equality is about the job.
It comes into [wd4,3-2] feminists [np4,-1] mind that women have always been in a discriminated position in [wd4,1-3] access to job [np6,2-] Firstly it's difficult for them to get a job.
Many companies would rather employ a man even [wd4,s-] his ability is much lower than the female applicant.
Secondly, if the women are finally employed, their salary [np3,1-1] are pretty lower than her [pr3,s-] male colleagues though they do the same kind of work.
Therefore, what the feminists want is the equality that both women and men should stand on the fair ground of competition and that no discrimination should be exercised.
Another proposition [np1,1-3] to protect women from [wd3,s-] the feminists is to curb the ill-treatment towards women.
One is worsening sexual harassment in work places by their bosses.
In the world where male [np3,-1] dominate almost all the enterprises, women, as their subsidiaries are in a very disadvantage [wd2,2-1] state.
It's rather frequent that female [np3,s-] suffer from the harassment from their bosses phisically [fm1,-] and spiritually.
Those who refuse will probably be fired or have no chance of promotion.
The other is the family violence.
Plenty of women stay at home, caring for the house and the children while [cj1,s-] financially rely [vp5,s-] on their husbands.
So, when they are battered by husbands, they are in very negative position for they have no financial support in [wd3,3-2] their back, so they may possibly submitted [vp9,2-] this, would reverse to worsen their situations.
The call for political equalty [fm1,-] is may be [fm2,1-] the most fundamental and significant one.
Because the equality on other aspects such as economy and social role are embodied and consolidated by political right.
Women won their right for vote in the near [wd7,2-1] 1970s.
Today, they are taking [wd4,2-3] more active part in more fields of the social life.
Some have taken up posts in government, and some even became the governmen [fm1,-] chief [np3,s-] like Mrs. Thather.
Apart from the above, feminists also appeal for other rights like abortion and lesbian.
In my opinion, a large portion of the feminists [np4,1-1] propositions are [vp3,s-] sound and useful.
They serve as pioneer [np3,3-] and ice-breaker [np3,5-] which [pr5,s-] run on the first front in the battle against the unfair social convention.
And, as a consequence, [wd4,s-] will surely bring about the bright future for the women, even, the whole human society.
However, the feminists are [wd5,2-3] also tend to be too radical in some aspects.
For examples [pp2,1-] some feminists tend to be hateful and inappropriately associate anything with the illtreatment [fm1,-] of women.
Like [wd5,s-] some suggest that all the words with "man", like "human, mankind," should have relevant "huwoman [fm1,-] womankind" in a way of equality.
These, are too extreme, because language is the result of remote history and are only signals.
Some suggest that women should be as hard and rough as men and that there should be no womanly gentle [wd2,s-] which is another kind of extreme [np6,1-] 	To sum up, feminists have contributed a great deal to the good of women.
Tribute should go to them except that they should be more objective and moderate on some terms [wd7,s-] 
(t9-7) 	According to some reports of newspaper, nowadays, more and more Battered Women Shelters are established in the world, with the purpose to give some help to the women who have suffered bad treatmeat [fm1,-] of their husbands.
Obviously women and men have still not been equal, women are still not liberated.
No wonder a crusade for women's right becomes more and more thriving.
Though the slogan --- men and women are equal --- has been shouted for years, unequality [fm2,-] between men and women still exists on [wd3,s-] many aspects.
For example, the graduate distribution [wd7,s-] which has to be faced by most of the university students, has become a headache to girls.
Since many companies just prefer to accept males as their staffs [np6,s-] girls stand little chance for jobs.
Graduate distribution [wd7,s-] falls into the one in which only sex is important but not students' capacity or achievement.
This also provides a reason why boys' marks in their study are alway [fm1,-] lower than girls in most universities.
For no matter how low the boys have got the marks they are the first choices to many companies.
What an unfair world!
Battered Women Shelter, which is mentioned at the very beginning, reveals another serious problem in our society.
Traditional custom which requires women to give up their careers and go back home taking care of the family while their husbands devote themselves into their careers, confines many women to their housework.
According to a book named "See U.S. from the University", we get to know that many female M.A.
 [wd4,3-] even PH.D, [wd4,5-] in U.S. universities, have to leave their careers when they are married for they have to provide a good environment for [wd4,1-2] husbands' study.
Couples like Mr. and Mrs. Curie are not easy to be seen.
What a waste of such females' good brains!
From these, we can see that movement for women's rights is necessary for improving the females' social standards.
In order to change the unequal situation I suggest that feminist [np6,1-1] can do something like the followings [np6,1-] : 	Firstly, we can rely on the publicization [fm2,-] Since nowadays there are still quite a lot of people do not realize the disadvantage [wd2,1-1] condition that women are standing in, publicization [fm2,-] seems very important.
Feminists can give lectures to the public and let [vp1,-3] people aware of the existing unequality [fm2,-] in addition, feminists can set up some schools for women, just to teach them how to protect themselves by the way of law, for a lot of women just accept their fates when they suffer bad treatment.
Secondly, feminists can urge the goverments [fm1,-] to set up some practical laws for women's rights.
Most companies, for instant [wd3,1-] do not want to accept females as their staffs [np6,s-] One reason I suggested is that they have to pay the salary to women who are going to bear children and could not work.
Thus, I think that the company of the husband and that of the wife can share [vp1,-4] to pay the salary.
Governments should set up some laws about that.
If such laws really put [vp7,s-] into use, women's rights can make [np7,-2] great stride.
 [cc2,s-] 	We are anxious to see any practical improvements for women's rights are [wd4,s-] coming soon.
(t9-8) 	Human [wd3,s-] is divided into two parts: Man and woman, [wd4,s-] each plays an important role in this world.
But are they equal?
Absolutely not.
Thus there comes [vp3,s-] women's liberation compaign [fm1,-] and Feminists, who struggle for the equality with men in the Man-chauvinism [cc1,-] world.
Yet someone said: "Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
" Is that true?
To answer this question, we'd better have a look at the situations now.
From newspapers, we heard from time to time about the cruel husbands and battered wives and all kinds of unfairness towards women.
Even in China where others believe women are equal to men, things is [vp3,1-] actually not so ideal.
Though the government has stressed many times that men and women are equals, and we often say "women are half of the world".
There are always people who just neglect all these.
For example, when a [np7,-1] enterprise goes headhiking [fm2,-] it would not hire you no matter how competent you are because you are a woman.
It would rather hire a men [np3,1-] less competent.
Such kind of phenominon [fm1,-] are [vp3,4-] not uncommon in China.
This is the reality facing Chinese women and women in other countries as well.
So we need a compaign [fm1,-] a reform urgently.
Answering this need, Feminists appeared.
So what have they done?
Women's Liberation Movement emerged in 1960s.
It is not a long history.
Yet the Feminists have done a lot: they persued [fm1,-] equality with men in economy, in society and in politics; they protested against sexual harassement [fm1,-] in work place; they helped women who were victims of family violence; they opposed porn industries.
Above all, they have waken up the consciousness of women in the world about the serious matter, and lead the struggle for a better world.
Now we can say "no" to the previous question.
Perhaps, there exist some unproper [fm2,-] or overdone actions.
For instance, some Feminists suggested [vp1,-3] to change "history" into "herstory".
I don't think this would do any good and situation wouldn't change because of this simple change of words.
We need more practical action rather than such formality.
But comparing [vp5,-s-] to the good they have done, these overdones [fm2,-] are minor, and can be neglected.
In conclusion, Feminists have done more good than harm.
Only man-chauvinist [np3,s-] considering their shaking position, will say bad words against Women's Liberation Movement.
(t9-9) 	Feminism is no longer a new concept to people nowadays.
The feminist [np3,s-] commenced their actions since the beginning of this century, in less than 100 years, the movement has influenced a fairly large part of the world.
Advocators and fighters of feminism make every effort to realise women's equality with men, which is women's great ideal for centuries.
They strive for their aim in almost every field of modern society: equality in economics, in politics and in social aspect; self-determination on matters varied [vp5,s-] from sexual [wd2,1-] to abortion and advertisment [fm1,-] 	Feminism does obtain sweet [cc4,-1] success in the fields as was [vp3,s-] stated above.
In most western counties, series of laws and regulations have been made and put forth to protect women's legal rights.
Special allowances also have been legally set for them; women's social estate has been greatly improved and their status in education, employment as well as in politics and economics have [vp3,s-] been greatly bettered.
Anyway, feminists in Britain and America, perhaps because of their too [cc4,-2] serious eagerness for their ideal, seemingly have gone to extremes in these years.
One of their famous demands is the legal and social acknowledgement for lesbian, even if this demand could be regarded as understoodable [fm2,-] how can people accept their calls of equality in Porn?
It's so ridiculous and absurd, no wonder that there are someone [np3,1-2] who say that feminists have done more harm, to the cause of women than good.
People can't help thinking whether if [wd5,s-] the feminism will change this which is called "man chauvinist" society to a "women [np3,1-] chauvinist" one?
But if we turn to the rest of the world, the situation is quite different.
In those areas, the voice of feminism is weak [wd4,s-] even soundless: 	Koran, the Bible of lslum [fm1,-] rules the society of [wd4,1-2] lslum [fm1,-] world.
In countries such as lran, lraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, commandments and precepts on Koran direct people's thought and made [vp6,s-] the society a complete man-absolution [fm2,-] one.
Those strict rules not only forbid women to involve in politics and economics, but also inhibit them from taking part in the usual social activities: Women are always on [wd3,-1] unemployment, women are not allowed to walk on street or show up in any public place without their black veils, women are not permitted to talk to strangers....
I wonder how's the feeling of the women [wd1,s-] there.
Have they ever thought or heard of feminism?
Have the conception of equality with men ever came [vp9,8-] into their mind?
Personally I hope there is a day they'll become aware of this and try their best to change it.
Generally, East Asia is another region which the feminist should pay attention to (China is an exception, in this anciently historied [fm2,-] country, everything is under the doctrine of mean.
We haven't yet find [vp9,3-] any need for feminism presently).
In Japan and South Korea both of which have been deeply affected by Confucianism in social psychology, women's social estate is "traditionally" rather lower.
Man-superiority has got deep roots in the society, man is the master both in and out of the home, man is responsible for all social intercourses [np5,-] man is the only back-bone of the family, man makes lives [wd3,1-5] for his wife and children.... while the woman is destined to play the role of wife to husband, mother to children and servant in the house; few chances are provided for women to develop their own career.
A rather popular saying may tell us something elusive: "Japanese women are the most submissive wives on the world".
Although feminism has been exerting its influence in the two countries, the achievement is little.
(t9-10) 	Do feminists and women benefit from feminism greatly?
Do they suffer from it?
What target do those feminist [np3,1-] want to reach?
And what is the specific definition of feminism?
Perhaps, the first feminist's motive is pure [wd2,1-2] for promoting [vp1,-3] women to struggle for their social statue [wd3,s-] But, there is one important point which the first feminist neglected, that is, she and her followers did not give a definition for feminism, at least did not give a strict definition.
That is why the feminism caused so many serious problems later.
This is the root.
As we all know, everything should have their own place for moving.
It is necessary to limit their own activities in the place and it is seldom allowed to go beyond.
For instance, army men should do things according to military rules; human beings should obey the law of nature, otherwise, they are punished.
The feminists now just met the unforturnate [fm1,-] condition.
Men and women are completely different.
It is impossible to win the equality between them in all fields.
I don't mean women should always follow men in every field.
I mean women can do as good [ad2,2-] as men, or better than men in some fields, but not [wd4,s-2] all fields.
In fact, feminists want to surpass men in every fields [np3,1-] they even want to place themselves over men.
This surely caused [vp6,s-] many serious problems, which are difficult to solve, even for those feminists.
As to the equality with men, the society has offered equal opportunity for both men and women.
In this condition, women and feminists should take effort in improving their own ability in order to contest with man.
In most cases, feminists don't do like that.
They just call on those women to quarrel with men for equality.
It is very difficult to get same salary, same number of officials in govermental [fm1,-] institutions, because the women don't have enough ability, although they have enough energy.
Feminism is also one of the reasons caused [vp5,s-] family violent [wd2,2-] We know, most feminists are female.
To those married female feminists, the most direct struggling action is to ask for equal rights in family.
In most cases, men give what they want to show their generosity, while in some family [np3,2-] the number of this kind of family [np6,3-] is not small, husbands can't stand the feminists' excessive demand.
Of course, it's not only the feminists' thing [wd7,2-] men also should be responsible for it.
Here, I just point out, feminism is one of the reasons caused [bp5,s-] family violent [wd2,2-] 	Furthermore, [wd4,s-] sexual problem has been becoming more and more serious since the feminism appeared, such as, sexual harrasment [fm1,-] in work, porn, abortion, Ads [fm1,4-2] for women and its bad affection, homosexuality, etc.
I don't know why all these things developed so quickly since then.
Because I'm writing about feminism, so [wd5,s-] I have to think that's some feminists go beyond their legal sope [fm1,-] and partly caused [vp6,s-] these problems.
Why don't those Islam countries have these problems?
It is because the women in these countries just do women's own things.
They are in their legal scope.
All in all, feminists should take effort in improving women's own ability so that they can enlarge their legal scope gradually.
Feminism now really do [vp3,3-] harm to women, except feminists give a strict definition to the term of feminism from now.
(t9-11) 	"Should men and women be equal?
" This is a question much discussed by people all over the world today.
Many say that men and women should not be regarded as equal, because many things men do could not be done by women.
They say that men have always shouldered the responsibility of protecting women, therefore men are stronger than women and should have more right than women.
From a certain point of view, these remarks may sound reasonable.
But take [vp4,s-] everything into consideration, one must consider men and women equal.
Nowadays, many things done by men are done also by women, which is, to some extend [pp2,2-] attributed to the feminists' struggle for the equality of women.
Women are playing an increasingly important role in society today.
Having repeatedly demonstrated ability in roles traditionally held by men, they are showing just how much they can contribute.
No longer can it be said that women's place is only in the home raising children and keeping house.
Women have now walked out of the kitch [fm1,-] Throughout [wd4,1-1] society, capable women are proving that they are valuable to the communities.
But some say that it's the women's liberation that makes women's situation worse.
They argue that it is too much for women to work full-time outside the home and take care of home as well.
As a matter of fact, this argument is groundless at all.
With the changes in their social role, women's position in the family has been improved as well.
The wife no longer is obedient to her husband but, instead, exerts an influence on the children and family affairs equal to that of the husband.
Morer [fm1,-] the husband must now assume some of the responsibilities of maintaining a household such as cooking, cleaning and other such job around the house.
Although China was once a deeply rooted feudal countrony [fm1,-] great changes of women's social position have taken place.
A numerber [fm1,-] of social trends are combining to produce a unique shift in family relationship.
The idea of a man doing all the housework was little thought of as laughable.
There is a revolution in sex-roles.
In some big cities, an increasing number of two-parent families have a woman as the source of income as well as the husband, although some poor rural areas [cc2,-s-] are still prevailling [fm2,-] the traditional pattern of men working outside while women staying at home.
It is less embarrassed [aj4,3-3] about the situation that the father shoulders part of the houshold [fm1,-] chores.
In this case, we say, working outside while taking care of the family, the wife benefits a lot.
Firstly, the wife is independent economically.
She'll be subject to nobody.
Secondly, when working, she'll meet with people from all walks of life and tackle various problems, even some hard ones, also she can learn a lot from her job, which will strengthen her will and wider [wd2,s-] her field of vision.
Thirdly, if she just stays at home to do house work and take care of her children, she'll gradually feel life is so dull that she'll be tired of it.
Occasionally, she'll be in a bad mood, which is not good for the family.
In conclusion, women's liberation raises women's social position and cause [vp3,s-] a variety of changes in interpersonal relationship within a family, which is good to women, but not does harm to women.
(t9-12) 	A famous Chinese saying "Women can hold up half of the sky" can mostly portray the situation of Chinese women in present days.
It is true that Chinese women can enjoy more priviledge [fm1,-] than women in the western society, but things are not always the case.
Before 1949, women were at the bottom of the society.
Discrimination can be reflected from many aspects.
In characters, most Chinese character [np3,2-] with 'nu' (meaning women) as their components [np6,s-] mean evil qualities of mankind, such as 'greed' and 'wicked'.
Even Confusuis [fm1,-] the blilliant [fm1,-] thinker and educator held that "women and villains are untrustworthy".
In a man-chauvinist country like old China, women could not keep their own names at the moment they were married.
Shortly after liberation, over 90% of the female grown-up [np3,5-] were illeterate [fm1,-] [np3,s-] or semi-illelerates [fm1,-] owing to the fact that only men can learn [vp1,-3] read and write in the old time because in the traditional concept only men can carry on the family name, they deserved all the privillege [fm1,-] in the society.
During the four decades after liberation, China has seen conspicuous improvement in women's social status.
First of all, from central government to township faculty, "Women's Federation [np3,1-1] " are set up to deal with women problems specifically, such as family violence, women abuse, child abuse etc.
It is owing to this organization that China sees fewer problems with sex-discrimination than most Westen [fm1,-] countries.
It is also for this organization of this organization [wd7,s-] that the privilege and equality are trickling down to Chinese women.
The constitution stipulated that women should gain equal job opportunity as men.
Most urban families, consequently, have the wives as one of their bread-earners.
The history has ceased of Chinese women wearing their husband's family names before their own.
Chinese husbands can be attributed to this great success for their lenience and kindness.
There is also a slang to call the hen-pecked husband "Qi Guan Yan" (literally [wd4,s-] means tracheitis [fm1,-] while pronoucingly [fm2,-] similar to "wife controls tight").
Most Chinese husbands don't feel ashamed of the nickname.
Why should they?
If being called "Qi Guan Yan" means more respects are being paid to the wives in families why should the husbands [np3,s-] concern so much about his face, since a society, any society can not be regarded as a highly civilized one unless enough attention and respects are being paid to women.
Chinese success does not mean it [pr1,s-] has achieved enough to rest.
Actually, the more it achieves, the more it finds the problems [wd1,4-] Take the women in the better-off coastal cities in the south as an instance.
My women [wd7,-s-] taking the westen [fm1,-] patten [fm1,-] as a model, quit their jobs and reduce to housewives after their husbands have become millionairs [fm1,-] Some even regard it as a fashion to wear [cc3,-2] husband's surname contrasting [vp1,s-] the westen [fm1,-] feminists are struggling for the women's right [vp4,s-] be called by their own names.
What is undeniable, however, is that China is the country that makes the greatest accomplishment in women affairs and the whole world recognizes it with the honor of the 1st World Women's Conference being held in this country in 1995.
(t9-13) 	What should a woman look like?
Hearing this question, most people may come to this [wd3,s-] answer that a woman should be as busy as a bee in the kitchen, sweep the floor while telling the children's story and knit while humming the cradlesong.
But this has been severely criticised by feminists who strongly advocate that women shouldn't be confined to housework and they have the right to work as men do.
These feminists are the champion [np3,4-] for the liberation of women from the yoke of chores.
To some extent, they do help women gain some equality, especially in China where women have been fettered by the feudal tradition of the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues for so many years.
But in my opinion, generally they have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
Although most women are still clinging to traditionally feminine jobs such as nursing, teaching and office work, some pioneers have ventured into new fields which used to be men's patent.
They run business, become astronauts, lawyers and take up politics.
The tide of working women seems to sweep the world.
But just as the common saying goes: "To be a woman is difficult but [wd3,s-] to be an independent woman is more difficult.
" Women's new role in the society has created some striking effects on both the society and the family.
In the first place, since a woman work [vp3,2-] and is able to support herself, she becomes free to choose her marriage.
As a result, today's women tend to marry later.
Their devotion to their career results in the decline of birthrate.
Perhaps this is welcome in some developing countries with overpopulation, but it poses a threat to some western-European countries whose population is too small to coincide with its rapid pace of economic development.
In the second place, women's new role touches their family life.
The most direct victims are their children.
They spend most of their time not with their parents but with baby-sitters and teachers in the kindergartens.
Due to the lack of motherly love, they tend to have an uncommunicative and eccentric disposition.
For the working mothers have to devote themselves to their work, they can spare little time to take care of their children.
Consequently, their children drift apart from them.
Some working mothers make a success in their career, which does give them pride and self-confidence, but also makes them "guilty" towards their children.
Owing to the long-time lack of communication, the children no longer tell their secrets first to their mothers, nor act like a spoiled child in front of their mothers.
All of these deeply hurt the working mothers.
They always try to make some compensation.
Some of them have to take up a double career --- both as a working woman and as a housewife.
Every day, they're kept constantly on the run between their home and office.
Endless social activities and the drudgery of housework almost become the main content of their life.
They are tired of the inflexible life but they have to put up with it because they want to be both a qualified career woman and a qualified mother.
However, they're deficient in energy.
They feel a heavy burden, which makes them at the edge of collapse.
They're exhausted both mentally and physically.
So, working women do have gained self-confidence and independence, but haven't gained real happiness.
Thirdly, women's new role has a bad influence on the relationship between wife and husband.
It must be admitted that more and more husbands are willing to share housework with their wives.
But we must realise the deep- rooted tradition that the housework is mainly under the charge of women.
So, most men only accept the theory of sharing chores with their wives, but they don't put it into practice.
They have got used to being greeted by their wives when they come home and being served the delicious meal when they sit at the table.
When their wives take a career, all have changed.
Unavoidably, they will blame each other for not supporting and understanding the other party [wd3,s-] The worse is the marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her career than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does.
The two points become the main reasons for the increase of divorce rate.
Usually it is the wife who hurts most because women are more fragile in sentiment (we cannot deny women's nature).
The last point I'd like to mention is that feminists' view of women's complete equality to men is unpractical.
The physical differences between women and men determine that women can't be qualified with any career that attracts them.
If a weak woman insists on doing the job of carrying luggage at station just as the man does, it will only ruin her.
It's pointless to compete with men in this aspect.
It's a fact that women often meet great difficulties on their way to the success of their careers which are beyond their traditional ones.
The factor of themselves and the factor of the society have both prevented them from reaching the top.
Nowadays, working women see themselves in a new light.
They've realised their own value.
But for women, taking a career involves sacrifice --- either their family harmony or their physical health.
However, most of the working women are bearing a heavy burden --- the double career (home and office).
Feminists have helped women shake off the traditional yoke of housework, but who will help them to lay down to [wd3,s-] heavy burden of double career [np6,2-] ?
(t9-14) 	Men and women compose a wonderful world and the relationship between them remains changing throughout the history.
In the ancient matriarchal society, women dominated the society.
Then when the society entered into [wd5.-] the patriarchal society, men took a leading role and this continues till now.
Yet ever since 70's, the movement of women liberation has been brought before people, particularly in the Western country [np6,4-] 	Feminists insist that women should be equal to men and women should go out to work in the society instead of staying at home taking care of the kids.
It's a great challenge to the traditional concept and it made women re-consider how to carry out their self-value in the society.
As a result, many women return to the colourful society and become career women.
People view [vp1,-4] on this phenomenon differently.
Some say that it has done more harm than good to the cause of women.
Yet I'm afraid I can't agree with that.
Women should go out to the society as men do.
First, what on earth is the cause of women?
Of course, family is a great cause to women, yet it's far from enough.
Besides taking good care of her husband and kids, a woman should also try her hand in society --- take a job.
Everyone is born equal, so women and men should have the same right, the same freedom to choose one's own cause.
Admittedly, there does exist difference between men and women, yet it doesn't matter.
Since there are divisions of labour, people should cooperate with each other.
As long as people take the job which suits them, it's O.K.
And only when women go out to the society can they have enough chance to realize their value, to exert their ability fully.
Just staying at home looking after the kids, doing the house chores and serving the husband is not all that women can do, their wisdom and ability enable them to do much and more greater [aj3,1-] thing [np6,5-] than these, of course those house work [np3,2-] are great too.
Maybe some people worry that if women take jobs [cc3,1-] , then it will do harm to the family and it may be too much for women to take a job as well as keep the house.
If you come to China and have a look, you will find that this worry is groundless.
Most women in China have a job as her husband does and they also have a happy family, lovely kids.
It's partly due to Chinese women's hardworking [wd2,2-] yet more important is that how people view [vp1,-2] on it.
If all the people are for [pp1,s-] a woman to have her own career and give her chance, such as the government set [vp3,2-] up kindergarten [np6,2-1] where the mother can sent [vp9,1-] their kids to [wd5,s-] and then go to work at ease, and also the husband should have a hand in the house chores, then a woman can own a happy family and her own career at the same time.
To go out to the society is not only good for women themselves, it can strengthen the linking between husband and wife as well.
If a woman just stay [vp3,4-] at home and do [vp3,s-] all the housechores [fm2,-] I'm sure she will get bored of it sooner or later.
Even worse, she will be out of keeping with society because of her lack of contact with it.
She will have no idea of what's going on except the price in the market.
While on the other hand, the husband goes home after a tiring day, and he maybe [fm2,1-2] too tired to talk to his wife too much about the work, to care about the housework and kids, and if he has any trouble in work he won't talk with her complaining wife for she can't understand him at all.
Then gradually, the husband and wife haven't much common language, and the link between them will break.
Yet if both the husband and wife have their career, and do the housework together, they will find it easier to communicate with each other and feel [vp1,-s-] more like that they are in the same boat.
They can share their happiness and sorrowness [fm2,-] both in work and about family together.
In reality, it's also impossible for all the women to stay at home.
Due to the division of labour, men and women should cooperate with each other for both of them have their own speciality [fm1,-] General [wd2,-4] speaking, men are taking a leading role in the world, yet there are some fields that men can't take the place of women.
So what about encouraging the women to go out to the society and make the world more colourful?
(t9-15) 	Feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In my opinion, it goes the other way round.
Since the women liberation, women have raised their social status.
Women have obtained more freedom.
Women are more confident than ever.
In short, feminists speak out for women, hence, women can have as equal chances as men.
In the long history of human society evolution, women have been cosidered [fm1,-] to be inferior to men, except for in [wd5,2-3] the matrilineal commune.
The duty of women was to wait on men, attend to family chores and care for children.
Women had no position of their own whether inside or outside families, while men are [vp6,s-] justified to dominate the whole society.
It is, of course, totally unfair.
Women possess their unique merits.
They are fit for a large number of jobs.
They need not be the accesory [fm1,-] of men.
They certainly can support themselves and even compete with men openly and fairly.
They must break away [wd4,2-3] the traditional norms that women are not match for men.
Feminists stand out and call on their sisters to strive for their own rights.
They stir their sisters' sleeping consciousness in order to help them out of men's domination.
The facts prove that women have contributed a great deal to the whole society since they are equal to men as a member [np3,s-] of the society.
Women are not born to be confined to a family.
They can act not only the part of [wd4,2-1] daughter, wife and mother, but also the part of [wd4,3-1] secretary, teacher, minister, president and so on.
They have the ability to do a good job as long as the whole society will do away with the concept that women are stupider [aj3,-] or weaker than men.
When women walk out of the small limited circle, they will see a very broad world around her [pr3,s-] In this world, they will explore and develop their potential capability.
They infuse the active power into the original men-dominating world and thus promote the development of the society in all aspects.
As women enter the outside world, the competition becomes more and more fierce.
It undermines men's superiority and wons [fm2,-] their respect towards women.
However, women should not be misled in the process of self-support.
There exists sexual discrimination in the division of jobs.
Women are considered to be able to do only a few kind [np3,2-] of traditional jobs.
Most of these jobs are regarded as unimportant by men.
Therefore, that women go out to work does not necessarily mean women have equal opportunities.
Women should have the ability to challenge other jobs, especially [wd4,s-] which are [wd5,s-] used to be men's, such as politician and scientists.
Meanwhile, women should not be blind to see their own limitedness.
They must act in accordance with their existing and potential abilities.
Although women can do more jobs than housework, they are not supposed to do all kinds of jobs.
If women can't walk out their small circle and speak and act for themselves, they are more likely to be a loser [np3,7-] When children grow up, they leave their mother.
Husbands may not value their wives very much and tend to have affairs with other women.
As years go by, women sacrifice their youth and beauty.
They take pride in, if any, only their husbands or children.
However, their husbands or children will do better jobs than they will if they support them.
In such circumstance [np6,2-] women may take scrificication [fm1,-] into account.
All in all, whenever possible, women ought not to hide in the shadows of men.
They have all reasons to struggle against the oppression and discrimination of men.
As long as there are men and women in [wd3,5-2] the earth, they are equal.
Women don't have to submit to men.
Women are free to choose to do what they like or what they are fit for.
As Chinese say, women can hold up half the sky.
(t9-16) 	A well-balanced nature, which used to be an Eden for humanity has no longer existed because humanity has regarded himself as the masters [np3,s-] of nature and has been excessively exploiting and utilizing natural resources without considering the consequnces [fm1,-] that will follow, let alone paying any attention to nature's calling.
In order to develop industries and build housing estate, mankind constantly cuts down trees at will, exploits prairie [np6,1-] and primative [fm1,-] forest without reconstruction [wd2,1-1] them, or even removes a whole hill for some aim.
For the purpose of chasing profits, they hunt and kill immense [cc4,-2] wild animals.
Worsely [fm2,-] people even destroy nature carelessly: deposit litter freely, release the waste even harmful residue and water into the rivers and discharge black poisonous smoke into the air.
Then, what are the consequences after continuous devastating destruction of nature?
Human beings sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.
In some urban cities and developing areas since pollutants discharged surpass the ability of natural purification, these places become unsuitable ones for people to live in.
Noise pollution and atmosphere and water pollution are the major problems.
People also suffer from the acid rain.
Residents in some areas with river passing by will suffer from serious shortage of drink [wd2,1-] water because the river has been aggravatingly pollutted [fm2,-] and covered with floating rubbish.
In the countrysides [np5,-] the placid pastoral life and tranquil environment have been damaged in line with the invasion of modern industries.
The fresh atmosphere has been pollutted [fm2,-] and the clean streams are covered by the waste residue and water.
Bad hygiene [wd2,1-1] conditions are the commonly existing components [wd7,s-] in rural areas.
Manmade intervention also disrupts the ecological balance.
Soil erosion, desertification, salinisation-alkalinisation [fm2,-] and land degradation emerge, which also worsen the disasters like droughts and floods.
Besides, a tendency of increasing temperature and less rainfall stem [vp3,s-] from the destruction of massive grassland and forest, which also cause [vp3,s-] the changable [fm2,-] climate.
In addition, we lost something precious that we can not obtain forever.
It is reported that some materials in the tropical forest, which are the elements of medicine against cancer, Aids or other dangerous diseases disappear because of the deforestation.
It is estimated that in the future our decendents [fm2,-] can only appriciate [fm1,-] regretly [fm2,-] the beautiful rare wildlife like tiger and red-crowned crane in pictures because they are now becoming extinct.
Fortunately, humanity is finally aware of and face the degenerating environment.
People nowadays realize how wrong they have done to nature and begin to take pratical [fm1,-] actions to protect environment.
Various conferences on environmental protection were held.
Laws on pollution control have been established.
Some countries commence to concern about the endangered species and publish laws and regulations to ban illegal wildlife trade and set up natural reserve.
Measures are taken to stop the vicious cycle of exhaustion of rescources [fm1,-] and the deterioration of the environment.
Mankind tries to remodify [fm1,-] and co-ordinate the relationship between humanity and nature by saving natural rescources [fm1,-] controlling birthrate, promoting moderate consumption, implementing overall adjustment and control and restoring the ecology.
A world-wide champaign [fm1,-] of environmental protection popularizes [vp1,s-] and more and more people join the issue.
People contrive and manufacture rescource-saving [fm1,-] products and search for clean energy source.
The concept of envionmental [fm1,-] protection even roots in the young generation.
People consciously control their behaviours that may do harm to nature, lessen [vp1,-3] using plastical [fm2,-] bags or other products that may pollute envionment [fm1,-] 	Meanwhile, people reconstruct environment by afforestation and purifying water rescources [fm1,-] Some places which used to be garbage receptacles now become beautiful scenes.
Some large-scale banks and companies invest numerous [np8,-1] capital to save the pollutted [fm2,-] rivers and scenery spots.
Nuclear-power stations have been built and put into use, replacing the conventional, heavily pollutted [fm2,-] coal-power station.
All these not only protect the enviornment [fm1,-] but also beautify our survival surroundings for a better life.
(t9-17) 	I am not a feminist but I totally approve [vp1,-s-] those actions taken by the feminists to protect women and to seek equal status with men, because in varying degrees, women in the world are in a lower position than men and treated unfairly.
This situation is urgently calling for improvement.
For example, in China, girls are always at a disadvantageous position of enrollement [fm1,-] for primary schools, middle-schools and even universities.
They have to achieve higher marks than boys so as to attract attention.
It's an undeniable fact that women's intelligence is commonly dispised [fm1,-] and ignored.
Imagine what a loss to human being [np6,2-1] if we couldn't have Mrs. Curie's great contibution [fm1,-] Women surely also have ability (if not equally great) to promote human development.
Feminists [np4,s-] fight for women' equal opportunity to gain education is undoubtably [fm2,-] wise and beneficial.
Concerning work, women have made greater efforts to get the jobs.
The girl graduates are always less populor [fm1,-] no matter how hard they have worked through all these years, no matter how [wd3,-2] good marks they have achieved, only because their opponents are boys who were born to have the merit endowed by god [fm3,s-] And women also have to struggle for equal payment for the same amount of work.
The unfair payment surely dampens women's enthusiasm for their professions, on the other hand, it encourages men's arrogance and unconscientiousness.
What on earth [ad1,s-] good does this social unfairness brings to human [np6,s-] ?
The depression of those enterprising women?
The satisfaction of the incapable men?
The whole draging [fm1,-] of human development?
These social phenomenons [fm1,-] often trouble me.
But [wd4,s-] women in some regions have more miserable fate even shock me vehemently.
In Islamic countries, women have to wear veils all the time and wear long rob [fm1,-] letting [wd3,-] no part of body being seen by public [np7,1-] Women have no right to vote, to have their own profession, to take roles in the sports games.
They are considered as personal property of men.
Through efforts, women gained the right to hold the first women sports games in 1993.
But, ridiculously, no men were allowed to watch any match in it, because the women had exposed their bodies.
It seems that in Islamic countries, women's human [wd5,1-1] bodies are regarded as indecency.
While in some regions of [wd3,1-1] Africa, a woman have [vp3,2-] to wear rings around their [pr3,s-] neck from a little girl [wd7,s-] and add [vp3,s-] rings every year so as to make the neck longer and longer.
Only because their long neck is considered to be elegant, women have to torture themselves to please the men.
Women have no identity at all in many places.
They are only accessories of men.
The situation has to be changed.
When human [np6,1-1] is striking through all these centuries for development, this problem became [vp6,s-] more and more outstanding.
Women should stand up to fight for themselves if god doesn't bless them.
Feminists are pioneers in this move.
They have gain [vp9,2-] some rights for women through years
(t9-1) 	I don't think feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In the past, women were universally looked down upon by men.
The man was the master of the house.
He should be respected and listened to by his wife.
Women were considered housewives more than anything else.
They were expected to stay at home, rear children and take care of the house.
With regard to the children, boys were always cherished in a family.
Girls could not do the same thing as boys did.
They had no right to go to school, to go out and play with other boys and to do what they wanted.
All they were permitted to do was to sit at home and to do some sewing.
What a pitiful life they lived!
Thanks to the feminists who have taken the lead to break through the outmoded convention, the position of women nowadsys [fm1,-] has ranked almost paralell [fm1,-] to that of men.
The majority of women receive good education.
They are doing what they like: taking up advertising, furnishing or interior decoration, studying science, medicine or law, etc.
All these prove that women are obviously not inferior to men in their working ability.
Nowadays, women live much happier lives than those of [wd5,-] long ago.
They make friends with both sexes without feeling uneasy or embarrassed.
They are respected and served by men in conventional circles where they enjoy [vp1,-3] together at conversation, games and amusements.
They are no longer left at home by their husbands to look after their children and their in-laws [wd4,s-] to manage the house chore.
On the whole, they have more freedom to choose what they like to do.
To draw the conclusion, I think that both sexes should regard each other as equals.
In fact, women have a lot of potentials.
If given more opportunities, they can do more contribution [cc3,2-] to the society.
In this aspect, feminists have played an important role.
(t9-2) 	I don't think this opinion is right.
In countries like China and Japan, the males were much respected by the females.
Although nowadays that old custom has been changed [wd4,s-] lot, to some extent, it still has some negative effect.
At the present time, many women have become professionalists [fm2,-] A women [np3,1-] with high standard of education occupies herself with a profession, however, most of the time she would work on an employment with a salary which does not match up to her knowledge and qualification.
Many people also have the old-fashioned idea that a married woman should stay at home to look after the house and that her education and knowledge should be a heritage for her children in later years.
And her children need her discipline and guidance to form good, healthy charater [fm1,-] But what about the woman herself, if a woman with qualification and efficioncy [fm1,-] wouldn't be engaged in a profession, her knowledge acquired through several years of hard study would be wasted, I think it is unfair.
Most women nowadays are able to be independent of a living.
We can find women working with men in some fields of occupation, distinguish themselves by their ability, efficiency and cautiousness.
Under such circumstance, feminists declaim [vp1,-s-] that women should be respected and be treated equally in every area.
They fight [wd4,-] equivalent rights [cc3,1-] for women.
In fact, they do good to women.
Through their persistent struggle, women though not exactly above men in everything, are almost parallel to men in their social life as well as in their profession.
Women work side by side with men and some of them even hold higher position than men do.
I believe that in future women can aquire [fm1,-] rights that men have.
(t9-3) 	We are told according to the history book that long time ago there used to be a society in which men and women were cooperative and both sexes were living in peace.
As time passed bit by bit, men came into power in a society little by little, and now in such an industrial society, it seems men are dominator [np3,2-1] in any fields [np6,1-] Thus feminism came into being in order to obtain equal rights with men.
Unfortunately, feminists have been mistaking "equal rights" for "equal power", consequently they have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
Let's look at the following facts that will confirm my opinion that women, with the help of "feminists", are living in even poor [aj3,2-1] situation.
One fact is that the word "superpower woman" ("nu qiang ren") has come into being.
What is a "superpower woman"?
Well, such a woman should be both a capable housewife and an energy [wd2,1-1] boss.
In a man-dominating feminism [wd2,s-] (I mean the idea or thought of that is controled [fm2,-] by men) movement, the situation can be easily interpreted as "she has traditional female virtue as well as modern ideas to be equal with men".
But in my opinion that cannot be called "equal" and is overbear [vp9,1-2] for women.
Another fact is that feminism have [vp3,s-] doubled the market of cigarette.
I don't think it is a good habit to smoke heavily, as we all know that smoking do [vp3,s-] a great harm [np5,2-] to our health.
Only men [wd3,s-] smoking is "bad" enough; women, demanding the same as men and joining such [wd4,1-2] smoking trend, is worse [wd7,s-] .
Maybe this example is not quite proper.
I cite it only to prove that it [wd4,s-] unnecessary to equalize everything.
An ideal society is one in which both sexes cooperate, help each other and live in harmony.
To strive for such a society.
we should not go beyond the proper limits in correcting an error.
Now the error is that men is [vp3,1-] dominating the society.
What we should do is to establish a new world in which women cooperate with men but not dominate men or do everything bad that men do.
(t9-4) 	In 1880, seeing her husband come into her bedroom, the honored empress had to kneel down before the emperor, calling herself *"his slave.
**" In 1980, women walked with their husbands hand in hand, happiness shown on their faces.
This great change would not have taken place without the persistent efforts of feminists.
It was feminists who realized that the inequality between the two sexes were unjust and made other women conscious of their situation.
Through lectures, advertisements and brochures, they call on women to struggle for their rights they deserve.
It has been very hard because most men, accustomed to their predominance in the society, are strongly against the feminists.
Even some women regarded [vp6,d] themselves inferior to men and can't understand why feminists want to be equal with superior men.
The tradition has existed for a long time and is very forceful, But feminists' persistence has set a good example to women and encourges [fm1,-] them to be courageous and persistent.
Besides educating women, feminists have been leading them to show women's anger towards the unequality [fm2,-] in terms of strikes and demonstration, which have been very forceful and effective.
Their efforts have brought positive results.
Lots of women have come out of their kitchens and have jobs in many fields such as politics, financial [wd2,3-3] sports and even astronomy which were dominated by men before.
By doing so women are more independent than their ancestors and therefore more confident and happier than before.
We should not forget that feminists have brought benifit [fm1,-] to not only the cause of women, but also the cause of men.
By having jobs, women share men's great burden.
Women are more equal [aj3,1-] with [wd3,4-1] men, which results in better communication.
All this could not have been achieved without feminists.
Feminists are continuing their efforts, trying to change some tokenism to real equality.
I hope they will get more support from the society.
(t9-1) 	According to the dictionary feminism is the belief that woman should have the same rights, power, and opportunities as men.
Feminists are those who believe in and support feminism.
In my opinion feminists have done much good to the cause of women.
Feminism helps to promote women's position both in society and family.
As far as women's social status is concerned, nowadays there are quite a large number of female politicians, scientists, professors, doctors, etc.
Women have almost entered every field of work.
Politically speaking women have the same right to vote and be elected as men.
Now female political leaders are not a rare thing as we see that [wd4,3-3] former British prime minister Tharcher [fm1,-] is a well-known woman politician.
Some people' [np4,1-1] belief that politics belongs to men is no longer accepted by both men and women since many facts have proved this belief wrong.
Thatcher is a good example.
Economically speaking women are able to earn as much money as men.
In the current of reforming women take up doing business as well as men and some get quite rich.
It is no longer true that making money is men's task.
Women can do the same.
In addition girls can do as well as boys in school.
Many teachers have noticed the phenomenon that in the early years of education girls averagely tend to receive higher marks than boys.
This provides strong evidence for the idea that women and men are mentally equal though they cannot be physically equal.
We have to admit that men are stronger than women with regard to physical strength.
But this difference does not exist in the aspect of mental ability.
Many girls get their MA or doctor's degree as well.
Since in so many aspects women's ability is the same as men's, why should not women get the same rights and opportunities as men?
Before women were liberated from the traditional view that women are born family caretakers, they were bound to their children, husbands, and families.
They did housework all day long.
No opportunity was provided for them to participate in social activities.
Under such conditions how can women show their talent?
We can be sure to say that many talented women lost the opportunity to become somebody.
In this sense feminists have done much good to the cause of women because their belief contributes to the establishment of women's self-confidence and self-respect.
Because of feminism women can have their own cause for which they exert themselves.
Once offered the same opportunities as men, women are able to compete with men and even surpass them in some aspects.
For example, teacher [wd3,-s-] seems to be one of the favourite professions for women.
One reason may be that women are apt to love students due to their experience of looking after their own children.
They may like to be with children to help them grow healthily, and to impart knowledge.
Being a woman she possesses particular qualities that can never be found in a man.
So it is unfair to say that women are inferior to men.
Since all men are created equal, women should have the same rights, power, and opportunities as men.
What feminists have done is greatly helpful to the cause of women.
No one can disregard the achievement of feminism in discovering women's ingenuity for the society's use.
(t9-2) 	As the social [wd2,2-1] develops Feminism becomes one of the social phenomena.
What the feminists advocate is to improve the women's social status, make the women release [vp4,3-4] from the heavy housework and make the women have an equal opportunity to go to social [wd2,2-2] with man, and so on.
In a word, feminists think the men and the women is [vp3,2-] equal.
On the one hand, the phenomena reflect [vp1,-s-] that thoughs [fm1,-] of the women has been liberate [vp9,2-] [vp1,2-2] [cc5,-2] more furtherly [ad3,1-] [fm2,-] than before.
On the other hand, the thoughs [fm1,-] has done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In anciet [fm1,-] the [np7,2-3] women were consider [vp9,1-] as the humble classes [np6,s-] and machine of giving birth to children, the [np7,s-] women are [vp6,s-] inferior to men.
For example the women were prevented from taking part in the anciet [fm1,-] Olympic Sports.
Now the [np7,s-s-] women become an essential part of social [wd2,1-] The [np7,s-1] women not only can take [vp2,-2] part of the social action concerning political, economic, [wd4,-3] culture's [wd2,-2] field [np6,1-] the women [wd5,s-] but also can became [vp9,1-] managers, drivers, teachers, and so on.
At present, social [wd2,-1] can't provide equal opportunity of employ [wd2,1-] with [vp2,5-5] the [np7,-] men to the [np7,-] women in a certain captimism's [fm1,-] [wd2,-1] country.
Nevthless [fm1,-] the phenomena are less.
While the completely equal [wd2,2-1] between the men and the women is out of the question First, the physical differnce [fm1,-] is existence [cc3,1-] On a [wd3,1-1] whole the [wd5,-1] men are strong, the [wd5,-1] women are weak, which lead the men to become the embodiment of strenghth [fm1,-] and make the men be equal to the heavy physical work [cc1,8-] nevthless [fm1,-] the [wd5,-1] women can't do it.
Secondly the [wd5,-1] wen [fm1,-] usually are bravery [wd2,1-] and confidence [wd2n3-] the [wd5,-1] women are tender and cautions [wd2,4-] The characterises [wd2,1-1] of the wen [fm1,-] make the men be prone to work in the social [wd2,1-1] and the women stay at home to look after the children.
If the men tend for [wd3,1-4] the child other than the women.
Which neither [wd1,s-] embodies the advantage of the men nor embodies the advantage of the women.
 [wd7,s-] In a word, the distinguish [wd2,1-1] between the men and the women in social act [np6,2-l] is only social's [wd2,-1] difference [wd2,-1] distribution rather than discriminate [wd2,s-] the women.
We must accept the difference between the men and the women.
To some extent, the opinion which feminists emphasis [wd2,1-1] on is at the cost of the women's health.
Beause [fm1,-] the women's power is limit [wd2,1-] in contrast with the men's power For example, the women [np4,1-2] world's [np4,2-1] champion of runing [fm2,-] 100m must [vp9,-] ran more slowly [ad3,-] than the men's world champion.
If people consider the [wd5,-1] wen [fm1,-] and the [wd5,-1] women as the same as feminists describe, the [wd5,-1] women will undertake the [wd5,-3] [cc3,1-2] more impression from the social [wd2,2-1] and theirself [fm2,-] It will enfluence [fm1,-] the women's health in a long term, [wd4,s-] what is more, minize [fm1,-] the men's effect on the faimly [fm1,-] and the social [wd2,1-] It is against what the feminists wish.
Therefore, the view of feminists isn't [vp9,4-1] deserve standing absolutely.
We must deal with the view of feminists correctly.
(t9-3) 	Feminists could have appeared with the development of the society.
About [ad1,s-] in the 1970's, feminists turn up [vp6,s-] in the advanced western countries.
They stuck firmly to the feminism, the principle that women should have the same rights and chances as men.
But contrary to our common sense, feminists were usually male other [wd3,4-2] than female.
Feminists initiated the women movement to fight up [wd5,1-1] against those old-fashioned traditional concepts, and appealed to the society for men and women's equality.
We could say its original meanings and aims were good.
But actually, feminists have gone to extremes to exaggerate the women's status nowadays, so it's not surprising that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
Why should we think so?
In the first [wd4,3-] social division of labour is different, and men and women have different ability.
Many kinds of jobs, especialy [fm1,-] those jobs which need strength, don't suit to [vp2,1-] women.
Although the society is advancing rapidly, many jobs tend to need wisdom other than strength, we still think so, for men and women have distinguishing [wd3,-] physiological characteristics.
Women are superior at imagination, language, memory and feelings, but men are good at mathatics [fm1,-] physics, operation, and so on.
If we could let men and women engage in [vp1,1-6] what jobs most suit to each other, this kind of rational division of labour would do good to the social advancement.
In the second [wd4,3-] the name of women is titled [fm2,1-] by [wd5,6-2] 'the weak'.
Women are like bird [np6,3-] but men are like tree [np6,3-] Bird [np6,-2] should hide under [wd3,-4] the shade of tree [np6,1-2] to avoide [fm1,-] the strong sunlight.
It's the same situation to the human being.
Feminists' opinions encourage women to compare with men [vp1,2-5] in all sorts of ways.
We often run across such situation [np6,1-] : a woman possesses money and success of enterprise [cc1,2-] but in [wd3,-2] the same time loses her feminine qualities and doesn't look lovely as before.
She gets married late, and [wd3,s-] even becomes a spinster.
In essence, feminism is the mainly [wd2,-1] reason for such tragedy.
At last, what's the true meaning of the cause of women' after all?
Feminists usually limit its meaning to the liberation of women.
In their opinions, women don't need to rely on men, women can earn enough money to support themself [fm2,-] women should work hard at their work, women can become manager [np6,3-] scientist [np6,s-] and even president [np6,s-] We couldn't say the view is wrong, but women's cause also include [vp3,3-] helping men with their enterprises, bringing up children.
Men couldn't be pregnant.
It is women's responsibity [fm1,-] to bring birth a new life [cc3,4-] to the world.
If all the women gave up houswork [fm1,-] to climb along the career ladder, what would happen to the world?
The family would break up frequently, divorce should happen, and the society would be unstable, then women couldn't get truly liberated When God makes man and woman, he expects them to help each other rather than fight up [wd5,1-3] against each other.
This is only my personal opinion, do you agree with me?
(t9-4) 	In most countries, feminist [np6,-2] have strugled [fm1,-] for the right for many years.
So in most countries the role of women is changing.
Today, many women are going into professions, such as medicine, low [fm1,-] engineering [wd4,s-] even police [cc1,4-] They comprise a large part of the workers in business and factories, and, in addition, they are working up to important jobs which used to be held predominantly by men.
There are [vp3,-3] even some business which are [vp3,2-] run completely by women in some countries.
However, they still run up against some roadblocks since many government jobs are closed to them, and certain jobs are not considered honorable for women.
In general, they feel they are more liberated now and have an alternative to their old way of life.
But these have rised [fm2,-] [wd3,s-] the satues [fm1,-] of women indeed?
In some countries, such as Russia, over half the doctors are women, over 30 percent of the engineers are women, practically all the teachers are women, and women comprise over half the university students.
But, the majority of manual laborers in Russia are women.
In fact four-fifths of Russia's working women are engaged in physical labor.
As in most countries, women predominate in the lowest paying professions.
In plain terms, women such as china [fm3,3-] [cc1,3-] work hard.
In some ways, Chinese women are rewarded for their hard work.
They can rise to positions of prestige more easily than elsewhere.
and [fm3,-s-] for the most part, they are [wd5,1-3] get equal pay for equal work.
But the thing is not so good.
Because women [wd4,1-2] prodominant [fm1,-] in the low-paying fields, they receive, actually, less money than man [np6,6-] In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to positions of leadership even in professions they dominant [wd2,1-3] in some countries, such as Russia.
Although men comprise only 15 percent of all [wd4,1-1] people involved in helth [fm1,-] care, they [wd3,-s] are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervisors, and administrators.
Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm management [wd3,s-] 	in [fm3,-s-] the [wd5,1-1] addition, feminist [np6,-1] is not to relieve the burden of women, on the countrary [fm1,-] inurese [fm1,-] it.
Although women enter professions, they should do nearly all the housework in plain minds [wd7,2-] They are not only earning the money, but also watching the children washing.
Every day, after their working, women can't have a rest like men.
They have to prepare dinner, have to wash the plates and so [wd4,-] .
In fact, women do the double of work.
So we can say "faminist [fm1,-] [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of women than good".
(t9-5) 	On account of history, some western countries such as America, England, and Iceland, have always an advanced culture in physically [wd2,1-] [wd7,s-] It makes a good chance for women in these countries to have a good education.
The women in these countries always lead a life comfortable [wd1,2-] and wealth [wd2,5-] In physically [wd2,1-] they have almost melt [vp9,1-] Good education makes them have an intensive self-sense [wd7,2-] In some respects, they appeal for personality libration [fm1,-] strongly.
But whatever [wd3,s-] the woman [np3,s-1] work hard [wd1,s-] at their cause, they always have run [vp6,s-] up against a few serious roadblocks in their successful road [cc1,1-] In practice, women often find it difficult to rise to [wd4,1-2] position of leadership in professions they dominate.
At last, in order to obtain their rights, they alway [fm1,-] have a feminist.
Although they have many reason [np3,1-] to do this, in general, in my view, feminist [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.
Though this is the world that man is advantagous [fm1,-] over women, in general, the society still advocate [vp3,4-] equality between man and woman.
The socity [fm1,-] have [vp3,2-] given several "the lady first" conditions for women because of [wd4,2-2] differences both man and woman.
But [wd4,1-2] feminist emplisises [fm1,-] woman's right too much.
I think it is extreme [wd4,-] Let's suppose, once the feminist would success [wd2,1-] The woman [np3,s-1] have full rights to let man [np3,s-] serve [vp2,2-2] for them.
It is not real equality.
The men hate woman [np3,3-] and don't help them.
It will [wd4,1-2] more harm to the cause of woman [np3,s-] than good.
This is one hand [wd7,3-] 	On the other hand There are great differences in physiology between man and woman.
For the woman, they are more fit [aj3,1-] for [wd4,1-2] family than woman [wd3,s-] [wd4,-2] Feminist over-emphsises [fm1,-] woman's political rights, and ignores act's [np4,1-1] in their family.
This result will cause the disintegration of the family unit.
The sociaty [fm1,-] would be out of order.
The woman couldn't go in for their cause with soul and heart [wd1,3-] This would be great harm to women's cause.
In conclusion, feminist [np6,-1] have done more harm to the cause of woman than good.
(t9-6) 	Some people mind [wd3,s-] that the women's movement has brought about [vp1,s-] the [wd5,s-] women more harmness [fm2,-] than goodness [wd3,s-] but I think, the women's movement do [vp3,3-] to the women more good than harm.
Before the women's movement women were considered following cultural tradition to be the best or most "natural" parents and were given [vp7,s-] custody of the children.
In 1970s came finally the women's movement.
The aim of the women's movement is to overcome the legal, economic, and other inequalities that have been termed institutionalized sexism.
The leaders of [wd4,2-1] movement are mainly college-educated women.
It's not surprising that these women are highly sensitive to attitudes and practices which try to limit women's work roles.
In few short [cc4,1-1] years, they caused American society to start reexamining itself, influenced the government to pass antidiscrimination lows [fm1,-] in hiring and increased their following [wd7,2-] 	Women's liberation is surely to take place.
As societies become more technologically advanced, sex roles change gradually, despite institutionalized sexism.
Even in some traditionally male-dominated societies, women are moving toward equality.
The most practical goals of the movement were [vp6,s-s-] to gain job equalities in pay and promotions, because people seem to feel that women's work is inherently unequal to men's.
For women can being [vp9,1-] free [vp9,s-] for [vp1,s-1] work outside the home, the women's movement has called for more child-care centres.
These aims also require changes in the traditional family structure.
Feminists believe that man should play a large role in housework and child care.
These changes in the family life-styles would more equally [ad3,1-] socialize boys and girls and would decrease sex-role difference.
Feminists are trying to change certain cultural myths as well.
Two of these concern working women.
The first is that working women are not as happy as housewives.
But the fact is, more and more women worked [vp6,s-] and the working wives are much more optimistic about job roles.
The second is that women working outside the home are less likely to have happy, stable marriages than housewives, this means that her [pr3,s-] job has a bad effect on her [pr3,s-] marriage.
However, the young working women have slightly greater marital stability than those without jobs.
On the other hand, because the leaders of the movement don't know well the condition of low-educated [cc4,1-1] women, their actions sometimes are not practically [wd2,2-2] and unreasonable, sometimes they go too far away [wd4,2-3] the practical life, those [wd7,s-] bring the women harmness [fm2,-] But those [wd7,d] are not mainly [wd2,2-] 	On the whole, the women's movement bring [vp3,2-] the equality to the women.
Now women are not only housewives, they can also work as men, they have their own independent lives.
So I mind [wd3,s-] the Feminists have done more good to the women than harm.
(t9-7) 	With the progress of society, women have taken an important role in many areas.
Although wearing tradition clothing and staying at home used to be the rule, today many women are going into professions, such as medicine, law and engineering.
Feminists has [vp3,1-] grown rapid [wd2,s-] these years.
In fact, I think the men and women should be equal in position of society, in human rights and personality, also in equal [wd5,s-] paying for equal job.
But the leaders of feminists emphasis [wd2,s-] these too much.
They think women should rise to positions of leadership in every areas [np6,1-] even in some what [pr5,s-] they couldn't do well.
As a [wd5,1-1] women, they have their own characters different from men They do things carefully, they are warm-hearted, but they have limited physical and mental vitality.
Some works [np5,s-] are fit for them to do and others not.
They have their own home, they have to do housework and take care of children, this is a heavy burden.
They couldn't have much time and energy to do heavy work, nomatter [fm2,1-] [wd4,2-4] in physical or in mental vitality.
You can find those women insisting on feminists [wd3,s-] always end the day mentally and physically exhausted.
I think our educated gentlemen could treat women equally in today's life.
The government should offer some work which is easier for them to do.
The women will have much time enjoying their happy life.
Being an ordinary person [np3,s-] they could also do things which they care for in their spare time.
In fact, feminists have done more harm to the women, whether in their work or in their daily-life.
(t9-8) 	Feminists have strugled [fm1,-] for women's right in the [wd5,1-2] most countries for many years, and it has brought some right which only men can [vp6,-2] have before, for example, the women in the [wd5,1-2] many countries can do the same job as men, go to school and enter politics.
Do these make [vp1,-6] the situation of women to rise [cc3,5-] indeed?
As we know, women hadn't been allowed [vp6,s-] to work for few [wd5,s-] thousands of years, such as china [fm3,s-] in which the fedlism [fm1,-] has more than 2000 years of history, the concept [np6,s-] which Kongzi and Mengzi established have posses [wd3,s-] the main situation in many people's brain [cc1,4-] In that [pr3,-1] days, me [pr4,s-] [pr1,s-s-] held the seat of power [cc1,2-] Women was [vp3,1-] thought [vp1,s-] that they could only stay at home and do housework,they must be ruled by men.
It would be normal of [wd3,s-] a man hitted [fm2,-] a women [np3,1-] but conversely, if a man was striked [fm2,-] by a women [np3,1-] that women [np3,1-] would be denounced, even punished.
So women hadn't right in any way.
Although it is known by every people [cc4,1-] that the [wd5,1-4] man [np3,-2] and women is [vp3,5-] equal, furtherly [fm2,-] ensured by law but [wd5,s-] the traditional concept is very difficult to be changed competely [fm1,-] and rapidly.
Some women in the professions consider working an honor and a privilege, but they don't abtain [fm1,-] the same right as men, although they can enter proffessions [fm1,-] such as medicine, architecture, and teacher they couldn't rise to [wd4,2-4] position of prestige more easily.
In practice, it is very difficult, even in proffessions [fm1,-] they dominate.
In the soviet [fm3,2-1] Union, although men comprise only 15 percent of all people involved in health care, they [wd3,s-] are 50 percent of the medical directors, supervistors [fm1,-] and ministrators [fm1,-] Although women comprise 55 percent of all collective farm workers, they are only 33 percent of farm magagement [wd7,s-] And, although most factory worker [np3,2-l] are women, the foreman would likely be a man.
In the [pp2,1-1] addition, Femisnits [fm1,-] is [vp3,1-] not to relieve the burden of women, but to increase it.
for the women entering [vp4,s-s-] proffessions [fm1,-] they not only watches [vp3,3-] the children, but also do cooking, washing.
they [fm3,s-] are often involved in many trifles of their family.
After the working is over, men may go home and have a rest, but they [pr1,s-] can't.
they [fm3,s-] have to prepare dinner for her [pr3,s-] familsies' [fm1,-] and they must get to [vp2,1-] earlier than their husband for breakfast.
So the women now do double of the work.
According to these, the situation of the women hasn't risen [cc1,6-] indeed, and we expect that condition of the women's could be improved in the future.
(t9-9) 	Firstly, I have to say that I can not agree with the given title.
I believe feminists must have already done something beneficial to the cause of women.
If not, why will the fourth world women's conference be held next year?
We can find support from the 38th meeting held from March 7th to 18th by the United Nations' women's status committee.
The preparatory meeting discussed the draft of 'the programme of action', and the detailed rules of procedure.
The programme of action involves items concerning women's vital interests such as: sharing rights at different levels, participating equally in making political and economic decisions, enjoying equal pay for equal work to [wd3,s-] male workers, women's education and health care, elimination of violence towards women.
etc [wd5,s-] 	The representatives pointed out that the World Women's Conference should be coordinated with the World Conference of Human Rights and the World Population and Development meeting which are to be held within two years.
Deputy secretary-general of UN Desay said, the development level of a society can be measured by its women's position.
Women's problems can be taken seriously enough and particularly undertaken [cc2,s-] only when they are brought into other important international conferences.
Many deputies emphasized the importance for women to participate in various fields' decision: women must become fully equal citizens, taking [wd4,1-3] active part in lives of all walk [wd1,4-] and take responsibility for their society's and the world's future.
It must be changed that men dominate organs of power and wield the power procedure.
Yet in many countries now, the number of women leaders in governments, big enterprises and parliaments is reducing.
Even in the United Nations, the percentage of women at policy making positions is only 13%, far less than 25%, the target percentage to be reached by 1995.
Deputies from developing countries universally placed emphasis on [wd4,1-3] urgency of solving these problems: women's poverty, education and health care, especially for peasant women, old women, disabled women and women migrants and refugees.
They pointed out that elimination of poverty is the question which claims precedence over all others.
And women should be taught to read, and enjoy health care, including birth control.
The problem of elimination of violence exists in developed countries as well.
While women refugees suffering from chaos by wars are more likely to fall [vp1,-1] victim.
If a peaceful environment without violence can not be ensured for women, all the efforts promoting equality and development will turn out to be futile.
Since the whole world become [vp3,3-] more and more serious on the issue of women's position.
how can someone say feminists bring more harm to women than good?
(t9-10) 	In the Bible, it is stated that everybody is equal before the God, no matter how poor or rich he/she is, no matter how strong or week he/she is.
Accordingly, "All men are equal" as it is said by George Orwell, thereby, everybody in the world has the right to live, to be educated and to defend himself/herself, and disabled persons are treated equally as normal people, they can live and enjoy themselves as anyone else.
Therefore, all the newly-born babies seem to be equal to each other, but their futures are heavily influenced by their individual family background, social background and one's personal efferts [fm1,-] that is the reason why some of them are more likely to have opptunities [fm1,-] than others, and they are easy to reach their goals.
With or without great personal efferts [fm1,-] which is the implication of George Orwell's statement --- "Some are more equal than others.
" 	When a baby first comes to this world, he/she knows nothing about our world, but something destine [wd2,1-1] will happen to him/her so that he cannot avoid them even though he/she wants to change them.
For example, [wd4,-2] complexion is a character of a nation, people with different complexions should be equal as they are all live creatures created by the [wd5,1-1] God, but things are not always as what we had [vp6,s-] imagined.
In a multi-nationality country, minorities are always looked down upon, and fewer chances of employment, as well as poorer education are supplied to those minorities.
In the United States, the laws have admitted the equality between peoples of different colors.
there [fm3,s-] is still a long distance between the real society and the ideal model of the laws.
In the world, many people in Africa are going hungry, sometimes even suffering from starvation, but some people in other continents are enjoying themselves without taking money into consideration.
Even in the same country, people with the same complexion also differ a lot in acquiring opptunities [fm1,-] and carrying out their rights.
On the other hand, family background plays an important role in one's realization of ego [cc1,2-] For example, every university graduate should be equal, then equal opptunities [fm1,-] can be awarded to them to get a commonly desired job, but in fact, those who have better family background are more likely to get the job no matter whether they are more capable or not than others, which is one of the phenomena metioned by George Orwell --- Some are more equal than others.
But the most important factor in one's life is one's personal striving and struggling, which makes him/her "more equal" [aj3,1-] than others no matter what social and family background he/she has.
Obviously, the process of reaching the destination requires more efferts [fm1,-] and endurance, maybe, those who have no family background will fail several times more than those who have in the whole process [wd7,-] they should endure the failures and never be disappointed to realize their egoes [fm2,-] [cc3,2-] With those great efferts [fm1,-] their futures are promising.
Once they succeed, they will be given more opptunities [fm1,-] as we always give more to those who have much and take away from those who have little [wd7,s-] thus their prevails [vp4,s-] over others will remain and affect [vp1,-2] a lot for a long time.
Then, they are "more equal" [aj3,1-] than others.
So, everyone should struggle from [wd3,s-] him/herself, especially for [wd5,s-] those without good family background.
Only with striving and great efferts [fm1,-] can we make ourselves "more" equal to others.
(b2w-t9-1) I am not in favor of this idea totally.
I think feminists have done good to women themselves and [wd4,s-] society, to some extend [pp2,2-] to family and children.
As we all know, women's position was very low in the past.
They were inferior to men.
They were men's accessorise [fm1,-] First they must abide by their fathers; then be faithful to their husbands.
After husbands died, they must depend on their male children.
So women's fate was tightly connected with men's fate.
Especially in feudal China, women smiled with mouthes [fm2,-] closed; they never dare to go out of their houses alone.
Or they would be considered dissipated.
There were so many codes of ethics that women should follow that women's potentiality couldn't be brought into full play.
God creates women and men to develop society together.
Without women's efforts, productive forces couldn't be promoted very quickly.
So slave and feudal societies were backward and poor, while capital [wd2,-3] and social [wd3,-1] societies developed very quickly.
To some extend [pp2,2-] it's due to women's emacipation [fm1,-] Some jobs do need to be done by women.
Women are more intuitive than men.
In addition, once women go outside to work, they are economically independent, which makes them break away from men's control.
They are never men's accessories again.
Feminists help women to gain more and more rights.
In China they can go to college; they have the vote right; they are entitled to be paid equally for equal work.
That was unthinkable in the old China.
Now when you enjoy Olympic Games, do you know that women were forbidden to participate in it in the beginning?
Fact [np6,s-] proves that women not only [wd1,s-] can do it, but also can do it well.
Especially [ad2,s-] Chinese female athletes win more honor for their motherland.
Someone may say, "If parents all go to work, no one will take care of children.
" Yes, perhaps parents can't spend more time caring about children.
But mothers don't reduce their love to children.
And children also need paternal love.
Why can't fathers and mothers take care of Children [fm3,s-] together?
Meanwhile double income will make family [np6,2-3] live a rich, happy and comfortable life.
Isn't it a good thing?
Anything, only if it fits the development of history, can survive in society.
I think women's emacipation [fm1,-] is unavoidable.
(b2w-t9-2) Since the 1960s, feminism has improved women's life in many respects.
It has been encouraging them to work more diligently, to tap their potential, to make them become more aware of their own existence.
Feminism has also affected men's life in many respects.
It shakes the absolutely dominant position of men.
Their wives who used to be docile are no longer obedient.
Men find their power weakening.
Of course they feel a sense of crisis.
Someone says: "Feminism do [vp3,1-1] more harm to the society than good", which I don't fully agree to.
Some women are totally independent.
They think they can manage their life without men's help.
Only themselves [pr4,s-] are important.
Husbands, children are not their business.
They live by themselves and they like this way of life.
Some other women feel like [pp1,1-5] that their life is complete only when they are at men's side.
They lose themselves in the light of men.
Their roles in the society are only husbands' wives and sons' mothers.
They live on their husbands just like vines crawling on the trees.
I think this is their own choice which other people shouldn't put their fingers in, though I personally don't like the two kinds of life.
They are too radical.
In my opinion, the true meaning of feminism is: It is really very important for a woman to keep a kind of intimate, friendly and deep relationship with a man, but such relationship shouldn't be all she wants.
There are many other important things to do.
Feminism is aimed to help women develop themselves, help them become confident of themselves as independent human beings, to help them get the most benefit from their career, from social and individual life.
I don't understand why some people say that feminism do [vp3,2-3] more harm to the society than good.
Are they afraid of it?
Actually feminism liberates both men and women.
When a woman can take care of herself, she has lessened the man's heavy burden.
If they both work hard, both support the family, both look after the children, the burden will be halved.
If they share the joy, the joy will be doubled; if they share the sorrow, the sorrow will be halved.
Feminism is misunderstood and misinterpreted by some people.
This is the reason that [pr51-] some people say that feminism do [vp3,2-3] more harm to the society than good.
(b2w-t9-3) What is woman?
This is a question even more puzzling than Sphinx's riddle.
In history, or rather his story, man tyies [fm1,-] to put forward a satisfactory answer One incarnation of woman, in man's eyes, may be Pandora, who was a union of beauty and evil, stupidity and temptation.
She opened the forbidden box and brought plaques [wd3,s-] and unhapiness [fm1,-] to mankind.
In order to control the dangerous opposite sex, man [np6,s-] either grabs a whip as what Nicher said, or convinces woman [np6,s-] that as a rib of the Adams, she is intellectually inferior and physically weaker.
Nevertheless, some men and many women who may be called feminists, stick to their own philosophies.
They believe that women are individuals as men, they should have roles separet [fm1,-] from those of wife and mother as men do.
One of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, even boldly attacked what she called the male bias [np2,-1] of [wd3,3-1] Bible, and published her " Women's Bible".
Surely such radical ideas as well as the extrem [fm1,-] language would be hotly debated.
That is why some people stronly [fm1,-] critisized [fm1,-] [vp1,-s-] [vp6,s-s-] that feminism has done great [aj3,2-2] harm than good to the cause of women.
Believe it or not, it is a fact that girls this day are much more happier and freer than their mother or grandmother, although they still confront some problems such as less oppertunities [fm1,-] of employement [fm1,-] than boys, smaller pay and limited scale of career, and abortion etc.
More credit should be given to the feminists.
When women realized maternity, the biological role of them has troditionally [fm1,-] been regarded as their major social role, and the law written by men who were stongly [fm1,-] influenced by that stereotype turned out unfaveralb [fm1,-] and unequal to them, they began to fight for vote and for the chances to be legislators.
After a long period of struggle, in June 1919, U.S. Congress finally passed the women's suffage [fm1,-] bill and the 19th Amendment to the constitution became law on Aug.26 1920.
Some 25 million women in U.S. had [vp6,s-] won the right to vote.
 [wd4,-3] Same victory had [vp6,s-] been gained in Great Britain and other parts of the [wd5,2-1] Europe later.
In China, the New Cultural movement [fm3,s-] also brought a sort of emacipation [fm1,-] to women.
"New woman " came to be used in the popular press and widely spread.
As time goes by, feminists never stop their pursuit of full equality for women.
In 1966, Betty Eridan, the auther [fm2,-] of the famous "Feminine Mystique" organized the National Organization for Women ( NOW )in U.S., it agitated for such improvements as child-care for professional women who wanted to work.
They also lectuered [fm1,-] lobbied in congress, and filed legal suits against sex discrimination.
Socialists are usually feminists or the supporters of the feminism, because they believe a cooperative society would show respect to the right of women, so in China, women are supposed to hold up the half of the sky.
Since nothing is perfect, feminism itself certainly has some troubles to deal with.
For example, does the equality means the end of the the [wd6,1-] family and home?
Was it expressed in the way that all the difference between man and woman has to be abolished?
Is it possible for women and men [vp4,s-] live in peace?
To sum up all of these, women like men have to think of one question first that is, "What is woman?
" There is a [np7,-1] old chinese [fm3,2-1] saying, which goes like "more and less are equally bad", it is quite important for feminists [vp4,s-] pay much attention to the limit of their efforts.
Anyway, we are the world, we can do without the opposite sex, neither man nor woman.
(b2w-t9-4) In recent years, feminism has achieved many of its goals.
Women began to be treated in a really equal way.
Still, there are many negative opinions, one of which is that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
In my opinion, it is insensible to hold such an attitude, as we can conclude from the analysis of the present conditions of the feminism [wd2,1-1] movement.
As we all know, through the persistant [fm1,-] struggling of all these years, feminism has alrealy [fm1,-] gone a long way towards success.
Society comes to recognize the claims of women's rights equal to those possessed by men.
Women begin to cut [vp2,1-2] smart figures in all fields.
There are more and more successful woman [np3,-1] scientists, artists, journalists, and even politists [fm2,-] in recent years.
In the fields which used to be regarded as man's privilege, women are making contribution not less than men.
For example, in the past, women in many countries were forbidden to take activities which made them appear in public, especially in muslim [fm3,1-1] countries.
But now, even in these muslim [fm3,1-1] countries, there are several woman [np3,-2] political leaders, and they are doing a good job.
It was impossible in China a century ago that a woman had the right to refuse the marriage imposed on her by her parents, that she could refuse to become a life-long widow if her husband died without society's condemnation.
However, in today's China, people feel natural if they know that some [np9,-1] woman divorces her husband because it is well-known that women have already had the right to choose their companion.
This right was possessed only by men in old times.
In Turky [fm1,-] where women were always forbidden to show any part of their body except eyes in public occasions [wd5,2-] women are adopting some western custume [fm1,-] to beautify themselves.
Women's legal rights have been claimed after centuries of oppression from religious dogmas.
Whenever new-born things mad [fm1,-] their appearences [fm2,-] there is always great pain.
The same is the case of feminism.
The history of feminism is a history of struggling and overcoming unfavorable conditions.
Every step they take is surely confronted with strong objections, which will certainly bring difficulty to the cause of women.
It is not out of expectation.
For instance, feminists' effort has gained much job opportunities for women, but new problems arise.
Women have to deal with a series of new problems as soon as they get their long-aspired [fm2,-] freedom and rights.
They are now almost free from chores, but the old relationship with their family has to be changed or even destroyed, which doesn't mean happiness at all.
They now have their right to work, but at the same time the privilege of women are [vp3,3-2] also deprived of.
In the past, women enjoy [vp6,3-] much convenience when having child [np6,1-] Nowadays, women are given [vp1,s-] [vp7,-] [cc2,s-s-] to know that they must take responsibility as man do [vp3,2-] Thus their maternity leave becomes as short as possible.
In [wd4,s-] society, they are not in a position to be protected and taken care of by men, but they have to take care of themselves now.
Furthermore, in some cases, because of prejudice, women are treated even more unfairly.
All that has been written shows the unfavorable conditions of feminism, but they are temporary.
They are the troubles whose solvement [fm2,-] will lead to success, because the essence of feminism is perfectly correct.
In addition, the achievement of feminists is also a plausible proof of their contribution to the cause of women.
Through this movement, human beings will make a [np7,1-1] important step towards equality.
Regarding long-term happiness, we will undoutedly [fm1,-] choose feminists as our pioneers to make benifit [fm1,-] for women and for human beings.
(b2w-t9-5) Feminists have played an important role in promoting the social status of women.
But today, their activities have been bringing damages to the cause of women.
First, feminists appeal for eqality [fm1,-] between man and woman, ignoring social divisions.
As we know, many jobs can be done better by man than by woman.
But many are in nature the speciality [fm1,-] of women.
It doesn't mean any difference in social status, but in social division.
If any woman assumes that the jobs dominated by men show high social status, she can try to do it.
If she can't do it well, she should not have any complaint.
But feminists have the prejudice that [wd4,s-] society offers unequal chance and right for man and woman [pp1,3-] namely [wd4,s-] society favours man instead of woman.
What they think about influences a great deal in women's mind.
So many women don't do the work they are fit for while taking the job they can't necessarily do well.
Second, feminists think that women's rights should be specially protected.
They set up many organizations in the name of protecting women's rights.
Actually, it is redundant to do so.
It is known to all that people are equally protected by law, regardless of man or woman.
As for casual violation of women's rights, women can resort to the law.
So, we can safely say that women are enjoying equal rights today.
What's more, women tend to have advantage over man [np6,6-] Maybe in the future man will launch a movement of man's emancipation.
Is there anyone who wants to see such a matter?
Definitely not.
It will do nothing good to [wd4,s-] society but to waste [vp4,s-] time and money.
On the whole, it's needless to specially advocate the protection of Women's rights today.
It will be better for women's cause if feminists stop appealing for women's equal rights which are actually equal.
(t10-1) Two hundred years ago, some distinguished people brought forth on the North American continent, a new nation, dedicated [cc3,-3] to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Two hundred years later, people all over the world still struggle for equality.
In a sense, we might say that, all men are equal, but some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Firstly, to some extent, it appears that all men are equal.
Human beings, male or female, tall or short, plump or slim, beautiful or ugly, clever or stupid, are equal.
Not a single person can escape from death.
Not a single person can live without air.
Not a single person can fly to Mars without a space shuttle.
Because we belong to the same species, we are [wd4,1-1] same, we are equal.
All of us have the desire for eating and drinking.
All of us live on the earth and shone [vp7,s-] by the sun.
However, we are not exactly the same.
In addition, we have a lot of differences.
That is to say, we are not equal all the time.
Inequality comes from everywhere.
Although we must die at last, some people were cut off in the prime of their youth, while others lived to over one hundred.
Although you worked much harder than your boss, you suffered from poverty while he continued to lavish with money.
For a long time, black people served as slaves while white people who are [vp6,s-] slave-owners enjoyed wealth without working.
For a long time, women were deprive [vp9,2-] [vp1,2-5] the right of being educated, and, in some Arabian countries, they were forced to cover their face with veil when going out.
According to the law, diplomats, who was [vp3,2-] [vp6,s-s-] convicted of murder in the [np7,s-2] foreign country, are free from punishment.
You will not deny the facts above.
There can be no doubt that, some people are really more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The attractive goal of equality have [vp3,5-] not yet been achieved.
When thousands of ordinary people were in danger because of disaster, war and threat of violence, President Clinton stayed comfortably in the White House, with hundreds of bodyguards around him.
Furthermore, not Clinton but the state was to pay this bill.
Because he is [wd4,2-1] president, and [wd5,s-] he is more equal [aj3,1-] than you.
Beause [fm1,-] he is [wd4,2-1] president, he can exercise a power of veto of the decrees while you can just obey.
In the United States, only those who are backed up by millionares [fm1,-] could probably be elected as the candidate [np3,s-] for president [wd3,s-] So men of means are more equal [aj3,1-] than you.
Racial discrimination is proved to be the most suitable illustration to demonstrate the problem of inequality.
At present, negroes [fm3,-] in South Africa and some other places still suffered [vp6,s-] from discrimination and segregation.
They don't have as many equal rights as white people do.
They have been tortured; they have been looked down upon; they have been driven from the schools.
In America, citizens of colors [np5,2-] tend to have less oportunity [fm1,-] of accessing the higher social class.
Because they are judged by their color of skin but not their content [wd7,d]  In conclusion, in a sense all men are equal.
But in fact, some are really more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
(t10-2) Despite the saying: "All men are created equal", no absolute equality exists among human beings, whether in China or in other countries.
There are always some who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Power corruption is a worldwide problem.
Those in power exchange it for money or convenience.
In a seaside city of China, the ex-mayor was so powerful that no one dared to accuse him of power abusing.
He owned a beautiful modern house and had a huge bank account.
His salary couldn't provide him with these things.
The money, of course, came from back-door or other improper means.
His two sons both engaged in smuggling.
The customs knew, but did not check [wd3,-] them.
They were the privileged class.
Because they had power plus money, they were more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Only when their father fell out of power were they arrested.
It was reported that of the smuggling cases, at least 50% involved the government organizations, state-owned companies or even China's foreign offices abroad.
In some cases, the public fund was used to smuggle.
The smugglers met less trouble by securing the power protection [cc1,1-] .
Things are no better abroad.
Political scandals --- mostly the exchange of power for money or the other way around, are so common in Japan that its people lose confidence in the government.
Nothing can illustrate "some people are more equal than others" better than the American presidential election.
The US constitution declares that every citizen has the right to vote and be voted.
The truth is, unless one has strong financial support, he can never hope to be voted.
For a common US citizen, he has to work at least 10 years for a house of his own.
Then he raises a family and lives from hand to mouth.
He can never hope to possess that enormous sums [np3,s-] of money to run the presidential election.
There is no fair play.
"This is understandable", someone said, "otherwise, what's the use of money and power?
Share it with the public?
Work for it?
Almost impossible!
" The same is with education.
If one has enough money, he can buy himself an education.
He is more equal [aj3,1-] than those who have not.
Diplomats stationed in other countries enjoy a special right: They can commit crimes without being punished.
The most [aj1,-s-] they get is to be expelled.
They are more equal [aj3,1-] than others before the law.
In fact, the same goes for almost every field of life, in the past or at present, here and abroad.
George Orwell summarized it: All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
(t10-3) "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others".
This shocking slogan comes from Animal Farm and it is a typical black humor.
Those clever animals, or somebody else, creat [fm1,-] the usage --- more equal, [aj3,1-] knowing that they are smearing the innocent word.
I cannot help being stunned by their intelligence, they are skillful language-users and can express their ideas in a way beyond our imagination.
I, like the rest of the world, am so naive that I only know "unequal" before I come across "more equal".
 [aj3,1-] But now I know more.
(the "more" here is not the "more" in "more equal" [aj3,1-] ) [pr1,-] It reminds me of somebody, or to be exactly [wd2,2-] some country.
Before it got independence, freedom and equality, it exclaimed to the whole world that it would struggle for them [pr1,s-s-] at any price.
"Let's fight for justice" --- it's right, we are born equal, we are endowed with the rights to fight for the rights we deserve.
So people all over the world stood up to support it, they sent all they had to help it: their food, clothes, medicine, even their husbands and sons.
And they at last brought it to the sunlit path of equality.
It succeed [vp6,1-] and became a young and powerful country.
But now its greedy heart said [vp6,4-] to itself that it wanted [vp6,s-] more, maybe at the very begining [fm2,-] it said so, we don't know It wanted [vp6,s-] more rights, or another word "more equal [aj3,1-] ".
It wanted [vp6,s-] to be equal in using other countries' natural resources as those countries themselves.
And it also wanted [vp6,s-] to be equal in governing other countries as their own governments.
That's what "more equal [aj3,1-] " means.
It caused [vp6,s-] the world-wide condemnation.
And now it had got [vp6,s-] what it deserved as it's rewarding [wd7,s-] and I think I needn't point out its name, let it become the history and let's forget it.
But we just cannot forget it.
The arroundings [fm1,-] are repeating the same story in various ways.
Even from a single person we can see the shadow of "more equal" [aj3,1-] The most common "more equal [aj3,1-] " are [vp3,5-] corruption.
I don't know if we can say "more corrupt", but surely some are corrupt enough to be called "more corrupt" if we have this usage.
Some high government officials make full use of their rights to be "more equal [aj3,1-] ".
They live in villas and when they go out they use cars, their sons or daughts [fm1,-] also share the "more equality" to make more money.
It's unfair and dangerous, "government of the people, by the people and for the people" should be the most just [aj3,2-] and honest government.
Otherwise the people will overturn it.
We have officials in the government in order to control and promote the country, improve people's living standards, not to exploit people.
We have realized it and have done something.
But what remains before us is still a long road.
Because life to everybody is a hard work, composed of laugh [np6,2-2] and tears But the latter one is much more than the former.
So be kind to others as well as to oneself [wd3,s-] Struggle for one's equality, and when you enjoy it don't forget to treat others equally.
Someone just cannot bear [vp1,-s-] that sun shines on everybody.
In that case he'd better go into the basement to have his own special right of enjoying darkness.
We are all children of God.
We are brothers and sisters.
We should remember: we are equal, no one is less equal, and no one is more equal [aj3,1-] 
(t10-4) Equality has been long saught [fm1,-] after ever since mankind was conscious of its indispensibility [fm2,-] as one of the nuclei of human rights.
Human beings long for equality which they believe [wd4,s-] destined.
This can be best examplified [fm1,-] by that notable Declaration of Indepence [fm1,-] in 1774 in which the fourteen Bristish [fm1,-] colonies in North America advanced the idea as to [pp1,1-5] all men are created equal.
But, more than two decades have now passed, and I am forced to say that mankind is still lumbering on its way to the paradise of equality.
History has seen too many tragedies in which devotees of equality fall victims to the antithetic forces mounted by those frantic authoritarians who cling to the notion that still some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than the other [pr3,7-] if they will agree that all men are equal at all.
This is the notion reflected in one of George Orwell's book [np6,4-] : The Animal Farm.
The book recounts the ups and downs of an animal farm where rebellion finally broke out when the high-pressure rule of the animal king was unbearable.
But the animals did not enjoy the expected peace and happiness after they turned over the king because the new king, one used to be among them, turned out to be even more domineering.
He preached that some were more equal [aj3,1-] than the other [pr3,7-] in the quaint hope of cooling down the mounting furiousness of the mass.
It is easy to draw something common to mankind from this story.
It is impossible for human beings to be equal with each other insofar as personal interest and wealth, together with social status are concerned.
Our world is a material one, but it cannot afford to guarantee equal treatment to every person.
Wealth rains down on the rich; power attaches to the bigwigs; respect goes to the noblemen.
This seems to be the constant scheme of human life.
Can it be possibly altered?
The answer will never be consent [cc4,5-] as long as there are the rich among the majority [cc1,-1] poor.
The answer is no as long as someone sits on the very top of a humble group brandishing his symbolic cane.
The answer will never be yes unless the world drips with abundant wealth and opportunity for everyone's demand.
Every nation has been striving for a more secure and prosperous vista.
In the course of developing economy and building up strength, nations on the earth and people of these nations should bear in mind the age-old desire for equality which is still languishing for full blossom one day.
But for the time being, a material prosperity throughout the world, which is one of the essential basis for valid equality, has not yet appeared.
With this respect [pp2,2-] equality can just be a good wish for all concerned and some people in certain corners of the globe still has [vp3,s-] to face discrimination; be content with oppression, and wallow in despair.
Let's pray for those suffering.
Let the world grant them a wish for the best: be equal at last --- one divinist [fm2,-] thing World has not possessed.
(t10-5) After the liberation, the Chinese people became the host [np3,5-] of the country.
Later, the constitution was promulgated, providing that all citizens are equal.
But I would like to say that in China today, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
What on earth makes the Chinese unequal?
Power and money.
Though the Chinese Communist Party had made great resolution [np6,2-] to root out the leader's abusing their power, the problem is till very serious.
Quite a number of Party members and leaders ignore the party discipline and the law of the state.
They make good us [fm1,-] of their privilege to get what they want.
Their families and relatives can also enjoy many privileges.
It's very easy for them to enter some good institute or state-run company.
Suppose you are the head of the institute you'd better not to infringe upon their privileges if you don't want to meet the trouble [cc3,2-] I learn that in the Silk Corperation [fm1,-] of the Foreign Trade Committee in Dong Guang city, there is about half of the stuff [wd3,s-] who are the leader's [np6,s-] families or relatives.
Most of them are not needed at all.
The leadership of the corperation [fm1,-] have to find some work to be done by them.
Then, it comes out that a work [np5,1-] which should be done by one person was divided into 3 parts and done by 3 persons.
All this trouble was taken to please some leaders.
On the country [fm1,-] if you were a common people, even you had college certification, and you are [vp8,s-] exactly the company [np4,1-1] need, it would still be very difficult for you to enter [vp1,s-] into it.
So, the leaders and their relatives are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The second cause of unequality [fm2,-] is: money.
Suppose you had a child who were at the age of 3 or 4, and should go to kindergarton [fm1,-] Of course, it's quite normal that every parent want [vp3,2-] [vp1,-s-] their child has [vp4,3-] the best education.
But if you had not quite a lot of money, you shouldn't hope that your child can [vp8,s-] stay in the best one [pr1,s-] It needs money to bribe the board of the kindergarton [fm1,-] so that your child could be received.
It also needs money to pay your child's cost in the kindergarton [fm1,-] which is not cheap at all.
If you had not so much money, you can [vp8,s-] only sent [vp9,2-] your child to a bad, or at least, not so good one.
Then, your child grown [vp5,s-] up, it's time for him to go to university.
Unfortunately, he failured [fm2,-] in the Entering College Exam.
If you had money, you could still help him to receive the college educaion [fm1,-] But if you couldn't support the extra expenditure --- which is really a large sum for a common worker --- your child would have no choice, he could only enter sociaty [fm1,-] to earn his living.
The gap between the rich and the poor is exit [wd3,1-] The rich is more equal [aj3,1-] than the others.
Insofar as I am concerned, I don't think the unequality [fm2,-] will disappear in the near future.
Perhaps there will be real equality in the communist society?
(t10-6) The famous word of "All men are equal, some are more equal than others" is really an alternative way to say "not all the men are equal".
It is very true today if we cast our eyes on the society we are living in.
When we look at the whole world, it may not be difficult for us to discover that some men are more equal [aj3,1-] than others as concerning the colors [np5,s-] of them.
When God decided to create human being, he created inequality in advance.
He intentionally made them into different colors.
So we have white, yellow, black, brown peoples.
Then he even unfairly and unreasonably put them to different circumstances, providing the whites with the fertile plains, favourable climate, fat sheep and horses and rich natural resources and the blacks with barren deserts and a harsh living condition.
This is the inequality in Nature, it is not directed by any human's will.
But deplorably enough, thousands of years passing away, the deep-rooted racial unjustice [fm1,-] and inequality are still popular.
This time, the God is far beyond reproach.
So we have Martin Luther King's influential nation-wide boycott asking for equal rights in 1960s.
Still today, people were [vp6,2-] shocked by the nutorious [fm1,-] scandle [fm1,-] of Rodney King's case which happened in Los Angles, the USA, a country that is long viewed as the beacon of freedom and democracy.
To say nothing of these so-called less democratic nations.
Let's look at the condition in Somali, a country which is almost destroyed by hunger and wars.
Its people are starving to death.
Plagues and femine [fm1,-] are wide-spreaded [fm2,-] Every morning they wake up and find that they are living in the great terror of being killed or starved.
These people are even deprived of the most fundamental right of a person --- the right of life, how can they be equal to others?
Even within the same racial society, we still have many "big" men who are alway [fm1,-] more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
It is no doubt that every democratic government declares in their constitution "All men should be equal.
" While [wd5,s-] as far as wealthy [wd2,3-4] social position are involved, this can not be true.
Every society has its privileged class which is made up of a number of big fish.
They usually get more economic opportunities and political advantages which can not be obtained by every common countryman.
This year, in Indonisia [fm1,-] the names of the ten richest person [np3,3-] in the country have been put in order to show to the public.
Not surprisingly, there out of the ten are the children of Mr Suhato, the nation's president.
More [wd3,s-] I do not deny their ability to become rich.
But I would not doubt that they were less likely to be as they are now if they didn't have any strong support behind.
So no matter in what society, the absolute equality is impossible.
Maybe the beautiful dream of "All men are equal" is always a distant destination for us to strive for.
(t10-7) In his novel "ANIMAL FARM", George Orwell told us that the oppressed animals rose up and overthrown [vp4,s-] the Black Pig, a crude, unjust, violent tyrant.
More significantly, they destroyed the board on which "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" was written.
It was true that the board had been pushed over, but it is also true that the words on it did not rot away with the wooden board, and it is still appliable [fm2,-] today.
"All men are equal" is a long-lasting dream for which so many people, both in [wd4,1-1] west and in [wd4,1-1] east, have fought.
One can find many examples in history: The American in the Independence War, the Negroes in the Civil War and the oppressed and exploited Chinese in the Liberation War all fought bravely and hard to win their equal rights.
The aged-old [fm2,-] dream has always been in all men's heart and still will be as long as they exist.
For even today, "all men are equal" remains a hope.
It is till true that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Those who own power are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
They take advantage of the power they seized or given to them by people.
Once they held any leading position, they think themselves superior [aj2,-1] than others, ordering others to do what they like, not considering others' interests.
Furthermore, if ther [fm1,-] are objected [vp1,s-] or protested [vp1,s-] they would, within the region of their power, use all kinds of means to force his will to be obeyed.
So, it produces an unequal scene: some men are above others.
Such a condition easily leads to corruption which is existing among any government.
Let's have Japan as an example.
Nearly during every term of government, there were some corruption scandles [fm1,-] some of which led to the fall of the government.
If some figures in the government, who of course have [vp6,s-] certain power, were not more equal [aj3,1-] than others, who would have sent money to them and bid [vp1,s-] them for help?
Apart from the persons who have power, the rich are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Nowadays, the world is more and more dominated by money, which means that the more money you have, the more rights you have and the more equal [aj3,1-] you are.
Look at those millionaires, who can go from the U.S. to Swiss to have a holiday while ordinary workers are working hard to make a living.
If they are in the mood, they can buy all the tickets of an amusement park for one night and enjoy themselves madly, just like the popular singer Mickle Jackson, which may deprive so many others of their happiness of playing in that park that night.
In some places, enough money enables you to do whatever you like, including even committing crimes without punishment.
Therefore, it is obvious that they are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
In some strange conditions, some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others merely because of their colour of skin, even though they are neither rich nor having any power.
Martin L King's dream hasn't fully realized.
A world in which all men are equal remains a dream in everybody's heart.
When will it become true?
(t10-8) "Every [wd3,-3] people are equal, but some people are more equal.
" This is a famous saying from the film "Animals' Farm".
Till now, the condition this sentence described is still commonly seen around the world.
Perhaps we can learn something from it.
The United States, the most advanced country in the world, also the so-called "most democratic place" At the beginning of its history, the founders had written clearly about the human rights: "Every [wd3,-3] people are born equal.
" These words have also inspired a lot of people to fight for their equal rights, like the American Revolution, the Civil War, the two world wars.
Indeed the democracy has thus been pushed forward greatly.
But on the other hand, we have to admit that even here some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
For example, the law stipulated that everyone could elect or be elected.
But the fact is that only the millionaires or politicians supported by powerful financial groups can afford the amazingly high expense of election.
Furthermore, even if you want to vote, the value of your property must reach [wd4,-2] certain standard.
Once they're elected as the congressman [np3,4-] they can enjoy a lot of privileges immediately, such as having free dinners, free transportation, free accomondations [fm1,-] etc.
They indulge in luxury and extravagance all day and all night.
In contrast with this, a large number of poor people are on the edge of starvation.
In addition, the blacks and the whites are not equal, either.
Racial discrimination has always been a serious social problem.
Although they have fought for over 200 years, their miserable fates haven't any change.
They are forbidden to enter the door of great opportunities and therefore can only do the dirtiest, hardest job.
Some day, I'm sure, the volcano of anger of these blacks, who have been kept at the bottom of the society, will explode.
In our country we can also meet a lot of such kind [np6,4-] of "more equal [aj3,1-] " people.
Most of them hold high position [np6,2-1] in the government or state-owned companies.
They take full use of their power to seek extra profits, like taking bribes, finding good jobs for their relatives, spending [vp2,-6] country's [np6,s-] money on travelling, eating, going abroad, etc.
Now, our social legal system isn't strong enough.
Sometimes some leader's words are the law.
If the leaders' children break the law, they can easily escape the punishment freely.
All these exert very bad influence among the public [pp1,2-] From [wd4,1-2] above examples, we can clearly see that at every corner of our world the "more equal [aj3,1-] " people all exist.
So it's necessary for us to change this unfair situation.
First, I think, the central government should pay [vp2,-3] more attention on this matter and get those more equal [aj3,1-] ones out of the leadership.
Secondly, the media and the public should supervise and expose the repulsive deeds of the officials as soon as possible.
Thirdly, everyone should make good examples [np3,4-1] themselves.
(t10-9) In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others".
As far as I see it, this statement is still perfectly true in the present world.
First of all, the unequality [fm2,-] derives from an imbalance in [wd4,1-3] distribution of wealth.
In this world, there are both people as rich as billionairs [fm1,-] and people as poor as church mice.
Consequently, they cannot enjoy equal rights both in material and in democracy.
It is obvious to say that people are not equal in wealth.
As for democracy, we can take the judicial system as an example to see how unequality [fm2,-] goes on in this aspect.
If a rich person is accused of a certain crime, firstly he is able to afford the usually high bail and to wait for the trial outside prison.
Then, an expensive but eloquent and competent attorney may help him to reduce [vp1,-5] the sentence several years shorter or even prove him innocent, though he does commit something guilty.
However, a poor person may not be so lucky.
His empty pocket may even put his life to an end as well.
There is no need to mention how many rich people bribe or threaten witnesses, so far we can see that the rich and the poor are not equal.
Then, let us look at what happen between civilians and government officials.
Once mankind has power to administer others, he will abuse it more or less without doubt.
Corruption and accepting bribes are common practice throughout the world.
Certainly there are impartial officials as well.
But people under their control always like to regard [vp1,-6] them as more superior [aj3,1-] [aj2,-] than them and try every means to please them, expecting they can get favour [cc3,1-] from them one day.
In term of this division of labour of [wd4,1-1] society, people are not equal either.
Next reflection of unequality [fm2,-] lies between different races, racial discrimination is mostly existing in white people dominating countries with a multi-race background.
In these countries, though the human rights of its [pr3,4-] citizens of colour has been improved a lot through the ages, there is still a long way to go.
Two years ago, a negro [fm3,-] was beaten to death by the policemen in Los Angeles.
This violation had [vp6,d] aroused indignation and outcry of the public.
However, this is only one of the most distinctive examples from numerous acts of racial discrimination in various ways.
Many white people seem still to be unable to reject the idea of despising people of another colour totally because of traditional, cultural and economic reasons.
To put the foresaid three [wd1,4-1] aspects to a nutshell, though all the governments in the world alledge [fm1,-] their countries to a free, equal and franternal [fm1,-] one, many unequal phenomena cannot be totally got rid of after all.
Though the slogan of "all men are equal" is prevailing for many year [np3,1-] there are still some people who are "more equal [aj3,1-] than the others", even if it is all too bad for us to admit it.
(t10-10) People in each country of the world have struggle [vp9,1-] for freedom and equality for hundreds of years, and it is now nearly the end of the 20 century.
What is the situation today?
Have all the people got equality?
Are all men are [wd6,s-] equal today?
If these questions were raised fifty years ago, you could easily find the answer from a newly-published novel named Animal Farm, written by a Russian writer.
In the novel it said "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.
" Actually, these words illustrated the human right situation in the Sovil [fm1,-] Union of the day, and also that of the world.
Fifty years have passed now, and the world have [vp3,2-] changed a lot.
Are these word [np3,1-] still be [wd5,s-] true?
To me, I will say yes.
Here I am not denying that in each country of the world more and more people have got their equality, and great progress has been made in the equality of man.
But it is still not enough.
Still in every country, no matter socialism or capitalism, there are some people more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
There are many causes for this phenomenent [fm2,-] Here I would like to mention three, which are common and tipical [fm1,-] The first reason leads [vp4,s-] to the unequalness [fm1,-] is the unequal distribution of poverty [wd3,s-] The current distribution system is enlarging the gap between the rich and the poor.
The rich is becoming richer, and the poor is becoming poorer.
Although according to the law, the rich and the poor are all civilian [np3,s-] of a country, and have the same rights and [wd4,s-] legally equal.
In real life, they are not equal at all.
The richer a person is, the more equal [aj3,1-] he will be.
This conclusion can be proved by a simply [wd2,1-1] example.
A man is accused for [wd3,4-] shoplifting, if he is rich, he can engage the best lawyer or bribe the judge, and he may be free after paying some fine.
But for a poor [wd4,2-1] who committed [vp6,s-] the same crime, he has no money to engage a lawyer or bribe the judge, so he has to be in prison for several years.
The second reason is that in [wd5,s-] nowadays there are two different stratum [np3,2-] in the society.
One is formed by the group of people who have power in hand.
In other words, it is formed by officials.
The other stratum, of course, is formed by civilians.
The more power one has, the more equal [aj3,1-] he will be.
Power is a kind of commodity between the officials.
A president of a company can give a good position to the son of a government official who is in charge of tax exchanging for lower taxes than other company [np6,s-] And a mayor can promise to a judge that he would help him become the chief if he gives his nephew who committed a crime a lenient punishment.
The last reason is the difference between different country [np6,1-] different culture [np6,1-] and different races.
The last one is the main cause of the racial discrimination, which is becoming a great obstacle for mankind to reach the hill-top of the equality of man.
Some races, which is [vp3,3-] less developed or had been [vp6,s-] in lower position in history, is [vp3,s-] now being discriminated and unequally treated.
In a same nation, they cannot have the same right like other dominating races have.
To sum up, people are becoming more equal [aj3,1-] today, but we still have a long way to go.
Various of [wd5,1-1] reasons have made us unable to achieved [vp4,1-] the target our forerunners had struggled for for ages today.
So long as these problems such as the unequal distribution of poverty [wd3,s-] or the commodity of power [wd7,3-] between official [np6,1-] or the racial discrimination exist, the world will never be equal, and the saying "All men are equal, but some are more equal than other" will always be true.
(t10-11) Have you ever seen the film "Animal Farm" adapted by Georgy [fm1,-] Orwell?
It's a famous cartoon reflecting the political situation of the former Soviet Union during its communist revolution time in 1917.
In this film, there is a famous saying which was [vp6,s-] stuck out by the black pig when he finally seized [vp6,s-] power.
That is, "All men are equal, but some one [fm2,1-] are [vp3,2-] more equal than others!
" And for all the cartoon's artistic exaggeration and fabrication, this sentence is true and still effective in today's world.
First, on a world-wide scale, some countries are indeed more equal [aj3,1-] than others!
America, who [pr5,1-] boasts its indispensable role as a "world police", is at all times interferring [fm2,-] with others' internal affairs.
Putting sanctions against those who refuse to obey his orders, or lifting embargos [fm2,-] on [wd3,2-] the countries finally giving up their positions, Uncle Sam is watching impatiently for his chance to put this world under control.
However, it does not stop here.
The United Nations, which is a comprehensive body formed with members of most nations in the world and supposed to deal with the international affairs just [wd2,5-] and fairly, is finally turned [vp7,s-] out to be a "magic word" played by the superpowers on a wide political stage.
On the other hand, the third world, now struggling its way for a better life, is not only dragged by the backward economy and low-leveled education, but also bearing an overwhelming pressure created by some so-called international "peace-keeping troups [fm1,-] ".
In this case, it's hard for the people of these countries to keep territorial integrity and maintain political independence, let along [vp2,s-] human rights and social democracy!
They are simply the dreams far beyond average person's reach and only appear on the screen when the arragant [fm1,-] westerners use them as weapons to attack their opponents.
Second, on a nation-wide scale, it's been a common knowledge [np5,2-] for people to hear the talks of power-abusing, duty-corrupting or bribery-accepting by some high-level officials up to the nameless self-employed laborers [wd7,s-] Most of these people either occupy an important position in the government organization, or enjoy some reputation in the literary and art circles, or simply have a fairly large fortune in the bank.
It's them who make up a "noble class" in contemporary China, and now are regarded as [wd4,s-] superior to those ordinary citizens in terms of ease and comfort.
Compared with these "rich people", the teachers, intellectuals and workers are simply leading a "miserable" life which is carefully budgeted only to have both ends meet.
However, despite their poor income and low social status, we must admit, they are the backbone of our nation and should be paid [vp1,-s-] more respect as well as rewardings [fm2,-] for their life-long devotions [np5,2-3] to this society!
Now, with the famous words "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others" echoing back in mind it could be figured out that this not only [ad1,s-] reflects the past, but also the present, and I hope, it won't fulfill a same future!
(t10-12) Thousands of years had past [wd3,4-] till some brave and opimistic [fm1,-] British men announced publicly that "All men a [fm1,-] created equal" in 1689.
Three hundred years have gone now since we dedicated to that proposition.
We have got great progress, as we all know, that [wd5,s-] we almost demolished kings or queens and it is written down in most nations' constitutions that all men are equal.
Can we boast of our feat and engage in the luxury of cooling off, thinking that we will get our final success soon?
No!
It is true that all men are equal now but it is more true [aj3,1-] that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Man is far away from his most beautiful goal --- real and complete equality.
In this equal world, lots of people are still concerned on [aj2,3-] the colors [np5,s-] of them [pr1,s-] and racial discrimination still exist [vp3,3-] It is quite obviously [wd2,3-2] if you put your view on South Affrica [fm1,-] where black [np6,s-] still can not enjoy the same rights as white [np6,s-] Even in the United States, the freest and equalest [aj3,-] nation, black [np6,s-] dose [fm1,-] not match [vp2,3-3] to the white totally.
Usually blacks get poorer education and living condition [np6,s-] Their social position are [vp3,3-] lower.
They are still crippled by the chains of discrimination and suffered [vp6,s-] police brutality.
While Martin Luther King died with his great dream thirty years ago in Losangel [fm1,-] a fierce racial conflict broke out for the same reason King worried about.
Apart from the racial unequality [fm1,-] man also face [vp3,2-] the problem of wealth.
Fortunately, in this equal world some men are rich and some are poor.
This difference is becoming more and more bigger [aj3,1-] So we have five stars hotel as well as the benches in the parks.
So we have the comfortable country villa with the shabby cabin in the ghetto.
So we have tender beefsteak and black bread.
A rich [wd4,2-1] can pay a fine in stead [fm2,1-] of go [vp4,] to jail.
A rich [wd4,2-1] can employ the best doctor and a rich [wd4,2-1] can even sometimes destroy a poor [wd4,2-3l] with his money, if he like [vp3,2-] The third thing I want to mention is the equality between men and women.
Nowadays, thanks to the Women Liberation Movement, women get lots of rights from their rivals, but women are in some ways still in a subordinate position like before [pp1,1-] They do the same work as men but be [vp9,s-] paid little.
Their promotions are more difficult and rarer compared with the males.
Wives must take their husbands' names and they usually do most of [wd4,2-1] housework no matter who earned [vp6,s-] bread.
It is common to see husband [np6,-s-] enjoy [vp3,2-] reading [wd4,-2] evening newspaper while his wife is washing dishes.
Furthermore, in lots of places, women [np3,s-] is just a subject of men.
The only duty of her is to satified [fm1,-] her man's sexal [fm1,-] request and product [wd2,-1] children.
In these places people sometimes will kill femal [fm1,-] baby [np6,2-] for their inclinations of boy [np6,1-] It is said that "even a cat can face the king", but I am sure if this cat annoys the king he will easily has [vp9,3-] this cat's head cut down.
In our equal world, there are some people decide to fight with the neighber [fm2,-] country and it is some others who have to pick up guns.
So, accord [vp5,-2] to these, I must say that equality has not down [wd3,-] with all God's children.
"All men are equal" is a dream for us to try to realise.
We still have a long way to go before we can sing together happily "Equal at last, equal at last, thanks [np2,-2] God almighty [47plncprg] we are equal at last!
" (t10-13) In Geroge [fm1,-] Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" I think this is still true today.
Let's not discuss the racial discrimination existing in some countries for the present.
We just take a common social phenomenon as an example.
It can be said as a world-wide phenomenon.
So as a large country in the world, China face [vp3,s-] this question as well.
After a long-termed [fm2,-] hard struggle, Chinese people gained freedom and the equal right, especially in the recent years, with the implementation of the Open Policy and other enlighterned [fm1,-] policies, Chinese economy is raising at a stunning speed, and Chinese people have a stable life.
But we have to admit that the people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others are still existence [wd2,2-] These men can be divided into two kinds.
One is the men who possess authority.
Most of them hold an important post or a lucrative post.
It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] look down upon the average person [cc1,1-] , and think that they are the men of noble birth; It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] solve some sticky questions easily which common people treat as difficult ones; It is the authority [np1,-1] that they [pr5,-] always are accorded courteous reception wherever they go, and their relatives and friends also benefit from them.
So, it appears that the average people are sweating in packed buses, while they are glacing [fm1,-] over streets through the dark brown window of their luxury cars; the average person [np3,s-] are lining up for tickets while they are dialling [fm1,-] gracefully; the average person [np3,s-] are rushing about simpal [fm1,-] things while they sign their names skilfully on brief informal note [np6,3-] All these privilege [np3,2-] separate them from the mass and make them more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The other kind is the rich men.
Though they haven't authority like the former one, as they have money, they can share the privilege as well.
As they have money, they can solve sticky questions under the help of expensive gifts.
As they have money, they can buy all kinds of special service and convienence [fm1-] In people's views, these rich men are also more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Today's society is developing speedly [fm2,-] and at the same time, our country is trying it's [wd3,1-1] best to suit this development with perfecting it's [24cyzsbrc] rules and regulations.
So during this period, though the unreasonable phenomenons [fm2,-] like these are still exist [vp9,s-] we believe that they will be eliminated one day, and we look forward to the coming of that day.
(t10-14) In George Orwell's novel "Animal Farm", he wrote that "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" Scores of years have passed since then, however, this still proves to be true today.
It is said that all men are born equal, regardless of their race, color, sex and nationality etc..
If this is true, there should be [wd4,d] slavery, segregation and sexual injustice.
The reality is: some men, most from the dominent [fm1,-] class in the society, regard themselves as more equal [aj3,1-] men, as the privileged class.
They do whatever they like, ignoring the law, ignoring the social conventions.
Look at the status of American negro [fm3,-] Segregation will always exist as long as the whites still bear the thought in mind that they are the dominent [fm1,-] class, they are more equal [aj3,1-] than the negros [fm2,-] [fm3,-] In such a deteriorating society, you are judged not by the content of your character but simply by the color of your skin.
A negro [fm3,-] does not have the equal rights in politics, economy and culture as a white man has.
It is the law that has promised the equal rights for all races.
It is also the law that sentences criminals of different races in a different way.
A court may sentence a negro [fm3,-] to death for a sin for which a white man will only be sentenced to one or two years' imprisonment.
Racial differences makes [vp3,2-] unequal rights.
This is the case not only in the States, but in almost every country around the world.
Go back to China.
Pick up a newspaper [wd4,s-] you will easily find a criminal case of corruption.
It is known to all that lots of government officials, along with their families, lead luxurious and corrupt lives, becoming the privileged class in the society.
They make full use of their powers to seek for their own interests.
They do this by hook or by crook, even by committing crimes.
They are not afraid of any punishment, for they have the so-called "relation web" which will protect them quite well.
They seem to be more equal [aj3,1-] than the ordinary people.
Not until these social moth [np3,2-] have been eliminated will our society has [vp9,s-] a bright future, will our people lead a happy life, enjoying the equal rights the law has promised them.
Take a look at the joint-venture enterprises in Guangdong province [fm3,-] , you will probably be shocked by the unfair treatment of millions of workers who have come to Guangdong to fulfil their dreams of success.
They have contributed a lot to the rapid development of the economy.
But what have they got?
They haven't been guaranteed the basic rights of payment, safety and freedom.
They are just treated as cheap labor [wd3,s-] [wd4,s-] even working machines.
Eighty-one workers, most [wd4,1-] from northern provinces, lost their lives in the great fire which broke out a few days ago.
How could this tragedy happen?
Because there isn't any fire-fighting equipments [np5,-] in the factory at all.
Because they have [vp6,s-] been locked in the workshop by their boss so [wd5,s-] what they could do was only to wait to die.
Where are their rights of safety and freedom then?
Who is to be blamed for this tragedy, their capitalist boss or our socialist law which has promised every citizen equal rights in labour?
When and how will such unequality [fm2,-] in all aspects be completely wiped out?
It is true that all men are getting more and more equal [aj3,1-] with the development of the society and the expansion of democracy in our lives.
But we have to admit that unequality [fm2,-] still exist [vp3,3-] almost everywhere.
Surely it needs our great efforts to achieve human equality for all the people.
But we will always cherish the hope of an equal society in our mind, we will always strive for this aim.
(t10-15) In his novel "Animal Farm", George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
" These words were the writers [np4,1-1] irony to some of the leaders of the former Soviet Union.
Those leaders promised people equality and democracy.
But after they gained power, they became dictators.
They had special authorities which others couldn't possess.
Now, the U.S.S.R has collapsed.
Russia has taken the place of it.
But in today's Russia, the phenomenon of breaking promise [np6,s-] and dictatorship still exists.
Russia was set up as a democracy.
At least, Russian President Boris Yeltsin claimed that Russia was a democracy.
Before he was President of Russia, he had preached pluralism in politics.
He criticized [vp1,-s-] the Communist Party monopolizing the politics.
He said the Communist Party should tolerate different opinions and allow other party [np6,2-1] to take part in the election.
His words represented people's wish.
Therefore he was elected the President.
But after he became a President [fm3,1-] he didn't keep his promise.
He behaved in contrast with [pp2,-2] his promise.
About the method of reform, there were different opinions.
Some people preferred a gradual reform.
Some advocated a radical one.
The Russian Parliament supported a gradual reform while the Russian President was in favour of a radical one.
There was controversy between the Parliament and the president.
According to the President's promise, since Russia was a "democracy", any major problem should be determined by [np6,s-1] people.
In stead [fm2,1-] of holding a poll, the President dissolved the parliament.
Without parliament, no one could control his power and oppose his policy.
He became a real dictator.
All people has [vp3,2-] [vp6,d] converged on him.
The parliament didn't obey his order.
Then, he sent troops to surround the parliament building.
He threw the leader of the parliament into prison.
Is this a civil rule?
No.
His power came from the barrel.
Now, he has more power than others.
He can do whatever he like [vp3,1-] without any opposition.
He is more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
The president has advocated pluralism before.
He said different idea should be allowed and opposition party should be allowed to take part in the election.
But before the new parliament election, the president announced that his opponent, Ruslan Khasbulatov, whom he had thrown in prison, was not allowed to take part in the election.
He cracked down on his opponent by military means.
The president will have no opponent in the election.
His party will certainly win.
But all the significance of election will lose because people have only one choice.
The president do [vp3,2-] not have a sense of equality and fairplay [fm1,-] He think [vp3,1-] he is more equal [aj3,1-] than his opponent.
The president don't [vp9,2-] think that he is equal to others.
He defends his interest at the expense of other's rights.
It is impossible for the officials in his government to regard themselves as ordinary citizens.
The officials have the authority to deal with the possession of the country.
They illegally sell some important material at the market to hit big .
This has led to the disorder in economy.
The Russian economy has been declining.
The unemployment rate is soaring and the living standard is falling.
But some people become millionair [fm1,-] in this slack season, of whom 90% are officials.
They become rich because they have more power; because they are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Therefore I think the phenomenon that some are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still exists in today's Russia.
Russia is not a real democracy.
(t10-16) I saw the Animal Farm from the video.
Actually, this was an interesting story.
The screenwriter made use of the animals to reflect the idea and emotion of the human being.
"All animals are equal, no animals kill the other animals.
" This was one of the rules of the animal farm.
But in fact, the animals did not obey this rule.
Some animals were more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Finally, the good animals rose up and wiped out the bad animals.
"I HAVE A DREAM" was an article which I just finished.
This speech was made by Martin Luther King Jr.
In his speech he expressed his strong hope that one day all black people and white people were equal in America.
All that made me sad.
I asked myself why the human being could not unite and live friendly.
I couldn't help thinking of the situation at present.
Maybe I was born in 70's and have not experienced hardships.
I am growing up in a happy environment.
Although, I learnt many things about the old society from my parents Since the policy [wd4,2-2] opening to the outside world was introduced in 1979 and we achieved the comprehensive modernization of agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology.
Living standard was improved.
People work very hard and earn their own money.
Then they use their money to buy services and goods that they like.
Some people even run their own business.
Gradually, you will find you live in a competitive society.
Everybody has rights to compete.
The more money you earn, the more happiness you enjoy.
So I think the idea of unequality [fm2,-] almost disappeared [vp6,s-] The important point is depending on your hard working But in a large factory The problem of [pp1,-s-] some workers are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still remains.
My mother works in a plastics factory.
My mother and some women make packing bag [np6,2-1] of goods in one of the workshops in the factory.
They wire the bag on a piece-rate system.
The more you wire, the more you got [vp6,s-] paid.
The plastics materials are divided into two kinds.
One they call is "soft piece", [wd4,-2] other is "hard piece".
If they get the soft piece, it's more easy [aj3,1-] and quick [aj3,4-] for them to wire bag [np6,2-] In order to make more money, some women flatter the supervisor of the workshop.
They often call on him, bringing a lot of gifts and try their best to please him.
In return, they usually get soft piece and good marks in the monthly report.
My mother disgusts [cc3,-2] this practice, so her pay is lower than others and she felt [vp6,s-] unhappy with her work.
She often blows off steam at home.
My father persuades her to be a yesman.
When I know that I also felt [vp6,s-] very angry.
That's unfair and unequal.
I suggest my mother [vp4,3-] report this bad phenomenon to the factory director, and get [vp4,s-] rid of this bad practice [wd7,s-] I have dream [np6,1-1] now.
I hope one day the millennium will arrive.
All people can live equally.
(t10-17) In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" Though this statement is seemingly ridiculous, it is sadly true.
All men are created equal, as the Bible says.
And some countries have already put it into their constitutions because they regard equality as a most valuable thing.
However, in reality, when all men are crying for equality, inequality has its firm position almost everywhere.
It is not unusual in many countries that a small group of people enjoy higher social status along with more privileges, more freedom and more priorities at the expense of unequal treatment of others.
Nothing, I think, illustrates the inequality between people better than racial discrimination.
In many developed countries which boast of being the most democratic countries, white people always take precedence over colour citizens, especially over black people.
Only because of [wd4,1-2] different colours of their skin from the white, colour citizens have to take harder work and get lower pay.
They have to live in special sections of the city and they have to accept their unsatisfactory living conditions.
Their children can not receive education as high as they want, not because they are not clever enough, but because they have no [wd3,-2] enough money.
Since their children can not receive proper education, they are not likely to get high-paid jobs and improve their living conditions.
So a vicious cycle forms.
Brazil, one of the original homes of black people, has gradually become a white country.
It boasts of no racial segregation as it has no laws against black people.
But the white are taking the lead of this country in its politics and economy.
The black illiterates are twice as many as the white illiterates.
And the black, the poorest people in Brazil, who account for 10% of the population, only possess no more than 1% of [wd4,-2] total wealth.
From this, we can imagine what the life of the black is like in other countries which have stipulations against the black in explicit terms.
Colour citizens are always in the second class of the society.
They give more, but receive much less than they deserve.
Although people have struggled for equality for quite a long time and have made some progress, racial discrimination and racial segregation are still a big social problem.
When can the manacles and chains that have crippled colour people for so long be smashed?
Only if colour people are set free, equality will have truely [fm2,-] come.
Inequality between men and women in this man-dominating society is also remarkable.
Since the Women's Liberation of the 1960s, women's status and conditions has [vp3,4-] attracted increasing attention.
Though women's conditions since then have been greatly improved, women are still far from being equal to men.
You will find the following common: Women get less pay for the same amount of work; women are always sort of discriminated by others while working together with them; and it costs women a lot more to get the same position and so on.
In a word, women have less opportunities to fulfill themselves.
In rural areas of China, many girls are not allowed to receive higher education because their parents consider it useless for girls to receive any higher education.
They think that being helpful in housework or even farmwork is much more valuable than studying any books.
So many girls leave school after graduating from primary schools, or even before their graduation they have to quit.
Apart from the two forms mentioned, inquality [fm1,-] in this society has many other various forms.
It mainly results from unequal distribution of wealth between people and results in unequal economic status, political status, social status, etc., which lead to further inequality.
So, in order to fight against inequality efficiently, people from the lower classes must learn how to gain equal economic status first through every possible measurement.
Then all other things will follow like a stream.
Being equal between all men is a sweet dream, in which "all men will be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness".
Obviously there is still a long way to go, but I believe with everyone's efforts, this dream will come true someday, and by that time all men will be truely [fm1,-] equal.
(t10-18) "That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
" The architects of the America wrote these magnificent words in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
Now, more than 200 years has passed.
Has this wonderful dream of all Americans come true?
Are all American people equal?
When asked to answer this question, I would have nothing to say but "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" It is true that the law of America has recognized that all citizens of America are equal and they all have the same rights, despite of different beliefs, religions, races, educations [np5,-] ...
But it is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note so far as most of the citizens of the country are concerned.
Politically, it is clearly stated in [wd4,1-2] American Law that citizens have this or that kind of right, including the right to run for the presidency.
It seems that people in that country are equal to one another and it is really very fascinating to a lot of people.
However, this is only the specious writing and the superficial phenomenon.
In fact, there are many restrictions to these rights when people are to exercise these rights.
Although the law states that all men are equal to have these rights, no chances are provided for most of the people.
For example, the law says that everyone has the equal right to be elected.
However, it will cost one several million US dollars to run for the congressman and even more for the presidency.
However, there are very few people who have so much money to cover the cost.
We all know that none of the last candidates who run for the presidency in America are not millionaire [np3,s-] or billionaire [np3,s-] So the "equal" rights to vote and the "equal" rights to be elected are actually seperated [fm1,-] and the right to be voted is only a "patented article" of the millionaires, or the billionaires.
So, to be a president of America is only a wonderful dream of the common citizens of America and it will never be possible for the common citizens to be a president, no matter how equal they are.
So I have to say "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" Moreover, some white men are more equal [aj3,1-] than some black men.
White men are still having better education, are living in better houses, and are occupying higher positions.
However, the black men are still languishing in the corners of American society and find themselves exiles in their own land.
Although the black men have struggled for a long time for equal rights, the local authorities still reflect the popular prejudices against the black; there are many cases of injustice.
The riot in Los Angels broke out a few years ago just because of the police brutality against the black.
In fact, the black men are still the victims of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.
So, what we can say is still "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others.
" (t10-19) I think today it is still true to say "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.
" The famous saying was first written by George Orwell in his novel "Animal Farm".
The novel tells a story of an animal kingdom.
At first all the animals lived and worked together equally.
One day they rose up and drove their master away.
Then things changed.
Since a pig was elected as the leader of the kingdom, all the pigs realized that they were in a privileged position.
So they began to work much less than other animals or even stop working at all, and enjoy the best food produced by others.
Though other animals felt angry at the inequality, they dared not speak out, because the pigs raised a lot of fierce dogs to punished [vp5,1-] those who dared to defy their authority.
It's only a tale, but you can find [wd4,1-2] reflection of the huamn [fm1,-] society.
We know that all men are created equal.
But most of the time we can see some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Even in the United States, a country always shows great concern about human rights in other countries, the situation is not so satisfying.
Most of its black people are living in ghettos.
Their children cannot receive good education, and the adults cannot find good jobs.
If they do wrong, they would get more serious punishment than those white men.
Racial discrimination has prevented them from enjoying the prosperity which the white people are enjoying.
But little can be done to change it in a very short time.
The white men don't want to give the black men the same amount of wealth and opportunity, for fear that they would lose a lot, or even their dominion.
Only when people learn the exact meaning of "All men are equal", and keep it in heart, can the black men enjoy the same rights as the white.
It's obvious that those who have got some power can be more equal [aj3,1-] than other common ones.
They would set up rules for others to obey, but they themselves needn't obey it [pr3,s-] thoroughly.
So they become members of the group who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
We can find examples for this very easily.
The following is one.
Each year there are many students who would sit for the College Entrance Exam.
It is said that only those high-level students can win the competition and enter colleges.
But in fact, we can see that many students of lower marks can enter a better college and choose a better speciality to study.
People can do nothing to stop it but complain.
They just think it very natural for those with power to make use of their power, they would make full "use" of the power as well.
It's almost a truth that men are selfish animals.
And it seems impossible for all the men to overcome it.
So the fact that there are always some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others still exists today, and will last for a long long time.
(t10-20) In his novel, Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others".
At that time, it was considered as a reflection of the situation in the Soviet Union.
Dozens of years has now passed since it was written in 1930s, from my point of view, it is still true today, although the world has changed a lot.
In every country all over the world, you can easily perceive that the case still remains true.
But let's be specific by taking American society as an example.
In the American Constitution it was declared officially that all men are created eqaul [fm1,-] But in effect, it was not the case.
As a result, unequality [fm2,-] together with other factors begat [fm1,-] the American Civil War.
Though after the war Negroes were set free, it was nominal.
Negroes are still contempted [wd2,s-] and are not as equal as the whites.
Still remember the accident in which the victim, a black person broke the traffic law, [wd4,s-] took place in Los Angeles two years ago?
I was surprised to hear that instead of being punished in the legal way, he got brutal beating by two white policemen as his punishment.
More unexpectedly, after the controversial trial, the two white policemen were declared inguilty [fm2,-] Though the case is on trial again under the public pressure and the result is still unknown, we can come to a conclusion from what we have learned so far that in America, the country which calls itself the most equal society in the world, there still exist some people who are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
Let's look at the American society once more.
The constitution says every citizen has the right to vote as well as the right to stand for election.
The reality is another story.
In America, when you have a desire to run for Senator [wd3,s-] President [wd3,s-] or whatever it is, it is quite impossible for you to get the upper hand over your opponents if you have no strong backup.
Closer to the point, you will lose in whatever election it is without sufficient money support.
At [wd3,-2] such circumstance [np6,2-] you cannot afford the expensive fee of the publicity which will certainly help to make you familiar to the public and as a result will do good to your victory.
Since not all American citizens are billionaires or millionaire [np3,s-] those who are not, I must say most of them are not, will by all means not hold their own with those who are.
Thus, in a sense, most of the American citizens have no right to be elected at all.
In another word, the rich are more equal [aj3,1-] than others.
So, in a nutshell, the case which George Orwell described sixty years ago remains true.
(t10-21) The Declaration of the [wd5,3-1] Independence says: All men are created equal.
Equality, which men have been persued [fm1,-] struggled for and dreamed of for thousands of years, is still our dreams.
Some people are more equal [aj3,1-] than the others among our equally-born creatures.
It is not surprising, [wd4,s-] in China especially in the countryside, men account for most of the people who ask for divorce in the court.
A woman will be in a great trouble if she puts forward a claim for breaking up her marriage.
She will be thought to be adultering [fm2,-] or degenerated.
The rumors and slanders will engulf her.
But it is quite natural for a man to submit a case for divorcing his wife.
In a family, the wife is dominated by her husb
